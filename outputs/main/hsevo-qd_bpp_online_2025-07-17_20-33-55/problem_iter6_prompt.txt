Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        target_relative_residual: Ideal relative residual capacity after placing item.\n        random_priority_scale: Scale of random constant added to priorities.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # 1.

Maximize bin utilization: Prefer bins where the item fills a large portion\n    # of the remaining capacity, but not too large that it creates near-empty bins\n    # with the next item.\n    \n    # Fill ratio: item size / remaining capacity.

Continuously re-evaluate and dynamically adjust the weights given to different objectives (e.g., fill, waste, feasibility) based on performance feedback.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static, single-objective rules, hardcoded parameters, neglecting interdependencies between objectives.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics dynamically balance conflicting objectives. Parameter configuration and objective prioritization should adapt based on problem characteristics and performance feedback, not fixed assumptions.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
