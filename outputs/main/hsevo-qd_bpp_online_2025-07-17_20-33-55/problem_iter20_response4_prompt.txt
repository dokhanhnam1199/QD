Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see 2nd focuses on fill ratio and target relative residual, whereas 19th adds adaptive weighting based on bin utilization to adjust the waste penalty. 19th also includes fullness bonus. 19th more adaptive than 2nd. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are nearly identical, differing only in the specific values of `target_relative_residual` and `random_noise_scale`. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical as well. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see 19th is way more complex and adaptive, including normalized metrics, adaptive weighting, and bin utilization, compared to the barebones approach of 20th. Overall: Better heuristics include feasibility checks, aim to maximize bin utilization through fill ratios, target a specific relative residual capacity, and incorporate adaptive elements like dynamically adjusting waste penalties based on bin utilization. Bonuses for fullness and penalties for waste are also beneficial. Simpler approaches solely based on fill ratios tend to perform worse. Adaptive strategies that respond to the current state of the bins lead to improved packing. Adding a small degree of randomness can help to break ties.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable advice while avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection.\" We'll aim for specific, insightful guidance.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, dynamic adaptation, problem-specific tuning, controlled randomness.\n\n*   **Advice:** Frame heuristic design as a multi-objective optimization problem. Explicitly define and balance competing goals (e.g., fill rate, feasibility, fragmentation). Implement dynamic adaptation of weights and parameters based on observed performance and instance characteristics.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Generic statements like \"consider multiple factors\" or \"avoid oversimplification.\" Steer clear of suggesting hardcoding parameters or redundant testing.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics often require balancing several factors. Implement mechanisms for the heuristic to learn from the specific bin packing instance. Carefully consider and tune randomness to promote broader exploration of the solution space without completely disrupting the process.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
