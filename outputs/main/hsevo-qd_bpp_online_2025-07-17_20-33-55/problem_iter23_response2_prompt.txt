Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

They consider fill ratio, residual capacity, low waste bonus, and tie-breaking noise.\n*   Comparing (13th) vs (14th), we observe that both involve fill ratio, residual target, adaptive waste bonus, and noise, with the 13th using more parameters.\n*   Comparing (16th) vs (17th), the key difference lies in almost full bin prioritization.\n\nOverall: Better heuristics incorporate more factors (feasibility check, fill ratio, waste penalty, fullness bonus), use adaptive weighting and bonus, and add a small noise to avoid identical priorities.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to focus on actionable insights for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls identified in \"Ineffective Self-Reflection.\"\n\nHere's a redefined self-reflection focusing on concrete actions:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor evaluation, Dynamic weights, Adaptive parameters, Controlled exploration, Explicit constraints, Prioritization mechanisms, Configurable parameters, Performance feedback.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering *multiple* interacting objectives (feasibility, fill ratio, waste).  Employ dynamic weights that adapt based on real-time performance indicators (e.g., bin utilization, constraint violations). Incorporate *configurable* parameters to allow for fine-tuning and adaptation to diverse problem instances. Introduce controlled randomness judiciously to encourage exploration.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Single-factor decision-making, hardcoded parameters, ignoring constraints, static or overly simplistic weights, lack of adaptive behaviour and relying solely on pre-existing strategies.\n\n*   **Explanation:** This approach moves beyond simply *mentioning* multiple factors. It emphasizes actively *using* them through dynamic weighting and adaptive parameters. It pushes for configurable elements so that they can be refined through observation. Controlled randomness ensures exploration while explicitly acknowledging the need for feasibility.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
