Okay, here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing heuristics, aimed at avoiding common pitfalls and promoting more effective strategies:

*   **Keywords:** Holistic assessment, dynamic adaptation, configurable parameters, emergent behavior.

*   **Advice:** Focus on understanding the *interplay* between different factors influencing the objective function, not just their individual contributions. Design mechanisms for the heuristic to *learn* and *adapt* its behavior based on observed performance and problem characteristics.

*   **Avoid:** Rigid parameterization, static weighting schemes, and predefined rules that cannot evolve. Resist the urge to over-engineer by prematurely focusing on low-level implementation details.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply *considering* multiple factors. Aim to create a system where those factors interact in a way that generates emergent, intelligent behavior. Think of parameters as dials to *influence* this behavior, rather than fixed instructions.
