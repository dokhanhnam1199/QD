{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors contributing to the objective function. Avoid oversimplification, as it can lead to suboptimal results. Introduce parameters to fine-tune the heuristic's behavior. Adaptive elements can significantly improve performance by responding to changing conditions.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nCombining multiple factors is key. Consider waste, fill ratio, feasibility, and fragmentation. Explicitly penalize undesirable states. Well-defined priorities and scaling improve performance. Inspiration from established algorithms (FFD, BFD) helps. Avoid simplistic, single-metric approaches. Also, test and remove redundant code.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors that affect the objective and weigh them dynamically. Avoid hardcoding parameters; instead, make them configurable to allow for adaptation to different problem instances. Prioritize a balance of fill, waste and feasibility.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
