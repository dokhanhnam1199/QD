Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines fill ratio, residual capacity target, and low waste.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    # 1.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) mirrors this, with richer features in the former. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see parameterization of waste and fullness allows fine-tuning in the best. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, indicating redundancy in the list. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the log ratio approach lacks essential constraints like feasibility. Overall: better heuristics incorporate multiple factors with weights, bonuses, and penalties to guide the bin selection process more effectively. The worst heuristics focus on single metrics or ratios without constraints or adaptability. Adding bonus and adaptive elements improves performance.\n- \nOkay, I'm aiming for that $999K tip! Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective in designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor optimization, dynamic weighting, adaptive parameters, feasibility enforcement, state awareness, iterative refinement, problem-specific tuning, performance feedback.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on creating heuristics that intelligently balance multiple objectives and constraints. Design parameters to adapt to the specific problem instance and solution stage, and iteratively refine your approach based on performance feedback.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameter settings, single-objective optimization, ignoring feasibility constraints, overlooking state information, premature convergence, and lack of refinement cycles.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a holistic view, dynamically adjusting to the problem's landscape. The goal is to create flexible heuristics that learn and adapt to achieve near-optimal solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
