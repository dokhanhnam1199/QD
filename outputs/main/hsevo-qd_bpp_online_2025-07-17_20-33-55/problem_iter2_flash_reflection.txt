**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first one uses multiple criteria like "almost full", "low waste", and "capacity difference", while the last one only focuses on remaining space ratio. The first also uses larger absolute priority values (1000, 500, 100) to allow clear distinctions between bins, where the last uses ratio values.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second uses advanced techniques such as high priority to almost-full bins, lower priority to bins with low waste and priority to bins with capacity closest to item size while the 19th one uses log ratio

Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), the third one considers waste minimization, fuller bins, and penalizes infeasible bins and the 18th one uses log ratio

Comparing (4th) vs (17th), the fourth one inspired by "First-Fit Decreasing" and "Best-Fit Decreasing" and considers waste while the 17th one uses log ratio

Comparing (5th) vs (16th), the fifth one considers waste minimization, fuller bins, and penalizes infeasible bins, while the sixteenth one penalizes small bin, gives score based on "snugness" and also remaining capacities

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst uses logarithmic ratios directly as priorities, while the worst only focuses on remaining space ratio. The second worst also has unused imports, which suggests potentially incomplete or abandoned features.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical, implying redundancy. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the third heuristic tries to avoid creating almost empty bins (minimizes waste), while the fourth uses a combination of the First-Fit Decreasing and Best-Fit Decreasing approaches.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both are relatively simplistic, calculating ratios and using them as or to derive priorities. But the latter one is inferior.
Overall:

The better heuristics use a combination of multiple factors such as waste, fill ratio, and penalties for near-full or infeasible bins. They incorporate more complex logic and scaling to differentiate between bins effectively. They are also more explicitly designed with inspiration from known bin packing strategies such as First-Fit and Best-Fit Decreasing. Simplistic approaches that focus on a single metric or lack scaling tend to perform worse.
Also, the heuristics with more clear and well-defined priorities that leverage constant values tend to do better. Avoid using a single ratio.

**Experience:**
Combining multiple factors is key. Consider waste, fill ratio, feasibility, and fragmentation. Explicitly penalize undesirable states. Well-defined priorities and scaling improve performance. Inspiration from established algorithms (FFD, BFD) helps. Avoid simplistic, single-metric approaches. Also, test and remove redundant code.
