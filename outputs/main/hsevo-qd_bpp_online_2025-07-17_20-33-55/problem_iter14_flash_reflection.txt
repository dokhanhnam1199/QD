**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic prioritizes feasibility, manages waste (penalizing small waste and rewarding fullness), and adds noise for differentiation, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the fill ratio. (2nd) vs (19th) is similar to (1st) vs (20th). (3rd) vs (18th) is similar to (1st) vs (20th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic incorporates explicit waste and fullness considerations with tunable weights, while the second focuses on a target relative residual capacity. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst includes the standard imports. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors (feasibility, fill ratio, waste management, fullness), often with tunable parameters, and add a small amount of noise to break ties. Simpler heuristics rely primarily on fill ratio and lack specific mechanisms to handle waste or prioritize bin completion. Adaptive bonuses and capacity thresholds help improve performance.

**Experience:**

Complex heuristics generally outperform simple ones in bin packing. Consider multiple factors (feasibility, waste, fullness), tunable weights, and tie-breaking mechanisms. Adaptive strategies and capacity thresholds can further enhance performance.
