Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                fullness_bonus_weight: float = 0.2013748833676067, noise_level: float = 2.0819988765816894e-09) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        waste_penalty_weight: Weight of the small waste penalty.\n        fullness_bonus_weight: Weight of the bonus for bins closer to full.\n        noise_level: Magnitude of the random noise added to priorities.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective in designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor optimization, dynamic weighting, adaptive parameters, feasibility enforcement, state awareness, iterative refinement, problem-specific tuning, performance feedback.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on creating heuristics that intelligently balance multiple objectives and constraints. Design parameters to adapt to the specific problem instance and solution stage, and iteratively refine your approach based on performance feedback.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameter settings, single-objective optimization, ignoring feasibility constraints, overlooking state information, premature convergence, and lack of refinement cycles.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a holistic view, dynamically adjusting to the problem's landscape. The goal is to create flexible heuristics that learn and adapt to achieve near-optimal solutions.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
