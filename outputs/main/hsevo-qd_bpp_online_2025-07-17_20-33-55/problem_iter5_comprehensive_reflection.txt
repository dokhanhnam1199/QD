Here's a redefined self-reflection approach for designing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Configurable, Multi-objective, Dynamic priorities, Trade-off analysis.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with parameters adjustable to problem instance characteristics. Continuously re-evaluate and dynamically adjust the weights given to different objectives (e.g., fill, waste, feasibility) based on performance feedback.

*   **Avoid:** Static, single-objective rules, hardcoded parameters, neglecting interdependencies between objectives.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics dynamically balance conflicting objectives. Parameter configuration and objective prioritization should adapt based on problem characteristics and performance feedback, not fixed assumptions.
