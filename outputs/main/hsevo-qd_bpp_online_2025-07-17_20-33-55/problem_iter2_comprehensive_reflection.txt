Okay, here's a redefinition of "Current Self-Reflection" designed to guide the creation of better heuristics, while actively avoiding pitfalls of ineffective reflection, and focusing on actionable advice:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, penalty-based, priority-driven, algorithm-inspired, code simplification.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that balance competing objectives (waste, fill ratio, etc.) using weighted penalties reflecting their importance. Prioritize key decision factors through scaling and ordering.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single metrics, neglecting established algorithms, and code redundancy.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should be nuanced, mimicking successful algorithms, while penalizing undesirable states based on a priority order, all while striving for simplicity and efficiency in code.
