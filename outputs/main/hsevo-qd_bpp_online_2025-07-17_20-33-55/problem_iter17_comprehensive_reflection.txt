Okay, I understand! We need to redefine "Current Self-Reflection" by focusing on actionable insights for better heuristic design, while consciously avoiding the weaknesses evident in the "Ineffective Self-Reflection" examples.

Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focusing on actionability and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multi-Factorial, Configurable, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to the problem instance by incorporating a combination of relevant factors with configurable parameters and validation checks.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches, hardcoded parameters, reliance solely on established algorithms without adaptation, neglecting feasibility.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should be adaptive and consider multiple factors with tunable weights to optimize for diverse scenarios. Validation is crucial to avoid infeasible solutions. Avoid premature optimization by focusing on modular design and the ability to easily adjust the heuristic's behavior based on feedback.
