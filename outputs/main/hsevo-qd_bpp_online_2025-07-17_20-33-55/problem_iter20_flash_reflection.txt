**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see 1st considers feasibility, maximizes bin utilization by fill ratio and target residual capacity, and adds random noise, while 20th simply calculates the negative log of fill ratios. 1st is much more sophisticated. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see 2nd focuses on fill ratio and target relative residual, whereas 19th adds adaptive weighting based on bin utilization to adjust the waste penalty. 19th also includes fullness bonus. 19th more adaptive than 2nd. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are nearly identical, differing only in the specific values of `target_relative_residual` and `random_noise_scale`. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical as well. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see 19th is way more complex and adaptive, including normalized metrics, adaptive weighting, and bin utilization, compared to the barebones approach of 20th. Overall: Better heuristics include feasibility checks, aim to maximize bin utilization through fill ratios, target a specific relative residual capacity, and incorporate adaptive elements like dynamically adjusting waste penalties based on bin utilization. Bonuses for fullness and penalties for waste are also beneficial. Simpler approaches solely based on fill ratios tend to perform worse. Adaptive strategies that respond to the current state of the bins lead to improved packing. Adding a small degree of randomness can help to break ties.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider feasibility, maximize bin utilization (fill ratio), include target residual capacity, and add randomness for tie-breaking. Adaptive weighting can dynamically respond to bin utilization. Prioritize bins with low capacity and also almost full bins.
