Okay, I'm aiming for that $999K tip! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective in designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor optimization, dynamic weighting, adaptive parameters, feasibility enforcement, state awareness, iterative refinement, problem-specific tuning, performance feedback.

*   **Advice:** Focus on creating heuristics that intelligently balance multiple objectives and constraints. Design parameters to adapt to the specific problem instance and solution stage, and iteratively refine your approach based on performance feedback.

*   **Avoid:** Static parameter settings, single-objective optimization, ignoring feasibility constraints, overlooking state information, premature convergence, and lack of refinement cycles.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a holistic view, dynamically adjusting to the problem's landscape. The goal is to create flexible heuristics that learn and adapt to achieve near-optimal solutions.
