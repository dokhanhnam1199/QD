Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(11th) vs (20th) shows earlier ones balance fill, waste, and feasibility, assigning specific priorities based on bin fullness and waste levels, while the last only uses log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the better one has configurable \"target_relative_residual\" and \"random_priority_scale\", the worse one hardcodes these values. Comparing (16th) vs (20th), the earlier one uses normalized waste, exponential penalty, fill reward, and a bonus for nearly full bins, while the last only uses log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (16th), the better one uses \"target_relative_residual\" and \"random_priority_scale\" and fill ratios penalized by residual capacity. (11th) vs (16th), 11th gives fixed high priorities to almost full and low waste bins. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the earlier one uses fill ratios penalized by the difference between the relative residual capacity and a target, adding a small random constant. Overall, the better heuristics incorporate more factors like target residual capacity, waste minimization, and dynamic scoring based on bin utilization, while the worse heuristics rely on simpler calculations and hardcoded values.\n- \nHere's a redefined self-reflection approach for designing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Configurable, Multi-objective, Dynamic priorities, Trade-off analysis.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with parameters adjustable to problem instance characteristics. Continuously re-evaluate and dynamically adjust the weights given to different objectives (e.g., fill, waste, feasibility) based on performance feedback.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static, single-objective rules, hardcoded parameters, neglecting interdependencies between objectives.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics dynamically balance conflicting objectives. Parameter configuration and objective prioritization should adapt based on problem characteristics and performance feedback, not fixed assumptions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
