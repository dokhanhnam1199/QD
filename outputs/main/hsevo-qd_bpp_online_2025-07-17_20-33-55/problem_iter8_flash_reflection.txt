**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristics includes more factors such as feasibility check, waste, fill ratio, and bonuses, while the worst only considers log ratios. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the second-best is identical to the first, while the second worst is identical to the worst. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see there is no difference in the code. (3rd) vs (4th) introduces the concept of `target_relative_residual` and `random_priority_scale` which are parameters absent in (1st) (2nd) and (3rd). Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there's no difference in the code. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate more complex logic, considering factors beyond simple fill ratios, and allow for fine-tuning via parameters. Simpler approaches focusing solely on ratios tend to perform worse. Adaptive elements, like the aggressive fill and capacity threshold, improve performance by tailoring the heuristic's behavior based on the current state.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors contributing to the objective function. Avoid oversimplification, as it can lead to suboptimal results. Introduce parameters to fine-tune the heuristic's behavior. Adaptive elements can significantly improve performance by responding to changing conditions.
