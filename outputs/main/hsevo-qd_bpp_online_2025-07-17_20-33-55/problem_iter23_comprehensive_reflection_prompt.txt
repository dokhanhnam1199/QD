{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize feasibility, balance fill ratio with waste management, and incentivize fullness. Adaptive weights based on bin utilization can enhance performance. Introducing controlled randomness aids in exploration and prevents premature convergence.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nCombining multiple factors is key. Consider waste, fill ratio, feasibility, and fragmentation. Explicitly penalize undesirable states. Well-defined priorities and scaling improve performance. Inspiration from established algorithms (FFD, BFD) helps. Avoid simplistic, single-metric approaches. Also, test and remove redundant code.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors that affect the objective and weigh them dynamically. Avoid hardcoding parameters; instead, make them configurable to allow for adaptation to different problem instances. Prioritize a balance of fill, waste and feasibility.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors contributing to the objective function. Avoid oversimplification, as it can lead to suboptimal results. Introduce parameters to fine-tune the heuristic's behavior. Adaptive elements can significantly improve performance by responding to changing conditions.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interplay. Use weights and bonuses to prioritize different aspects, and incorporate feasibility checks to ensure valid solutions. Fine-tune parameters and adapt to the current state of the problem for better performance.\n\nComplex heuristics generally outperform simple ones in bin packing. Consider multiple factors (feasibility, waste, fullness), tunable weights, and tie-breaking mechanisms. Adaptive strategies and capacity thresholds can further enhance performance.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider incorporating multiple relevant factors with tunable weights, handling edge cases explicitly, and adding adaptive elements to adjust behavior dynamically.  Avoid hardcoding parameters and strive for a balance between exploitation and exploration by introducing small noise.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider feasibility, maximize bin utilization (fill ratio), include target residual capacity, and add randomness for tie-breaking. Adaptive weighting can dynamically respond to bin utilization. Prioritize bins with low capacity and also almost full bins.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
