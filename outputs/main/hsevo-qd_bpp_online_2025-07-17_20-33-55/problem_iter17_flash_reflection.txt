**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic incorporates weights for waste penalty and fullness bonus, along with a noise level, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the fill ratio. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the top heuristic explicitly considers waste and fullness while the 3rd focuses on target relative residual.  (3rd) vs (4th), we see that (3rd) uses a `target_relative_residual` parameter and a `small_constant`, whereas (4th) hardcodes these values. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst considers "capacity difference" and provides bonuses based on waste and fullness, whereas the worst only uses fill ratio. Overall: The better heuristics tend to use more factors (waste, fullness, etc.), adaptive elements (dynamic thresholds, bonuses), and configurable parameters whereas worse heuristics use fewer factors and/or hardcoded parameters. The best heuristics also handle edge cases like infeasible bins explicitly.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, consider incorporating multiple relevant factors with tunable weights, handling edge cases explicitly, and adding adaptive elements to adjust behavior dynamically.  Avoid hardcoding parameters and strive for a balance between exploitation and exploration by introducing small noise.
