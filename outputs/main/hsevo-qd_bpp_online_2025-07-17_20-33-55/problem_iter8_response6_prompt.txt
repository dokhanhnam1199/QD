Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the second-best is identical to the first, while the second worst is identical to the worst. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see there is no difference in the code. (3rd) vs (4th) introduces the concept of `target_relative_residual` and `random_priority_scale` which are parameters absent in (1st) (2nd) and (3rd). Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there's no difference in the code. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate more complex logic, considering factors beyond simple fill ratios, and allow for fine-tuning via parameters. Simpler approaches focusing solely on ratios tend to perform worse. Adaptive elements, like the aggressive fill and capacity threshold, improve performance by tailoring the heuristic's behavior based on the current state.\n- \nOkay, here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing heuristics, aimed at avoiding common pitfalls and promoting more effective strategies:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Holistic assessment, dynamic adaptation, configurable parameters, emergent behavior.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on understanding the *interplay* between different factors influencing the objective function, not just their individual contributions. Design mechanisms for the heuristic to *learn* and *adapt* its behavior based on observed performance and problem characteristics.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Rigid parameterization, static weighting schemes, and predefined rules that cannot evolve. Resist the urge to over-engineer by prematurely focusing on low-level implementation details.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply *considering* multiple factors. Aim to create a system where those factors interact in a way that generates emergent, intelligent behavior. Think of parameters as dials to *influence* this behavior, rather than fixed instructions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
