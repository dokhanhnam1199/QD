**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates feasibility checks, waste minimization, fill ratio maximization, a fullness bonus, and noise, while the worst only considers a logarithmic ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) mirrors this, with richer features in the former. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see parameterization of waste and fullness allows fine-tuning in the best. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, indicating redundancy in the list. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the log ratio approach lacks essential constraints like feasibility. Overall: better heuristics incorporate multiple factors with weights, bonuses, and penalties to guide the bin selection process more effectively. The worst heuristics focus on single metrics or ratios without constraints or adaptability. Adding bonus and adaptive elements improves performance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interplay. Use weights and bonuses to prioritize different aspects, and incorporate feasibility checks to ensure valid solutions. Fine-tune parameters and adapt to the current state of the problem for better performance.
