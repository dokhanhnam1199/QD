**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates feasibility checks, maximizes bin utilization by considering fill ratios and residual capacity, adds random noise for tie-breaking, whereas the worst heuristic only calculates ratios and log ratios, lacking crucial elements like feasibility and controlled exploration.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (9th), the best heuristic includes sophisticated waste management with waste penalty and fullness bonus, while the 9th only maximizes bin utilization.
*   Comparing (7th) vs (9th), we see 7th heuristic considered target residual, fullness bonus and noise level, while 9th only focus on maximizing bin utilization.
*   Comparing (10th) vs (12th), there are identical. They consider fill ratio, residual capacity, low waste bonus, and tie-breaking noise.
*   Comparing (13th) vs (14th), we observe that both involve fill ratio, residual target, adaptive waste bonus, and noise, with the 13th using more parameters.
*   Comparing (16th) vs (17th), the key difference lies in almost full bin prioritization.

Overall: Better heuristics incorporate more factors (feasibility check, fill ratio, waste penalty, fullness bonus), use adaptive weighting and bonus, and add a small noise to avoid identical priorities.

**Experience:**

Prioritize feasibility, balance fill ratio with waste management, and incentivize fullness. Adaptive weights based on bin utilization can enhance performance. Introducing controlled randomness aids in exploration and prevents premature convergence.
