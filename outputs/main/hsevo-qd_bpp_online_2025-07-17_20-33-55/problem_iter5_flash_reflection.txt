**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the earlier heuristics consider "target_relative_residual" and "random_priority_scale" for maximizing bin utilization and encouraging differentiation, whereas the last one only focuses on log ratios. (11th) vs (20th) shows earlier ones balance fill, waste, and feasibility, assigning specific priorities based on bin fullness and waste levels, while the last only uses log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the better one has configurable "target_relative_residual" and "random_priority_scale", the worse one hardcodes these values. Comparing (16th) vs (20th), the earlier one uses normalized waste, exponential penalty, fill reward, and a bonus for nearly full bins, while the last only uses log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (16th), the better one uses "target_relative_residual" and "random_priority_scale" and fill ratios penalized by residual capacity. (11th) vs (16th), 11th gives fixed high priorities to almost full and low waste bins. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the earlier one uses fill ratios penalized by the difference between the relative residual capacity and a target, adding a small random constant. Overall, the better heuristics incorporate more factors like target residual capacity, waste minimization, and dynamic scoring based on bin utilization, while the worse heuristics rely on simpler calculations and hardcoded values.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors that affect the objective and weigh them dynamically. Avoid hardcoding parameters; instead, make them configurable to allow for adaptation to different problem instances. Prioritize a balance of fill, waste and feasibility.
