Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable advice while avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." We'll aim for specific, insightful guidance.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, dynamic adaptation, problem-specific tuning, controlled randomness.

*   **Advice:** Frame heuristic design as a multi-objective optimization problem. Explicitly define and balance competing goals (e.g., fill rate, feasibility, fragmentation). Implement dynamic adaptation of weights and parameters based on observed performance and instance characteristics.

*   **Avoid:** Generic statements like "consider multiple factors" or "avoid oversimplification." Steer clear of suggesting hardcoding parameters or redundant testing.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics often require balancing several factors. Implement mechanisms for the heuristic to learn from the specific bin packing instance. Carefully consider and tune randomness to promote broader exploration of the solution space without completely disrupting the process.
