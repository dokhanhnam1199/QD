Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to focus on actionable insights for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls identified in "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a redefined self-reflection focusing on concrete actions:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor evaluation, Dynamic weights, Adaptive parameters, Controlled exploration, Explicit constraints, Prioritization mechanisms, Configurable parameters, Performance feedback.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering *multiple* interacting objectives (feasibility, fill ratio, waste).  Employ dynamic weights that adapt based on real-time performance indicators (e.g., bin utilization, constraint violations). Incorporate *configurable* parameters to allow for fine-tuning and adaptation to diverse problem instances. Introduce controlled randomness judiciously to encourage exploration.

*   **Avoid:** Single-factor decision-making, hardcoded parameters, ignoring constraints, static or overly simplistic weights, lack of adaptive behaviour and relying solely on pre-existing strategies.

*   **Explanation:** This approach moves beyond simply *mentioning* multiple factors. It emphasizes actively *using* them through dynamic weighting and adaptive parameters. It pushes for configurable elements so that they can be refined through observation. Controlled randomness ensures exploration while explicitly acknowledging the need for feasibility.
