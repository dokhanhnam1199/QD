"**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) Heuristics 1st vs (worst) Heuristics 20th, we see that the best uses a nuanced combination of penalties for leftover space (penalized logarithmically) and rewards for balanced packing, whereas the worst uses a simple combination of leftover space and a sinusoidal function that isn't as adaptive. (Second best) Heuristics 2nd vs (second worst) Heuristics 19th, we see that the second best dynamically weighs penalties and rewards without clipping, whereas the second worst redundantly calculates similar metrics across multiple heuristics with clipping and normalization. (1st) vs (2nd), we see the importance of non-linear penalties over simple linear ones. (3rd) vs (4th), we see that random imports and hardcoded parameters in (3rd) do not add value. (Second worst) vs (worst), we see that maintaining simplicity and avoiding unnecessary computations can improve performance.

Overall: The best heuristics incorporate dynamic, non-linear penalties and rewards, maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.

**Experience:**
For better heuristics, prioritize dynamic adaptive penalties, avoid redundant calculations, and utilize non-linear functions for penalties and rewards to enhance decision-making by focusing on efficient and balanced packing strategies."
