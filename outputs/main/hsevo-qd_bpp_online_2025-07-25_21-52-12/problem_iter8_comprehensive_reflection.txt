- **Keywords**: Dynamic adaptive penalties, non-linear functions, incremental learning, context-aware adjustments
- **Advice**: Leverage machine learning for incremental updates to penalties and rewards. Employ context-aware adjustments to consider varying conditions in the decision-making process.
- **Avoid**: Rigid penalty/reward setups, static weighting, excessive dependency on historical data, ignoring real-time changes in the environment.
- **Explanation**: Incorporating machine learning allows for continuous improvement and adaptation based on new data. Context-aware adjustments ensure that the heuristic remains effective under different conditions and avoids relying on outdated assumptions or overly simplistic models.
