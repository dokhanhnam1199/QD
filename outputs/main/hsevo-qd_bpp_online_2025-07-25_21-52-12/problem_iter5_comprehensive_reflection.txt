- **Keywords:** Dynamic Adaptation, Nuanced Strategies, Logistic Balance, Avoid Simplism
- **Advice:** Continuously refine heuristic algorithms through feedback loops, emphasizing adaptability and sophisticated penalty/reward structures.
- **Avoid:** Rigid weighting schemes, overcomplicated penalties, disjointed algorithms, and static decision-making frameworks.
- **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves creating heuristics that can adapt to new information and changing conditions, using balanced and logically structured penalties to guide improvement. Avoiding simplism ensures the heuristics can handle the complexity of real-world scenarios without becoming overly complicated or ineffective.
