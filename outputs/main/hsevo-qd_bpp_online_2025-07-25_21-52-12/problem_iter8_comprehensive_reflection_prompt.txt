{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nFor better heuristics, prioritize dynamic adaptive penalties, avoid redundant calculations, and utilize non-linear functions for penalties and rewards to enhance decision-making by focusing on efficient and balanced packing strategies.\"\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics by incorporating multiple factors\u2014space left, initial capacity, and future waste reduction\u2014while using advanced functions to dynamically adjust priorities. Avoid simplistic approaches and ensure penalties and encouragements are logically balanced.\"\n\nIncorporate dynamic weighting and nuanced penalty strategies to improve heuristics, avoiding repetitive models that lack adaptability.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
