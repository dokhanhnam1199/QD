"**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) Heuristics 1st vs (worst) Heuristics 20th, we see that the best utilizes a balanced approach considering both space left and leftover capacity penalization, while the worst does not consider relative initial space effectively when combining factors. (Second best) Heuristics 9th vs (second worst) Heuristics 19th, we observe that the second best incorporates multiple priority factors, such as ward priority, compactness priority, and size penalties, leading to a more sophisticated decision-making process compared to simply combining close bins and remaining capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (6th), (7th) vs (8th), (12th) vs (15th), (16th) vs (17th), and (18th) vs (20th) we notice minimal variations in structure and logic, indicating a consistent theme in early entries. (4th) Heuristics vs (5th) Heuristics implement a similar sinusoidal function to prioritize tight bins but lack the adaptive considerations present in Heuristics 1st. Heuristics 14th attempts to balance initial full capacity with future waste reduction, but its linear scaling of relative space might not prioritize bins effectively. (3rd) Heuristics vs (17th) Heuristics highlights the effectiveness of measuring waste reduction relative to bin size and incorporating an encouragement factor for less full bins. Overall:

**Experience:**
Design heuristics by incorporating multiple factors—space left, initial capacity, and future waste reduction—while using advanced functions to dynamically adjust priorities. Avoid simplistic approaches and ensure penalties and encouragements are logically balanced."
