- **Keywords**: Multi-criteria optimization, dynamic weighting, cross-validation, adaptive learning
- **Advice**: Implement sophisticated multi-criteria decision-making models that dynamically adjust weights of criteria based on real-time performance feedback. Incorporate adaptive learning mechanisms to refine heuristic parameters over iterations.
- **Avoid**: Static prioritization schemes, infrequent updates, lack of feedback loops, non-adaptive penalties/encouragements
- **Explanation**: Designing heuristics that dynamically respond to system state allows them to be more robust and adaptive. Multi-criteria optimization ensures a balanced consideration of all relevant factors, reducing the risk of over-emphasizing one aspect (like space left) at the expense of others (like future waste reduction).
