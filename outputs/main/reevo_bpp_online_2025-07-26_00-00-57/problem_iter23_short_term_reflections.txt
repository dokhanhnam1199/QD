Simplify penalties, focus on quadratic gaps, penalize infeasibility strictly, avoid inverse penalties on underuse.
Prioritize nearly full bins, use quadratic penalties for feasible gaps, strictly penalize infeasibility.
Apply penalties conditionally for feasible bins only, enhancing targeting of bins with optimal remaining capacity.
Simplify penalties, focus on quadratic gaps, penalize infeasibility strictly, avoid inverse penalties on underuse.
Simplify penalties, focus on quadratic gaps, penalize infeasibility strictly, avoid inverse penalties on underuse.
Normalize capacities less, penalize small bins more, weight priorities accordingly.
Reduce complexity, focus penalties, normalize consistently, and enhance feasibility prioritization.
Focus on quadratic penalties for gaps, avoid normalization, penalize strictly for infeasibility.
Simplify penalties, focus on quadratic gaps, penalize infeasibility strictly, and remove unnecessary underuse consideration.
Apply penalties conditionally for feasible bins only, enhancing targeting of bins with optimal remaining capacity.
