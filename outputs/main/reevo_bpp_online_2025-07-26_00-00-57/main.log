System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

Refer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `priority_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

[2025-07-26 00:04:12,726][root][INFO] - Short-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of times a bin has be used.
    It encourages packing smaller items into bins that are closer to their capacity limit to optimize space usage.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin, where capacity is the difference between bin size and current occupancy.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Heuristic prioritizes bins that have the most room left, but still need to densely fill up bins to avoid fragmentation.
    # Giving a lower priority score to bins with very low remaining capacity where the item might not fit.
    priority_scores = np.where((bins_remain_cap - item) >= 0, bins_remain_cap - item + 1, 0)
    
    # Added upper bound prioritization to encourage filling bins better:
    # For bins with high prior scores when the remaining space overflows sensibly high, we might want to allow some waste toBackPressed cache盛宴 coherence.
    # In those case, give an attenuation score bringing back items closer smaller feasibly fitting bins.
    priority_scores = priority_scores * (1 / (np.maximum(bins_remain_cap.mean(), bins_remain_cap.std()) + item))
    
    return priority_scores

[Better code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item itself (setting them to a very low priority), and further
    reduced if they are more full relative to their initial capacity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Original bin capacities
    bins_original_cap = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, bins_remain_cap.max() + 1)
    
    # Penalty for bins with less remaining capacity than the item (can't fit the item)
    penalties = (bins_remain_cap < item) * -np.inf
    
    # Calculate priority: moving closer to full has a priority proportional to the fullness
    priority = 1 - (bins_remain_cap / bins_original_cap)
    
    # Apply penalties to bins where the item can't be placed
    priority += penalties
    
    # Inverse so that closer to full but feasible slots get highest prio
    priority = -priority
    
    return priority

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Worse code]
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of times a bin has be used.
    It encourages packing smaller items into bins that are closer to their capacity limit to optimize space usage.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin, where capacity is the difference between bin size and current occupancy.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Heuristic prioritizes bins that have the most room left, but still need to densely fill up bins to avoid fragmentation.
    # Giving a lower priority score to bins with very low remaining capacity where the item might not fit.
    priority_scores = np.where((bins_remain_cap - item) >= 0, bins_remain_cap - item + 1, 0)
    
    # Added upper bound prioritization to encourage filling bins better:
    # For bins with high prior scores when the remaining space overflows sensibly high, we might want to allow some waste toBackPressed cache盛宴 coherence.
    # In those case, give an attenuation score bringing back items closer smaller feasibly fitting bins.
    priority_scores = priority_scores * (1 / (np.maximum(bins_remain_cap.mean(), bins_remain_cap.std()) + item))
    
    return priority_scores

[Better code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item itself (setting them to a very low priority), and further
    reduced if they are more full relative to their initial capacity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Original bin capacities
    bins_original_cap = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, bins_remain_cap.max() + 1)
    
    # Penalty for bins with less remaining capacity than the item (can't fit the item)
    penalties = (bins_remain_cap < item) * -np.inf
    
    # Calculate priority: moving closer to full has a priority proportional to the fullness
    priority = 1 - (bins_remain_cap / bins_original_cap)
    
    # Apply penalties to bins where the item can't be placed
    priority += penalties
    
    # Inverse so that closer to full but feasible slots get highest prio
    priority = -priority
    
    return priority

[Reflection]
Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize infeasible fits, normalize capacities, invert priorities.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize infeasible fits, normalize capacities, invert priorities.
Boost smaller gaps, penalize non-fitting bins strictly, consider item fragmentation impact.
Consider weighted scores, prioritize near-full bins, penalize non-feasible bins, and boost close-to-subtle gap bins.
Consider weighted scores, prioritize near-full bins, penalize non-feasible bins, and boost close-to-subtle gap bins.
Simplify logic, use sorting for gap evaluation, boost specific targets directly.
Boost smaller gaps, penalize non-fitting bins strongly, balance priorities with item size sensitivity.
Simplify logic, use sorting for gap evaluation, enhance readability with clear variables.
Use clear penalties for infeasible bins, prioritize filling bins that are closer to full, and keep calculations straightforward and efficiently normalizable.
Focus on scaling, penalizing underuse, and clear item capacity checks.
Focus on penalties for infeasible bins, prioritize remaining capacity linearly, and ensure no negative feasible priorities.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Prioritize near-full bins, penalize infeasible fits and gaps, normalize capacities, and maintain clear logic with readability.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Scale the priority score to avoid items being stuck in too small spaces
    base_priority = (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap

    # Penalize bins that have less capacity than the item itself
    penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -0.25, 0)

    # Penalize underused bins to avoid creating bins too small and leftover bins
    usage_discount = (bins_remain_cap.max() - bins_remain_cap)**2 * 0.01

    # Combine base priority, usage discount, and penalties into a final score
    priority_score = base_priority + usage_discount + penalty

    return np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.inf, priority_score)

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Scale the priority score to avoid items being stuck in too small spaces
    base_priority = (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap

    # Penalize bins that have less capacity than the item itself
    penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -0.25, 0)

    # Penalize underused bins to avoid creating bins too small and leftover bins
    usage_discount = (bins_remain_cap.max() - bins_remain_cap)**2 * 0.01

    # Combine base priority, usage discount, and penalties into a final score
    priority_score = base_priority + usage_discount + penalty

    return np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.inf, priority_score)
