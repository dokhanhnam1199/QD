Use normalized capacity differences for gap penalties, avoid redundant inf checks.
Focus on feasible bins, use quadratic penalties for gaps, simplify logic, prioritize nearly full bins effectively.
Avoid redundancy, focus on normalized gaps, penalize infeasibility, simplify calculations.
Prioritize nearly full bins, apply quadratic gap penalties, and severely penalize infeasibility.
Focus on feasible bins, use quadratic penalties for gaps, simplify logic, prioritize nearly full bins effectively.
Normalize capacities, penalize gaps quadratically, and exclude infeasible bins.
Use normalized capacities, penalize infeasibility, favor nearly full bins with quadratic gap penalties.
Focus on item fit, penalize underutilization, and maintain feasibility in priority scoring.
Prioritize nearly full bins, apply quadratic gap penalties, and severely penalize infeasibility.
Combine normalized capacity, usage discount, and penalties; ensure infeasible bins are strictly avoided.
