Normalize capacities, penalize gaps quadratically, adjust weights, emphasize feasibility.
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize infeasibility strongly, and avoid quadratic fullness disincentives.
Focus on normalization, penalize infeasibility strictly, and avoid excessive penalties for gaps.
Normalize capacities, penalize gaps quadratically, and clearly mark infeasible bins.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize gaps quadratically, penalize infeasibility strictly.
Simplify penalty structures, focus on feasible bins, use effective prioritization with quadratic penalties.
Prioritize bins with close fit, penalize underusage, ensure feasibility.
Combine remaining capacity, usage penalties, and normalize scores carefully. Prioritize near-full bins with penalties for underused bins.
Focus on normalized capacities, smooth penalties, and infeasibility management for balanced bin usage.
Simplify penalty structures, focus on feasible bins, use effective prioritization with quadratic penalties.
