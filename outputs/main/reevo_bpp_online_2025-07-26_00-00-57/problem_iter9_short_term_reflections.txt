Normalize capacities, penalize infeasibility, favor gaps near minimal, adjust penalties dynamically.
Normalize capacities, penalize gaps, avoid infeasibility; weight terms for balance.
Focus on penalizing larger gaps quadratically, normalize capacities, strictly penalize infeasibility.
Use quadratic gap penalties, normalize capacities, and strictly penalize infeasibility.
Avoid excessive penalties, normalize base priority, and ensure infeasible bins are strictly penalized.
Normalize capacities, penalize gaps, avoid infeasibility; leverage simpler calculations for efficiency.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize infeasible bins severely, use quadratic gap penalties for balanced logic.
Normalize capacities, penalize infeasibility, favor close gaps; avoid overly complex discounts.
Simplify scoring, prioritize fullness, penalize over-penalization, balance usage, avoid suboptimal gaps.
Normalize capacities, penalize infeasibility strictly, and favor bins with smaller gaps.
