Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize infeasible fits, normalize capacities, invert priorities.
Boost smaller gaps, penalize non-fitting bins strictly, consider item fragmentation impact.
Consider weighted scores, prioritize near-full bins, penalize non-feasible bins, and boost close-to-subtle gap bins.
Consider weighted scores, prioritize near-full bins, penalize non-feasible bins, and boost close-to-subtle gap bins.
Simplify logic, use sorting for gap evaluation, boost specific targets directly.
Boost smaller gaps, penalize non-fitting bins strongly, balance priorities with item size sensitivity.
Simplify logic, use sorting for gap evaluation, enhance readability with clear variables.
Use clear penalties for infeasible bins, prioritize filling bins that are closer to full, and keep calculations straightforward and efficiently normalizable.
Focus on scaling, penalizing underuse, and clear item capacity checks.
Focus on penalties for infeasible bins, prioritize remaining capacity linearly, and ensure no negative feasible priorities.
