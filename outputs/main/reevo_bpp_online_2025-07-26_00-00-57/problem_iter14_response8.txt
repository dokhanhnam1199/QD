def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation normalizes the remaining capacity, penalizes infeasibility,
    and prioritizes bins with near full capacity by penalizing larger gaps quadratically.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    penalty_infeasibility = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.inf, 0)
