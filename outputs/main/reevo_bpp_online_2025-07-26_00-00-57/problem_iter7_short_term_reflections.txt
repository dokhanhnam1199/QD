Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize infeasible bins strictly, balance usage with capacity penalties for better Bin Packing Performance.
Simplify logic, focus on capacity and usage balance, penalize infeasibility strongly, avoid excessive penalties or complexities.
Simplify logic, focus on capacity and usage balance, penalize infeasibility strongly, avoid excessive penalties or complexities.
Avoid negative penalties; use squared differences for gap penalization; and ensure all gaps are feasible.
Focus on normalization, infeasibility penalties, and prioritizing small gaps. Simplify calculations and balances.
