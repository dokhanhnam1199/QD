Simplify calculations, focus on fullness, penalize infeasibility, and reduce parameters for cleaner, effective heuristics.
Prioritize bins with less remaining capacity, penalize for insufficient item fit, use weighted scoring for better balance and efficiency.
Prioritize bins with least remaining capacity post-item addition and avoid severe fragmentation by inverting scores. Penalize fully filled bins heavily.
Prioritize bins with feasible fits, penalize small gaps, consider frequency less.
Boost single low-gap bins more; ensure clear, logic-driven prioritization adjustments.
Focus on reducing fragmentation by prioritizing bins nearly full but not avoiding bins already half full.
Use safe arithmetic, prioritize closest fit, penalize impossible fits.
Refine index handling, ensure unique selection, and maintain logical sequence for fragment prioritization.
Focus on feasible fits, prioritize second-largest gaps, avoid negative scores, penalize infeasible bins.
Prioritize bins with least remaining capacity, penalize bins that won't fit item, avoid negative priority scores for feasible options.
