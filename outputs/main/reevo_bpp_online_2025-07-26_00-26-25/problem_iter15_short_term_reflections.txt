Focus on proximity to fullness, penalize infeasibility strongly, favor early bins slightly to minimize fragmentation.
Simplify logic, focus on remaining capacity, penalize overfill, avoid complexity.
Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize infeasible ones, and favor earlier bins to minimize fragmentation and improve Online BPP performance.
Prioritize bins nearly full, penalize infeasibility, subtly favor earlier bins; adjust parameters via experimentation.
Prioritize bins by inverse remaining capacity, penalize nearly full ones, favor underused yet fitting ones.
Reduce half-full penalties, favor early bins, and heavily penalize overfills for better performance.
Simplify scoring, penalize overfills harshly, and target bins nearing fullness for better compactness and efficiency.
Simplify logic, focus on remaining capacity, penalize overhauling bins, avoid complex bonuses and thresholds.
Adjust thresholds, penalize overfills harshly, balance bins rationally, favor early bins.
Prioritize bins nearly full, penalize overfills harshly, favor early bins slightly.
