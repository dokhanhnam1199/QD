Simplify logic, focus on capacity differences, penalize infeasible bins, and prioritize near-complete bins without excessive computation.
Focus on fullness and penalize infeasibility clearly; reduce complexity by avoiding unnecessary computations.
Focus on fullness and penalize infeasibility. Simplify logic to enhance performance.
Prioritize feasible bins, penalize overfill, focus on large gaps, avoid half-full bins taking small items.
Simplify logic, penalize infeasibility harshly, minimize absolute gap, favor earlier bins, avoid complexity.
Focus on feasibility, proximity to fullness, and slight bias toward earlier bins.
Prioritize almost-full bins, penalize overuse; avoid half-full bins, use clear penalties for infeasibility.
Prioritize bins with smallest gaps, penalize infeasible bins, and avoid negative scores for unused bins.
Simplify calculations, focus on fullness, penalize non-feasibility, and use clear heuristics.
Avoid negative scores, use np.where for efficiency, balance fragmentation vs. half-full penalty.
