Incorporate inverse capacity, harsh penalties, and minimal early preference for balanced online BPP solutions.
Simplify scoring, prioritize nearly full bins, penalize excess usage, avoid early bin favoring for better adaptation.
Favor almost full bins, penalize overfills harshly, avoid overly full bins to maintain diversity.
Use positive scores, favor later bins, and avoid harsh penalties; gently guide bin selection with dynamic score adjustments.
Focus on reducing fragmentation by penalizing overfilled bins without early bin favoring.
Favor almost full bins, penalize overfills harshly, and avoid bins nearing full capacity strictly.
Favor almost full bins, penalize overfills harshly, and avoid bins nearing full capacity strictly.
Prioritize bins inversely by remaining capacity, penalize overfills harshly, and slightly favor earlier bins for balanced distribution.
Use simpler inversely proportional scoring, avoid tiny epsilon constants, maintain strict overfill penalties.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfills strictly, balance with early bins slightly favored.
