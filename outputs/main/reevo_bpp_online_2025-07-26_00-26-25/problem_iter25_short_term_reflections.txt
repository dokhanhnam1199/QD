Avoid negative scores; use gentle bin favoritism and positive reciprocal for remaining capacity.
Avoid penalizing nearly full bins; prioritize bins with reduced capacity less than half max.
Focus on nearly full bins, penalize overfills strictly, balance small item distribution.
Prioritize bins nearly full, penalize overfilled; favor near capacity over early bins; reduce fragmentation.
Focus on nearly full bins, penalize overfills, and consider max possible capacity for balance. Avoid rigid placement preferences for better packing efficiency.
Use inverse capacity for fit bins, harsh penalties for overfills, and minor early bin favoring reduces fragmentation, improves balanced packing.
Favor bins with less remaining capacity, penalize overfills strictly, and slightly favor early bins to balance load.
Avoid soft penalties; use harsh overfill penalties, simple early-bin favoring, and adjust inverse scale.
Prioritize almost-full bins, penalize overfills harshly, avoid overly full bins, favor remaining capacity instead of underfilled ones.
Avoid soft penalties; use harsh overfill penalties, simple early-bin favoring, and adjust inverse scale.
