Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize overfills, slightly favor earlier bins to reduce fragmentation.
Use inverse capacity, penalize overfills, favor early bins. Simplify scoring for clearer decision-making.
Adjust parameters, favor earlier bins more, and simplify the penalty strategy.
Use inverse capacity, penalize overfills, favor early bins. Simplify scoring for clearer decision-making.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfilled, and eliminate early bin bias.
Prioritize compact bins, penalize overfills, and slightly favor early bins to improve bin utilization dynamically.
Use inverse capacity, penalize overfills, favor early bins.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfills and overly empty bins; balance fragmentation and recent use.
Use inverse capacity for nearly full bins, penalize heavily for non-fit, favor early bins slightly but uniquely.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfills heavily, adjust for bin usage patterns to reduce fragmentation.
