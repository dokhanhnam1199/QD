    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation aims to reduce fragmentation and prefers bins that are
    almost filled while penalizing bins that exceed a certain capacity threshold.
    It favors early bins slightly, balances via near-full preference, and avoids
    early disqualification for balanced and effective packing.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.
