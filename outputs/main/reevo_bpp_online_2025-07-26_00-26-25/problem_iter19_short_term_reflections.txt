Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfills, favor earlier bins uniquely.
Use inverse capacity for priority, penalize overfills heavily, slightly favor earlier bins to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfills heavily, adjust for bin usage patterns to reduce fragmentation.
Incorporate inverse capacity, penalize overfills, favor earlier bins, simplify scoring logic.
Incorporate inverse capacity, penalize overfills strictly, slightly favor early bins.
Focus on inverse capacity, penalize overfills, simplify scoring.
Focus on clear prioritization, penalize overfills effectively, use simple decay for early bins, and avoid over-complex rules.
Adjust priority inversely with remaining capacity and increase early bin bonus significantly.
Favor nearly full bins, penalize overfills severely, adjust for earlier bins with decay.
Consider dynamic balancing, prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfills, and favor early bins.
