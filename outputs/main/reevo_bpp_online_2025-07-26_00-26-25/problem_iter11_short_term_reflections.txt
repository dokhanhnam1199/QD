Prioritize bins with less remaining capacity, penalize those that cannot fit, favor early bins slightly for reduced fragmentation.
Simplify scoring, prioritize feasible bins, favor fuller bins, consider earlier bins slightly.
Prioritize bins nearly full, penalize infeasibility, gently favor early bins to minimize fragmentation.
Simplify scoring, penalize overfills harshly, adjust threshold dynamically, favor earlier bins slightly, minimize penalties.
Focus on minimal gaps, avoid overfills, and subtly favor early bins using positive incentives.
Harsh penalties for overfills, adjust half-full cutoff, introduce small bin index bias.
Simplify logic, focus on remaining capacity, penalize overpacking, reduce complexity.
Simplify priority logic, penalize nearly full bins heavily, prioritize earlier bins slightly, favor larger capacity bins slightly.
Use positive incentives for bins near full, penalize overflow, and slightly favor earlier bins.
Simplify scoring, focus on feasibility and proximity to full, adjust early bin preference slightly.
