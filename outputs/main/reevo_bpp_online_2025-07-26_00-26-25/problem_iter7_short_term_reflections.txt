Focus on bin fullness, penalize non-fit, and streamline calculations for efficiency.
Favor almost full bins, penalize overfilled or nearly-overfilled bins, and prioritize efficient packing to minimize fragmentation.
Use positive scoring for feasible bins, penalize overfilled bins severely, favor early bins to reduce fragmentation.
Use negative remaining capacity for priority, penalize half-full bins rigorously, avoid infeasible negative scores directly.
Use feasible bins, penalize overfill, boost tight gaps, avoid half-full bins for small items.
Prefer full bins, penalize overfills, avoid negatives, favor early bins.
Avoid negative scores, favor bins with minimal remaining capacity, penalize overfill harshly, and bias towards early bins slightly.
Prioritize bins by fullness, penalize non-fitting, and simplify calculations for better performance and clarity.
Focus on feasible bins, penalize infeasibility, prioritize larger remaining capacities.
Use positive scoring for feasible bins, penalize overfilled bins severely, favor early bins to reduce fragmentation.
