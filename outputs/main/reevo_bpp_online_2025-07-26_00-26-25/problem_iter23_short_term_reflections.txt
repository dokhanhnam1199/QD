Use positive scores, prioritize lower capacities inversely, and favor early bins gently.
Use near-full bins, penalize overfills, slightly favor early bins, adjust coefficients.
Favor early bins, penalize overfills, and prioritize capacity proximity.
Use clear penalties, prioritize low remaining capacity, and subtly favor earlier bins with decay.
Prioritize bins nearly full, penalize overfills; avoid multiple small items in half-full bins; reduce mild favor early bins.
Focus on direct penalties, inverse capacity prioritization, and slight positional favoritism.
Use direct penalties, prioritize less remaining capacity inversely, favor earlier bins.
Invert capacity for priority, penalize overfills, slightly favor early bins.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize overfilled or too-large ones, and avoid rewarding early bin placement rigidly.
Focus on low remaining capacity, penalize overfills harshly, and slightly favor early bins for balance.
