Consider balancing fill proximity and recent bin usage, penalize overly packed bins, and favor underused capacity.
Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize infeasible ones, and slightly favor earlier bins for minimal fragmentation.
Simplify priority logic, focus on filling nearly full bins, reduce fragmentation by favoring early bins mildly.
Simplify scoring, prioritize feasible bins, penalize small capacities harshly, favor earlier bins slightly to reduce fragmentation.
Simplify priority scoring, focus on remaining capacity, and penalize bins over half full to reduce fragmentation.
Favor early bins, penalize overfills harshly, consider half-full bins, minimize remaining capacity.
Simplify priority scoring, focus on remaining capacity, and penalize bins over half full to reduce fragmentation.
Consider proximity to fullness, penalize infeasible bins, and slightly favor earlier bins to minimize fragmentation.
Consider harsher penalties for overfills, adjust half-full thresholds, and use linear biases for bin positions.
Prioritize earlier bins, penalize overfills harshly, dynamically adjust half-full penalties.
