**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates node proximity to the depot, demand considerations, angle to the depot, customer clustering, edge importance, and adaptive sparsification, while the worst only considers the inverse of the distance matrix.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), both are identical to the best heuristic. The 19th is also identical to the worst.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are also identical, meaning that the clustering is not influencing the rankings as the clustering code is in the better approaches.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both are identical.
Comparing (14th) vs (16th), both leverage distance, demand and node proximity. 14th then proceeds to sparsify the heuristic matrix using a dynamic threshold. The 16th lacks sparsification.
Overall: The best heuristics combine distance, demand, depot proximity, angle, customer clustering and adaptive sparsification based on edge importance. Sparsification helps prune the search space.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for CVRP, consider incorporating multiple factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, and angles. Adaptive sparsification based on edge importance can help reduce the search space and improve performance. Customer clustering may also provide gains.
