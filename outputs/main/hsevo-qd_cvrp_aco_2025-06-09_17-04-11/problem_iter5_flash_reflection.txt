**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates depot proximity, demand, angle to depot, and adaptive sparsification based on edge importance while the worst just returns the inverse of the distance matrix.
*   Comparing (6th) vs (11th), the heuristic 6th sparsifies the matrix while 11th not.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the best heuristic includes angle to depot and a more sophisticated adaptive sparsification strategy than the 6th. The adaptive sparsification involves calculating an edge importance and thresholding based on mean and standard deviation of edge importances. The best heuristic also normalizes the angles, while the 6th one doesn't consider angles.
*   Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), and (4th) vs (5th), we see no difference in the code.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there are no differences.
*   Overall: The top heuristics prioritize a combination of factors: distance, demand, depot proximity, and sometimes angle. Adaptive sparsification plays a crucial role in the best-performing heuristics. Sparsification helps to reduce the search space by eliminating less promising edges.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors (distance, demand, location). Adaptive sparsification is important for performance; use statistics of edge importance to prune unpromising edges. Start simple, then iteratively add and refine components based on performance.
