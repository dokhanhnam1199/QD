Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    CVRP heuristic: Combines distance, demand, depot proximity.\n    Sparsifies by setting low-probability edges to zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    n_nodes = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n\n    # Node Proximity to Depot\n    depot_distances = distance_matrix[0, :]\n    normalized_depot_distances = depot_distances / np.max(depot_distances) if np.max(depot_distances)>0 else np.zeros_like(depot_distances)\n    \n    # Demand Considerations\n    normalized_demands = demands / capacity\n    \n    for i in range(n_nodes):\n        for j in range(n_nodes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n\n            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]\n            if distance == 0:\n                continue\n\n            heuristic_value = (1 / distance) * (1 - normalized_demands[j]) * (1 - normalized_depot_distances[j])\n\n            heuristic_matrix[i, j] = heuristic_value\n\n    # Sparsify the matrix\n    threshold = np.mean(heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix > 0]) * 0.1 #Dynamic threshold\n    heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < threshold] = 0 #set low probability edges to 0.\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `heuristics_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to make it more effective for designing CVRP heuristics. We want actionable insights, not just general guidelines.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Performance Analysis, Bottleneck Identification, Adaptive Parameter Tuning, Diversity Maintenance.\n*   **Advice:** Rigorously test heuristics on diverse problem instances. Analyze solution quality, runtime, and failure modes to pinpoint weaknesses. Use these insights to guide refinements, focusing on the identified performance bottlenecks. Implement adaptive parameter tuning. Focus on diversity maintence of the solutions.\n*   **Avoid:** Vague notions of \"considering\" factors. Avoid relying solely on intuition without empirical validation. Avoid static parameter settings.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond general principles. Emphasize data-driven analysis to uncover specific areas for improvement and guide the development of more robust and effective heuristics. Adaptive tunning to adjust its parameters. Diversity maintence to escape local optimum.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
