- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into a more actionable approach for designing better heuristics.

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Iterative, Normalization, Statistics-driven.
*   **Advice:** Focus on blending diverse, normalized problem features (distance, demand, location) statistically. Iteratively refine heuristics based on edge importance and performance feedback.
*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on single factors, static approaches, neglecting normalization.
*   **Explanation:** This emphasizes a dynamic, data-driven process using combined, relevant factors for improved heuristic design. Normalization ensures fair feature weighting.
