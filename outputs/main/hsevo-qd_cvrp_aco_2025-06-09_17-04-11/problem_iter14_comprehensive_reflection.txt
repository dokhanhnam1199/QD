- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a refined take on "Current Self-Reflection" designed to boost heuristic design, particularly for CVRP, avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive Sparsification, Iterative Refinement, Diversity, Normalization, Clustering, Edge Importance.

*   **Advice:** Develop heuristics that intelligently combine distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, and customer relationships through clustering. Use adaptive sparsification based on edge importance to focus the search. Normalize inputs and iteratively refine heuristic components based on performance analysis.

*   **Avoid:** Solely relying on single-factor heuristics, neglecting data normalization, and premature convergence.

*   **Explanation:** Combine relevant factors, normalize your inputs and start with a simple algorithm, then iteratively refine components using adaptive sparsification, and diversity to boost performance.
