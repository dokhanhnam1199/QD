- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better CVRP heuristics, focusing on actionable advice derived from the given examples, and explicitly avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, adaptive sparsification, iterative refinement, edge diversity, clustering, normalization, edge importance.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that combine normalized, multiple relevant factors (distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, location). Implement adaptive sparsification based on learned edge importance.

*   **Avoid:** Relying on single-factor heuristics. Ignoring edge diversity and premature convergence. Overly complex initial designs.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance exploitation of promising areas (sparsification) with exploration (edge diversity, multi-factor analysis). Iterative refinement allows for data-driven improvement.
