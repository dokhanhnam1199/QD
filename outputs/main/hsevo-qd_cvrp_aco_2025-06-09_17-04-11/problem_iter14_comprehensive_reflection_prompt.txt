{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing CVRP heuristics, consider incorporating factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, clustering, and diversity. Employ adaptive sparsification to focus the search. Clustering via K-means can be more effective than simpler angular-based assignments. Normalization of input data improves performance.\nWhen designing heuristics for CVRP, always consider distance, demand, and depot proximity. Normalize these factors for proper weighting in the heuristic calculation. Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple relevant factors over those that rely on a single factor.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors (distance, demand, location). Adaptive sparsification is important for performance; use statistics of edge importance to prune unpromising edges. Start simple, then iteratively add and refine components based on performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for CVRP, consider incorporating multiple factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, and angles. Adaptive sparsification based on edge importance can help reduce the search space and improve performance. Customer clustering may also provide gains.\n\nWhen designing CVRP heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors like demand, depot proximity, angles, and clustering. Adaptive sparsification can help focus the search, and promoting edge diversity can prevent premature convergence. Start with a comprehensive approach and iteratively refine based on performance.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
