**Analysis:**

*   **Comparing (1st) vs (20th):** The best heuristic incorporates distance, demand, depot proximity, angle, customer clustering, adaptive sparsification, and edge diversity encouragement. The worst one only considers the inverse of the distance matrix.
*   **Comparing (2nd) vs (19th):** The second-best heuristic is identical to the first, showing redundancy or a lack of diversity in the tested variations at the top. The 19th also just returns the inverse of the distance.
*   **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** They are the same.
*   **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** Heuristic 3 includes edge diversity encouragement, while heuristic 4 does not.
*   **Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst):** Both only return the inverse of the distance matrix.
*   **Overall:** The better heuristics incorporate a wider range of factors, including demand, depot proximity, angles, clustering, and adaptive sparsification, to create a more nuanced evaluation of edge desirability. They also have more sophisticated sparsification methods. The worst heuristics consider only distance.

**Experience:**

When designing CVRP heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors like demand, depot proximity, angles, and clustering. Adaptive sparsification can help focus the search, and promoting edge diversity can prevent premature convergence. Start with a comprehensive approach and iteratively refine based on performance.
