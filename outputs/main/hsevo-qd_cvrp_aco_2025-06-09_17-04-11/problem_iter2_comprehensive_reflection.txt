- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more effective for designing CVRP heuristics. We want actionable insights, not just general guidelines.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Performance Analysis, Bottleneck Identification, Adaptive Parameter Tuning, Diversity Maintenance.
*   **Advice:** Rigorously test heuristics on diverse problem instances. Analyze solution quality, runtime, and failure modes to pinpoint weaknesses. Use these insights to guide refinements, focusing on the identified performance bottlenecks. Implement adaptive parameter tuning. Focus on diversity maintence of the solutions.
*   **Avoid:** Vague notions of "considering" factors. Avoid relying solely on intuition without empirical validation. Avoid static parameter settings.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond general principles. Emphasize data-driven analysis to uncover specific areas for improvement and guide the development of more robust and effective heuristics. Adaptive tunning to adjust its parameters. Diversity maintence to escape local optimum.
