**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates distance, demand, depot proximity, angle, adaptive sparsification, and diversity, while the worst only considers the inverse of distance. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the inclusion of a cluster bonus affects performance negligibly in this case. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors relevant to the CVRP, especially demand, depot proximity, angle to depot, clustering and diversity while also applying adaptive sparsification techniques. Clustering using K-means appears superior to cluster assignments based on angles. Normalization also helps.

**Experience:**
When designing CVRP heuristics, consider incorporating factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, clustering, and diversity. Employ adaptive sparsification to focus the search. Clustering via K-means can be more effective than simpler angular-based assignments. Normalization of input data improves performance.
