- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing CVRP heuristics to be more effective and actionable, avoiding the pitfalls of generic advice.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, Adaptive Sparsification, Iterative Refinement, Performance Metrics, Solution Diversity, Constraint Handling.

*   **Advice:** Quantify factor influence (distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, etc.) on solution quality. Focus on balancing exploration and exploitation through sparsification.

*   **Avoid:** Vague recommendations (e.g., "consider multiple factors"). Premature optimization without establishing a baseline.

*   **Explanation:** Rigorously test each heuristic component's impact using performance metrics like solution cost, runtime, and solution diversity. Consider constraint handling violations.
