**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the best heuristic considers distance, demand, and proximity to the depot, while the worst only considers the inverse of the distance.  (2nd) vs (12th) and so on, it's consistently the same. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th) ..., there is no difference in the code. Comparing (20th) vs (11th), no difference is found. Overall: The ranking highlights the importance of incorporating multiple factors into the heuristic, specifically demand and proximity to the depot, in addition to distance.  The better heuristics normalize these factors to ensure they are appropriately weighted. The worst heuristics only focus on distance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for CVRP, always consider distance, demand, and depot proximity. Normalize these factors for proper weighting in the heuristic calculation. Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple relevant factors over those that rely on a single factor.
