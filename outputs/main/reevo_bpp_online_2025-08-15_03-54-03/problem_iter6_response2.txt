    """Returns priority using a sigmoid-based function that favors bins with small positive residuals.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins where the remaining capacity (`r`) after placing the item
    is as close to zero as possible, but still non-negative. The sigmoid function
    `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` is used, where `k` is a sensitivity parameter.
    A higher `k` makes the priority drop faster as `r` increases.
    Bins where the item does not fit (i.e., `r < 0`) receive a priority of 0.
    The function is slightly modified to output a value closer to 1 for perfect fits (residual 0)
    and values closer to 0 for larger residuals, but still positive.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

        # To better prioritize perfect fits (residual=0) as higher priority,
        # we can transform the output or the input.
        # Let's shift the input: `exp(k * (residual - epsilon))` where epsilon is a small positive value.
        # Or, we can use `1 - sigmoid(-k * residual)` or `sigmoid(k * residual)`.
        # Using `sigmoid(k * residual)`:
        # - residual = 0  -> exp(0) = 1, score = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5
        # - residual = 0.01, k=15 -> exp(0.15) approx 1.16, score = 1 / (1+1.16) approx 0.46
        # This prioritizes smaller residuals, but 0.5 is not the peak.

        # Let's consider a modified sigmoid or a different function.
        # A simple approach for favoring smaller positive residuals is to use:
        # `max_capacity_penalty - residual` for fitting bins, where `max_capacity_penalty`
        # is a large value. This is similar to v0.

        # Let's stick with the sigmoid idea but adjust the output to have a clear peak at residual=0.
        # The function `1 / (1 + exp(-k * residual))` maps residual=0 to 0.5.
        # For residual < 0, it's < 0.5. For residual > 0, it's > 0.5.
        # This doesn't quite prioritize small POSITIVE residuals.

        # A better approach for small positive residuals might be:
        # `exp(-k * residual)` for residual >= 0.
        # This function gives 1 for residual=0, a value close to 1 for small positive residuals,
        # and a value close to 0 for large positive residuals.
        # It also requires handling the case where `bins_remain_cap` is very large,
        # which might lead to overflow in `exp`.

        # Let's refine the `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` approach.
        # We want higher scores for smaller `r` (where `r >= 0`).
        # The original `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` makes scores *lower* as `r` increases.
        # We need scores to be *higher* as `r` decreases (towards 0).
        # So, we should use a function that is decreasing with `r`.

        # Let's use `1 - sigmoid(k * residual)` which is `1 - 1 / (1 + exp(k * residual)) = exp(k * residual) / (1 + exp(k * residual))`.
        # This function maps residual=0 to 0.5.
        # For residual=0.01, k=15, exp(0.15) approx 1.16, score approx 1.16 / 2.16 approx 0.53.
        # For residual=1.0, k=15, exp(15) is large, score approaches 1. This is not what we want.

        # The initial `priority_v1` function's logic:
        # "When residual is 0 (perfect fit), score is 1 / (1 + exp(0)) = 0.5.
        # When residual is small positive (e.g., 0.01, k=15), arg is 0.15, score is ~0.53 (slightly higher priority)."
        # This means it *does* slightly prioritize smaller positive residuals.
        # The description in v1 seems correct for its implementation.

        # Let's try to make the priority *higher* for smaller residuals.
        # The function `exp(-k * residual)` for `residual >= 0` fits this.
        # `exp(-k * 0)` = 1 (highest priority for perfect fit)
        # `exp(-k * 0.01)` for k=15 is `exp(-0.15)` approx 0.86
        # `exp(-k * 1.0)` for k=15 is `exp(-15)` very small.
        # This maps well to the "tightest fit" idea.

        # To avoid potential overflow with large `k * residual` for negative residuals
        # (which would be `exp(large positive)`), we ensure `residual` is non-negative
        # when applying this exponential. The `can_fit_mask` already handles this.

        # Let's scale the output or adjust `k`.
        # Using `exp(-k * residual)` directly gives values between 0 and 1.
        # If we want the highest score to be clearly distinguishable, we can multiply by a factor or add an offset.

        # Let's try to implement the `exp(-k * residual)` strategy.
        # To ensure the score is higher for smaller `residual` (where `residual >= 0`).
        # We want `f(0) > f(0.01) > f(1.0)`.
        # `exp(-k * residual)` is a decreasing function for positive `k` and `residual`.

        # Consider the residuals for fitting bins.
        fitting_residuals = residuals[can_fit_mask]

        # If we want to prioritize bins that are almost full, we want smaller residuals.
        # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * residual))` gives higher values for smaller residuals.
        # The description of v1 is actually correct in that regard.
        # "When residual is 0 (perfect fit), score is 0.5.
        # When residual is small positive (e.g., 0.01, k=15), arg is 0.15, score is ~0.53 (slightly higher priority)."
        # This means it *does* favor bins with smaller positive residuals.

        # To make the priority *even more pronounced* for tight fits, we can increase `k`.
        # Alternatively, we can rescale the output.

        # Let's consider another approach: Rank the fitting bins by their residual.
        # The bin with the smallest residual gets the highest priority.
        # `priorities[can_fit_mask] = -fitting_residuals` would prioritize smallest residuals.
        # This is similar to v0 but without the offset.

        # The reflection specifically mentions sigmoid. Let's try to optimize the sigmoid usage.
        # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` gives a higher value for smaller `r`.
        # The description states that for `r=0.01` (positive small residual), the score is `0.53`, which is higher than `0.5` for `r=0`.
        # This implies that `priority_v1` *underrates* perfect fits compared to very small positive residuals.
        # This is counter-intuitive if "tightest fit" means residual closest to zero.

        # If we want residual=0 to have the highest priority, we need a function where
        # the maximum is at `residual = 0` and decreases as `residual` moves away from 0 (in positive direction).
        # `exp(-k * abs(residual))` could work, but we only care about `residual >= 0`.
        # So, `exp(-k * residual)` for `residual >= 0` is a good candidate.

        # Let's modify `priority_v1` to use `exp(-k * residual)` for fitting bins.
        # We want to give scores that reflect "how good" the fit is.
        # The function `exp(-k * residual)` maps `residual=0` to 1, `residual` slightly positive to <1, and large `residual` to near 0.
        # This seems to align better with prioritizing small positive residuals and perfect fits.

        # We can scale this to have a wider range of scores if needed, or to ensure
        # that "non-fitting" bins are clearly at the bottom.
        # The current `priorities` are initialized to 0, so non-fitting bins have score 0.
        # `exp(-k * residual)` will produce scores between (0, 1] for `residual >= 0`.
        # This ensures fitting bins always have higher priority than non-fitting ones.

        # Let's refine the `k` value. A higher `k` makes the priority drop faster.
        # With `exp(-k * residual)`, a higher `k` means smaller residuals get much higher priority.

        # Using the current `k = 15.0`:
        # residual = 0.0: exp(0) = 1.0
        # residual = 0.01: exp(-0.15) approx 0.86
        # residual = 0.1: exp(-1.5) approx 0.22
        # residual = 0.5: exp(-7.5) approx 0.00055
        # This clearly prioritizes smaller residuals.

        # The scores are already in a range that differentiates well.
        # No further scaling needed unless specific range is required.

        # Apply the exponential decay function for bins that can fit the item.
        # We use `residuals[can_fit_mask]` to only consider positive residuals.
        priorities[can_fit_mask] = np.exp(-k * residuals[can_fit_mask])

        # Ensure no NaN values if `k * residuals` is extremely large negative (which shouldn't happen with residual >= 0).
        # `np.clip` can be used for safety, but `exp` of negative numbers is always positive.
