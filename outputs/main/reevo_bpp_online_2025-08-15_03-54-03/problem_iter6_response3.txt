    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Best Fit strategy.

    The Best Fit strategy prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and
    then selects the bin that results in the smallest remaining capacity after
    packing. This version directly uses the negative of the *resulting* remaining
    capacity as the priority score.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        A higher score indicates a higher priority. Bins that cannot fit the
        item are given a score of -1. Bins that can fit the item are scored
        based on the negative of the remaining capacity after packing, favoring
        smaller remaining capacities (which result in higher negative scores).
