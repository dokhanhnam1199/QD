Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after placement. Adjust sensitivity `k` for desired behavior.
Prioritize smallest positive residuals for tighter packing, or directly use Best Fit for minimal waste.
Prioritize small positive residuals by maximizing negative residuals.
Prioritize minimizing waste by favoring tighter fits, directly reflecting remaining capacity.
Prioritize smaller remaining capacity. Invert for higher scores. Ensure valid initializations.
Focus on smooth, graduated priorities, not just inverse proportionality.
Prioritize by **inverse of remaining capacity** or **scaled difference** for tighter fits.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity for First Fit. Consider relative bin fullness.
Prioritize fitting bins with least remaining capacity. Avoid complex functions for simple goals.
Prioritize minimal positive residual. Focus on filling bins efficiently.
