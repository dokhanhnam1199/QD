    This heuristic prioritizes bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item

    more tightly. Bins where the item does not fit, or where the remaining capacity
    after placement would be exactly zero, will have the lowest priority.

    # For instance, use a very large number, but smaller than `1.0 / epsilon`.
    # Or, simply a slightly lower value than the maximum achievable from positive residuals.
    # A simple approach is to use a fixed high value, or a value derived from the 'best' positive residual.
    # For simplicity and to ensure they are considered but not preferred over tiny gaps,
    # let's assign a value that's still high. A slightly smaller reciprocal could work if we knew the minimum positive residual.
    # A common strategy is to use a large constant if the problem structure doesn't give a natural scaling.
    # Let's make it a very high priority, but clearly distinguishable.
    # The current `1.0 / residuals` will produce values that can be very large.
    # If we want to prioritize exact fits slightly lower than tightest fits, we could do:
    # max_possible_priority = 1.0 / epsilon # theoretical max if residuals are tiny positive
    # priorities[fits_exactly_mask] = max_possible_priority * 0.99 # or some large constant.
    # For this specific reflection, we are focusing on minimal *positive* residuals.
    # Bins that fit exactly (residual=0) are still good fits and should have high priority,
    # but the prompt implies prioritizing *positive* residuals.
    # Let's stick to the reflection's emphasis: minimal *positive* residuals.
    # Bins that fit exactly are less prioritized than those with minimal *positive* slack.

    # Update: The reflection is about favoring minimal *positive* residuals.
    # This means bins with `residual > 0` are preferred, and among those, the smallest `residual` is best.
    # Bins with `residual == 0` are not explicitly prioritized by the reflection's wording.
    # If we *must* prioritize minimal positive residuals, bins with residual=0 are not part of that.
    # However, in practice, an exact fit is often very desirable.
    # Let's adjust the priority to reflect the "minimal positive residual" focus precisely.
    # The original `1.0 / residuals` for `residuals > epsilon` already does this.
    # We can assign a moderate priority to exact fits to differentiate them.

    # Let's re-evaluate the goal: "prioritizes bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item
    # is as close to zero as possible, but still strictly positive."
    # This means `residual > 0` and `residual` is minimized.
    # The `1.0 / residuals` where `residuals > epsilon` handles this.
    # What about `residuals == 0`? The reflection implies they are less preferred than minimal *positive* ones.
    # So, our current setup where they get `-inf` is consistent with *only* prioritizing strictly positive residuals.
    # If an exact fit is desired, a different heuristic might be better.
    # Given the reflection, let's keep the distinction clear.

    # A common practical approach is to give exact fits a very high priority too.
    # For clarity based on the reflection:
    # - Bins with residual > epsilon: priority = 1.0 / residual
    # - Bins with residual == 0: priority = moderate_high_value
    # - Bins with residual < 0: priority = -inf

    # Let's assign a slightly lower priority to exact fits than the best possible positive residual fit.
    # The smallest positive residual would yield a priority close to 1/epsilon.
    # We can assign a value like 1.0 / (epsilon * 2) or a large constant.
    # For simplicity, let's use a value that's still high but bounded.
    # The logic is that a tiny positive gap is slightly preferred over no gap.
    # However, a pragmatic BPP solver would often consider exact fits excellent.

    # For the purpose of implementing the reflection strictly:
    # "prioritizes bins where the remaining capacity ... is as close to zero as possible, but still strictly positive."
    # This means bins with residual=0 are not candidates for the "best" priority according to this specific phrasing.
    # Let's refine: If `residuals > epsilon`, score is `1.0 / residuals`.
    # If `residuals == 0`, score is `some_value_less_than_min(1.0 / residuals[residuals > epsilon])`
    # If `residuals < 0`, score is `-inf`.

    # Let's refine the scoring for exact fits to be high, but less than ideal positive residuals.
    # The best score from `1.0/residuals` will be for the smallest `residuals > epsilon`.
    # Let's assign a score for exact fits that is high but bounded, and lower than any `1.0/positive_residual`.
    # For example, if epsilon=1e-9, the max theoretical priority is 1e9.
    # We can assign exact fits a priority like 1e8.

    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -float('inf')) # All bins start with lowest priority

    # Mask for bins that can fit the item and leave a strictly positive residual

    # Higher priority for smaller positive residuals

    # So, assign a value significantly less than 1/epsilon but still high.
    # A practical value could be related to the maximum possible number of bins or a large constant.
    # For example, if there are N bins, a priority of N or N*2 is usually sufficient to rank well.

    # For instance, if epsilon is 1e-9, 1/epsilon is 1e9. Let's use 1e8.
