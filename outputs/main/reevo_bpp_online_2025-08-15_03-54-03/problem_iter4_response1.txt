    """Returns priority using a strategy that favors bins with small positive residuals (Best Fit).

    This heuristic prioritizes bins where the remaining capacity (`r`) after placing the item
    is as close to zero as possible, but still non-negative. This is a direct implementation
    of the Best Fit strategy. Bins where the item does not fit (i.e., `r < 0`) receive a
    priority of 0.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Higher priority indicates a better fit for the item.
