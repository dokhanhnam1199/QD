Prioritize smaller remaining capacity for tighter fits. Favor simplicity and directness.
Prioritize bins with less remaining capacity for tighter fits, or use a simple first-fit approach.
Prioritize tight fits. Sigmoid functions can smoothly differentiate based on residual capacity.
Prioritize smaller remaining capacities for a tighter fit; negative remaining capacity is better.
Prioritize bins with minimal positive slack, avoiding exact zero for continuous scoring.
Prioritize minimizing residual capacity; use negative residual for higher scores.
Prioritize smaller remaining capacities; use smooth, decreasing functions for better fit.
Prioritize tight fits with graduated scores. Tune sensitivity. Explore non-linear transformations.
Prioritize tighter fits, but First Fit's sequential scan is also effective.
Focus on *relative* remaining capacity, not just inverse. Consider how to differentiate good fits.
