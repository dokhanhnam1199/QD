[Prior reflection]
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity *after* packing. Explore adjusting sensitivity to residual size for First Fit, favoring tighter fits to minimize bins and waste. The previous version `priority_v1` prioritized bins based on *current* remaining capacity, which is essentially First Fit. The reflection asks to prioritize based on *remaining capacity after packing*. This means we want to select the bin that, after the item is placed, has the smallest remaining capacity. This corresponds to the "Best Fit" strategy for BPP.

[Code]
```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Best Fit strategy.

    The Best Fit strategy prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and
    then selects the bin that results in the smallest remaining capacity after
    packing.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        A higher score indicates a higher priority. Bins that cannot fit the
        item are given a score of -1. Bins that can fit the item are scored
        based on the *remaining capacity after packing*, favoring smaller
        remaining capacities.
    """
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -1.0)  # Initialize with low priority (-1)

    # Calculate remaining capacity if the item fits in each bin
    potential_remaining_caps = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Identify bins that can fit the item
    can_fit_mask = potential_remaining_caps >= 0

    # For bins that can fit the item, assign a priority score.
    # We want to prioritize bins that will have the *smallest* remaining capacity
    # after packing the item. So, we use the potential_remaining_caps directly,
    # and we want to maximize this value (since higher score means higher priority).
    # A larger remaining capacity after packing is *worse* for Best Fit,
    # so we want to prioritize smaller values of potential_remaining_caps.
    # To make higher scores better, we can invert the priority, e.g., by
    # subtracting from a large constant.
    fitting_bins_potential_remaining = potential_remaining_caps[can_fit_mask]

    if fitting_bins_potential_remaining.size > 0:
        # To prioritize smaller remaining capacities (Best Fit), we can use
        # a large number minus the potential remaining capacity.
        # This way, a smaller potential remaining capacity results in a higher score.
        # We use a value larger than any possible potential remaining capacity.
        # The maximum possible original remaining capacity would be the bin capacity itself,
        # so a value larger than that plus item size is safe.
        max_original_cap = np.max(bins_remain_cap) if bins_remain_cap.size > 0 else 0
