[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` function implements a First Fit strategy by prioritizing bins with smaller remaining capacities. This is a reasonable starting point for online bin packing to minimize waste. However, it might be too greedy and not optimal for all cases. For instance, if a slightly larger bin leaves just enough space for a future, slightly larger item, it might be better than filling a smaller bin tightly. To address this, we can introduce a "Best Fit" component, prioritizing bins where the item fits most snugly (i.e., minimizes the *wastage* if the item is placed).

The "Best Fit" approach aims to minimize the remaining capacity *after* placing the item. So, for an item of size `item` and a bin with remaining capacity `bins_remain_cap[i]`, the wastage would be `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`. We want to minimize this wastage.

Therefore, a priority function inspired by Best Fit would assign higher priority to bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimized. This is equivalent to prioritizing bins where `bins_remain_cap[i]` is smallest among those that can fit the item. This is actually very similar to the current `priority_v1` logic.

Let's refine the reflection: the goal is to find a balance. While Best Fit (minimizing `capacity - item`) is good, sometimes a slightly looser fit might be beneficial if it leaves a "round" amount of space that's likely to be useful for future items. However, for an online algorithm where decisions are made immediately, a greedy strategy that aims for tight fits is generally preferred.

The reflection mentioned "adjusting sensitivity to residual size for First Fit, favoring tighter fits to minimize bins and waste." The current `priority_v1` does exactly this. Maybe the "sensitivity" part implies a more nuanced scoring?

Let's consider a scenario:
Bins: [5, 10]
Item: 3

v1 would prioritize bin 0 (remaining 5) over bin 1 (remaining 10).
Priority for bin 0: max_cap+item - 5
Priority for bin 1: max_cap+item - 10

This prioritizes bin 0, which is the Best Fit.

What if we want to slightly penalize bins that are *too* small, even if they fit? For example, if the remaining capacity is `c`, and the item is `i`, the leftover space is `c - i`.
If `c - i` is very small (e.g., 0 or 1), it might be "too tight."
If `c - i` is very large, it's also not ideal.
We want `c - i` to be small but not *too* small. This suggests a function that is minimized when `c - i` is small.

Consider a penalty function that is `(c - i)^2` for bins that fit. We want to *minimize* this penalty, so we'd take the negative of it for our priority score.

Let's try: `priority = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)^2` for bins that fit.
Bins: [5, 10]
Item: 3
Bin 0: remaining 5. Score = -(5 - 3)^2 = -(2)^2 = -4
Bin 1: remaining 10. Score = -(10 - 3)^2 = -(7)^2 = -49

This prioritizes bin 0 (less negative score). This is consistent with Best Fit.

What if we want to favor bins that are "just right"?
Consider a function that peaks when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is some ideal value, say `k`.
For example, if `k=0` (perfect fit), we want maximum priority.
If `k` is very small or very large, the priority should decrease.
A Gaussian-like function could work, but it requires estimating an "ideal" leftover capacity, which is hard in an online setting.

The reflection "adjusting sensitivity to residual size" and "favoring tighter fits to minimize bins and waste" still strongly points towards a Best Fit variant. The existing `priority_v1` already does this by prioritizing smaller `bins_remain_cap` that can fit the item.

Let's consider the phrasing: "Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity *after* packing." This is precisely Best Fit.
`priority = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` for bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`.
This is equivalent to `priority = item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
We want to *maximize* this, so the smallest `bins_remain_cap[i]` that fits will get the highest priority.

The `priority_v1` implementation: `max_possible_capacity - fitting_bins_capacities`
Let `M = max_possible_capacity`.
Priority for bin `i` with remaining capacity `c_i` (where `c_i >= item`): `M - c_i`.
Maximizing `M - c_i` is equivalent to minimizing `c_i`. This is indeed First Fit (and also Best Fit in terms of remaining capacity *before* packing).

Let's reinterpret "Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity *after* packing". This means we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
So, for bins that fit, the priority should be `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
We want to maximize this.

Let's try this "Best Fit" interpretation for `priority_v2`.

`priority = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` for bins that fit.
Let `best_fit_score = item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
To ensure these scores are generally higher than the default -1, we can add a large constant.
`priority = large_constant + item - bins_remain_cap[i]` for bins that fit.

Let's test with an example.
`bins_remain_cap = np.array([5.0, 3.0, 7.0])`
`item = 2.0`

v1:
`can_fit_mask = [True, True, True]`
`fitting_bins_capacities = [5.0, 3.0, 7.0]`
`max_possible_capacity = 7.0 + 2.0 = 9.0` (using max of original array for estimation)
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = 9.0 - [5.0, 3.0, 7.0] = [4.0, 6.0, 2.0]`
v1 output: `[4.0, 6.0, 2.0]`
Bin with remaining 3.0 gets highest priority.

v2 (Best Fit):
`can_fit_mask = [True, True, True]`
`fitting_bins_capacities = [5.0, 3.0, 7.0]`
Wastage:
Bin 0: `5.0 - 2.0 = 3.0`
Bin 1: `3.0 - 2.0 = 1.0`
Bin 2: `7.0 - 2.0 = 5.0`
We want to minimize wastage. Bin 1 has minimal wastage.
Priority based on `-(wastage)`:
Bin 0: `-3.0`
Bin 1: `-1.0`
Bin 2: `-5.0`
Highest priority is for Bin 1.

To make it comparable to v1 (higher is better), we can use `max_wastage - wastage`.
Max wastage = 5.0
Bin 0: `5.0 - 3.0 = 2.0`
Bin 1: `5.0 - 1.0 = 4.0`
Bin 2: `5.0 - 5.0 = 0.0`
This prioritizes Bin 1.

So, the scoring function for bins that fit should be: `K - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`, where `K` is a constant chosen to make priorities higher than -1. A good `K` would be the maximum possible wastage, or simply a large number.
Let's use `K = max(bins_remain_cap)`. This isn't quite right as `max(bins_remain_cap)` could be smaller than `item`.
Let's use `K = max(bins_remain_cap) + item` which is roughly the maximum possible remaining capacity.
Or simply, `K = some_large_constant`.

Let's use the logic: `priority = (max_possible_value) - (value_to_minimize)`.
The value to minimize is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` (wastage).
Let's pick a `max_possible_value` that is larger than any possible wastage.
A safe bet is `max(bins_remain_cap)` plus `item` (which could be `max(bins_remain_cap) + item - 0`).
So, let's use `max(bins_remain_cap)` as a baseline for `K`.

Consider `priority = (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`. We want to minimize this, so higher priority = smaller value.
The current v1 does `max_val - c_i`, which prioritizes smaller `c_i`.
This is First Fit.

The reflection asks for "minimal remaining capacity *after* packing", which is `c_i - item`.
So we want to prioritize bins where `c_i - item` is minimal.
This means `priority` should be proportional to `-(c_i - item)`.
Or, `priority = C - (c_i - item)` for some constant `C`.
Let's choose `C = max(bins_remain_cap)`.

So, for bins that fit: `priority = max(bins_remain_cap) - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`
This simplifies to `priority = max(bins_remain_cap) + item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
This is exactly the same as `priority_v1`'s calculation if `max_possible_capacity` is chosen as `max(bins_remain_cap) + item`.

The reflection might be hinting at a "most tolerant" or "least wasteful" approach.
What if we use the ratio of item size to remaining capacity?
Or the ratio of remaining capacity to item size?

Let's stick to the interpretation of "minimal remaining capacity after packing." This is a clear Best Fit heuristic.
The score should be higher for bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is smaller.
So, `priority = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
To ensure scores are generally positive and larger than -1, we can use `large_constant + item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
Let `large_constant` be the maximum possible value of `bins_remain_cap[i]`. This guarantees `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is not excessively negative.
Or, more simply, we can use `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` and sort them in ascending order. For a priority score where higher is better, we can use the negative of this value, scaled and shifted.

Let's define the priority for fitting bins as: `priorities[i] = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`
To ensure these are greater than -1, we can add a large constant, e.g., `np.max(bins_remain_cap)`.
So, `priorities[i] = np.max(bins_remain_cap) - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
This is `np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.

Let's use `max_remaining_cap_overall = np.max(bins_remain_cap)` as the reference.
The score for a fitting bin `i` will be `max_remaining_cap_overall - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.

Example: `bins_remain_cap = [5.0, 3.0, 7.0]`, `item = 2.0`
`max_remaining_cap_overall = 7.0`
Bin 0 (rem=5): Score = `7.0 - (5.0 - 2.0)` = `7.0 - 3.0` = `4.0`
Bin 1 (rem=3): Score = `7.0 - (3.0 - 2.0)` = `7.0 - 1.0` = `6.0`
Bin 2 (rem=7): Score = `7.0 - (7.0 - 2.0)` = `7.0 - 5.0` = `2.0`
Priorities: `[4.0, 6.0, 2.0]`. This prioritizes bin 1, which has the minimal remaining capacity (3.0) among fitting bins.

This seems to correctly implement the "minimize remaining capacity after packing" strategy.

```
The logic `max_current_cap - (fitting_bins_capacities - item)` is equivalent to `max_current_cap + item - fitting_bins_capacities`. This prioritizes bins with smaller `fitting_bins_capacities`, which is First Fit.

The reflection clearly states "Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity *after* packing."
This means we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.

Let's rename the function to `priority_best_fit` to be clear.
The prompt asks for `priority_v2`.

If we want to minimize `X = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`, then a higher priority corresponds to a smaller `X`.
So, `priority = -X = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item) = item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
To make scores positive and higher than -1, we can add a constant.
Let's use `np.max(bins_remain_cap)`.

`priority = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item - bins_remain_cap[i]` for fitting bins.

Wait, this is exactly the same as the `priority_v1` formulation if `max_possible_capacity` is `np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item`.
`max_possible_capacity - fitting_bins_capacities` becomes `(np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item) - fitting_bins_capacities`.
This prioritizes smaller `fitting_bins_capacities`.

Let's re-read the reflection: "Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing. Explore adjusting sensitivity to residual size for First Fit, favoring tighter fits to minimize bins and waste."

The "favoring tighter fits to minimize bins and waste" is what both First Fit and Best Fit aim for.
The key is "minimal remaining capacity after packing."

Best Fit: minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
The priority score should be inversely proportional to `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
Let's map `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` to a priority score where smaller is better.
For example, if `bins_remain_cap = [5, 3, 7]` and `item = 2`:
Wastage: `[3, 1, 5]`.
We want bin 1 (wastage 1) to have the highest priority.

Let's use the *inverse* of wastage as a proxy for priority (higher is better).
However, wastage can be zero. Inverse of zero is infinity.
So, we can use `1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon)` or `C - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.

Let's use the `C - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` formulation.
If `C = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item`, then `priority = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
This is `np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 2*item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
This still prioritizes smaller `bins_remain_cap[i]`.

What if the reflection meant a "Most Tolerant" strategy?
This would prioritize bins that have *just enough* capacity, perhaps penalizing bins that are much larger.
But "minimal remaining capacity after packing" is Best Fit.

Let's try `priority = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`
To ensure scores are higher than -1, we can add a constant. The maximum possible value of `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` can be `max(bins_remain_cap)`.
So, if we want to map a range `[min_wastage, max_wastage]` to `[high_priority, low_priority]`, we can do `max_priority_score - (current_wastage - min_wastage)`.

Let's use a simple mapping for Best Fit:
For bins that fit, `priority = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
We want to make these scores positive and higher than -1.
Let `max_res_cap = np.max(bins_remain_cap)` if bins_remain_cap is not empty, else 0.
Let `max_wastage_possible = max_res_cap`.
The value `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` can range from 0 up to `max_res_cap - item`.
The range of `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` is `-(max_res_cap - item)` to `0`.
To shift this to be positive, add `max_res_cap`.
So, `priority = max_res_cap + item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.

This is indeed the same logic as v1 if `max_possible_capacity` is set appropriately.
The difference might be in how `max_possible_capacity` is determined.
In `v1`, it's `np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item`.
In `v2`, if we use `np.max(bins_remain_cap)`, it's slightly different.

Let's try to implement "minimize remaining capacity after packing" directly.
We want to MINIMIZE `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
So, if `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is smaller, the priority is HIGHER.
Let's use `priority = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` as the core idea.
To scale it, let's find the maximum possible value for `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
This happens when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimum, which is 0 (perfect fit).
So max priority value is `0`.
The minimum value is `-(max(bins_remain_cap) - item)`.

We want to map these to higher numbers.
Let's use `priority = K - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
If `K = np.max(bins_remain_cap)`, then for fitting bins:
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = np.max(bins_remain_cap) - (fitting_bins_capacities - item)`

This is what I wrote in the code above. Let's verify its behavior.
`bins_remain_cap = [5.0, 3.0, 7.0]`, `item = 2.0`
`can_fit_mask = [T, T, T]`, `fitting_bins_capacities = [5.0, 3.0, 7.0]`
`np.max(bins_remain_cap) = 7.0`
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = 7.0 - ([5.0, 3.0, 7.0] - 2.0)`
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = 7.0 - [3.0, 1.0, 5.0]`
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = [4.0, 6.0, 2.0]`
This prioritizes the bin with remaining capacity 3.0. This is Best Fit.

Now, what if `item = 6.0`?
`bins_remain_cap = [5.0, 3.0, 7.0]`, `item = 6.0`
`can_fit_mask = [F, F, T]`, `fitting_bins_capacities = [7.0]`
`np.max(bins_remain_cap) = 7.0`
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = 7.0 - (7.0 - 6.0)`
`priorities[can_fit_mask] = 7.0 - 1.0 = 6.0`
The result is `[-1.0, -1.0, 6.0]`. This correctly prioritizes bin 2.

The reflection also says: "Explore adjusting sensitivity to residual size for First Fit, favoring tighter fits to minimize bins and waste."
This suggests that maybe `v1` is already good, but can be *tuned*.
If `v1` uses `max_capacity - remaining_capacity`, it favors smaller `remaining_capacity`.
This is "tighter fits".

What if "adjusting sensitivity" means making it more or less aggressive about tight fits?
Perhaps by using `(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)^p` where `p` controls sensitivity?
If `p=1`, it's linear. If `p=2`, it penalizes larger leftovers more.

Let's try to implement a "Best Fit" strategy as described by "minimal remaining capacity after packing".

        # `C = np.max(bins_remain_cap)` seems to be the simplest approach.
        
        max_current_cap = np.max(bins_remain_cap) if bins_remain_cap.size > 0 else 0
        
        # The priority score for fitting bins is `max_current_cap - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
        # This is equivalent to `max_current_cap + item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
        # This means smaller `bins_remain_cap[i]` values get higher priority.
        # This is First Fit, not Best Fit.

        # For Best Fit, we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
        # So, higher priority for smaller `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
        # Let's define score as `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` and then scale it.
        # Score = `-(leftover_capacities)`.
        # We want to map `leftover_capacities` to priority scores.
        # `priority = (max_possible_leftover - leftover_capacity)` would work if we knew max possible leftover.
        # A more robust way for Best Fit is to directly use `item - bins_remain_cap[i]` but inverted.
        # No, that's First Fit.

        # Let's use the penalty formulation: we want to minimize `(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)^2`.
        # Priority = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)^2
        # This will penalize larger differences more heavily.
        
        # Let's try the simple Best Fit interpretation: minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
        # Priority = `C - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
        # Let C be a value larger than any possible `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
        # Let `C = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item`.
        # `priority = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item - (fitting_bins_capacities - item)`
        # `priority = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 2*item - fitting_bins_capacities`
        # This still prioritizes smaller `fitting_bins_capacities`.

        # The reflection "Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing"
        # means we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
        # So, the priority should be proportional to `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
        # Let's use `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` and then reverse the order.
        # `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` values for fitting bins.
        # Let's call these `waste_values`. We want to select the bin with minimum `waste_value`.
        # For a priority score where higher is better, we can do `max(waste_values) - waste_value`.

        max_waste_value = np.max(leftover_capacities)
        priorities[can_fit_mask] = max_waste_value - leftover_capacities
