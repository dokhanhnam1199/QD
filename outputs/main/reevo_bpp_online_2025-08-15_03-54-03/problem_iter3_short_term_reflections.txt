Prioritize bins that fit well. Favor smaller remaining capacity for First Fit.
Consider the goal: minimize bins. Prioritize tighter fits for potentially better packing.
Prioritize bins with minimal positive remaining capacity. Adjust sensitivity to residual size.
Prioritize minimizing remaining capacity after packing.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity that fit the item.
Focus on exact fits and then best fits. Exploration is less critical for BPP.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity *after* packing.
Prioritize bins with less remaining capacity. Use sigmoid on fill ratio for a smoother approach.
Prioritize bins that minimize waste *after* packing.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after fitting the item.
