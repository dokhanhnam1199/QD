[Prior reflection]
The current priority function for First Fit (FF) prioritizes bins by their remaining capacity, selecting the first bin that can fit the item. This is implicitly handled by assigning higher priority to bins with less remaining capacity. However, this doesn't directly aim to minimize waste or create tighter fits explicitly.

To improve, we can introduce a bias towards bins that, after placing the item, will have a *very small* remaining capacity. This encourages tighter fits. One way to do this is to make the priority score a non-linear function of the remaining capacity, for example, by squaring the difference `(bin_remain_cap - item)`. A bin that results in a very small remaining capacity (close to zero) will have a much higher priority than a bin that results in a moderately small remaining capacity.

Consider a scenario:
Bin A: remaining_cap = 5
Bin B: remaining_cap = 10
Item: size = 4

FF would pick Bin A.
Priority_v1 might assign:
Bin A: max_cap - 5
Bin B: max_cap - 10
(Bin A has higher priority)

Priority_v2 goal: If placing the item in Bin A leaves a very small residual (e.g., 1), and placing it in Bin B leaves a larger residual (e.g., 6), we want to heavily favor Bin A.

A scoring function like `1 / (bin_remain_cap - item + epsilon)` could work, but might be sensitive to small values.
Alternatively, we can reward small residuals. A function like `-(bin_remain_cap - item)**2` would strongly penalize larger residuals. Or, conversely, `(bin_remain_cap - item)` if we want to favor smaller residuals (but this is essentially what FF does with its ordering).

Let's try a strategy that prioritizes bins that leave the *smallest possible residual* after packing. This means we want `bin_remain_cap - item` to be as close to 0 as possible.

The function `priority_v1` already prioritizes smaller `bins_remain_cap` among those that fit. To encourage tighter fits, we can modify the scoring. Instead of `max_possible_capacity - fitting_bins_capacities`, which rewards *any* smaller remaining capacity, we can directly reward being *close* to the item's size.

A possible approach: assign a high priority to bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small.
Let's use `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)` for bins that fit, to strongly favor minimal remainders.
The epsilon is important to avoid division by zero.

Example:
Item = 3
Bin capacities: [5, 7, 10]

FF would pick bin 1 (capacity 5). Residual = 2.
Bin 2 (capacity 7). Residual = 4.
Bin 3 (capacity 10). Residual = 7.

priority_v1:
Assuming max_cap = 10, item = 3
can_fit_mask = [True, True, True]
fitting_bins_capacities = [5, 7, 10]
max_possible_capacity = 10 + 3 = 13
priorities[can_fit_mask] = 13 - [5, 7, 10] = [8, 6, 3]
Bin 1 has highest priority (8).

New strategy idea (priority_v2): Prioritize bins that result in the smallest positive residual.
Residuals:
Bin 1: 5 - 3 = 2
Bin 2: 7 - 3 = 4
Bin 3: 10 - 3 = 7

We want to give the highest score to the bin with residual 2.
A score like `1 / (residual + epsilon)` would achieve this.
Bin 1: 1 / (2 + epsilon)
Bin 2: 1 / (4 + epsilon)
Bin 3: 1 / (7 + epsilon)

This seems like a good direction.

Let's refine `priority_v2`.
It should still return -1 for bins that don't fit.
For bins that do fit, the priority should be inversely related to the *residual capacity*.

The residual capacity is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
We want to maximize `1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon)`.
A small epsilon like `1e-9` should be sufficient.

Consider edge cases:
- Item larger than bin capacity: handled by `can_fit_mask`.
- Multiple bins with the same minimal residual: the ordering in `bins_remain_cap` will determine which one gets the absolute highest score if they all have the same minimal residual. This is acceptable for heuristic behavior.

The implementation will involve:
1. Identify fitting bins.
2. Calculate residuals for fitting bins: `residuals = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`.
3. Calculate priorities: `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (residuals + epsilon)`.
4. Ensure scores are floats.

Let's think about the "prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing" part of the reflection. This is precisely what `1 / (residual + epsilon)` does. It strongly favors bins where `residual` is close to zero.

Final check on the logic:
- If `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`, priority is -1.
- If `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:
    - Residual = `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`
    - Priority = `1.0 / (residual + epsilon)`
This means:
    - If residual is 0 (perfect fit), priority is `1.0 / epsilon` (very high).
    - If residual is small (e.g., 1), priority is `1.0 / (1 + epsilon)` (high).
    - If residual is large (e.g., 10), priority is `1.0 / (10 + epsilon)` (lower).

This aligns with the goal of finding tighter fits.

One consideration: what if `bins_remain_cap` contains values much smaller than `item` but still positive?
E.g., `bins_remain_cap = [0.5, 5.0]`, `item = 1.0`.
Bin 0: doesn't fit, priority -1.
Bin 1: fits. Residual = 4.0. Priority = `1.0 / (4.0 + epsilon)`.

The current logic seems robust.

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin, favoring tighter fits.

    This strategy prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and, among those,
    favors bins that will have the smallest remaining capacity after packing.
    This encourages "tighter" fits, potentially leading to better packing.

    Args:

        A higher score indicates a higher priority. Bins that cannot fit the
        item are given a score of -1. Bins that can fit the item are scored

        strongly favoring minimal remainders.
