Okay, I'll refine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design.

Here's a redesigned reflection emphasizing actionable strategies and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor analysis, adaptive thresholds, hyperparameter tuning, weighted combinations.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by integrating multiple relevant factors (not just waste/overflow). Dynamically adjust behavior using thresholds and adaptive strategies based on problem state.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on simplistic ratios or single-factor optimization. Neglecting the integration of adaptive mechanisms that respond to changing conditions.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics combine diverse factors with adaptive mechanisms controlled by hyperparameters. Experimentation and tuning are crucial for performance.
