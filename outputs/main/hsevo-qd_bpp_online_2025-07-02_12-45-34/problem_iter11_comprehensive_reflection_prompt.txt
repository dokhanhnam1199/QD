{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with basic factors like waste and overflow, then incrementally add complexity by considering fullness, diversity, and adaptive strategies. Introduce hyperparameters to tune the influence of each factor and adapt the heuristic to different scenarios. Adaptive strategies are crucial.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and use explicit rules to handle different cases. Experiment with weighting different factors and using thresholds to trigger different behaviors. Encapsulation of those rules into some hyper-parameters improves generalizability of the heuristic.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize minimizing waste and overflow explicitly. Consider using different strategies for items that fit and those that don't. Avoid relying solely on ratios, which can be less informative about the actual packing efficiency.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors beyond simple ratios or differences. Adaptive strategies that adjust behavior based on item size or bin capacity can improve performance. Adding bonuses to incentivize desired outcomes, like full bins or perfect fits, can further refine the heuristic.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
