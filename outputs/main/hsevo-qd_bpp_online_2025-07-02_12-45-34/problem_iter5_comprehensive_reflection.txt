Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focused on designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection," and designed to inspire practical ideas:

*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptive, Incentivize, Contextual.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that are sensitive to *context*. Adapt strategies based on item characteristics (size, shape) and bin state (remaining capacity, fill level).

*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simplistic, static rules or universal application of a single strategy.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should dynamically adjust their behavior based on the specific problem instance. Look for opportunities to reward desirable outcomes like full bins.
