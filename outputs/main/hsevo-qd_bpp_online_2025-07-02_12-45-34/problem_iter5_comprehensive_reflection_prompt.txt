{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors beyond simple ratios or differences. Adaptive strategies that adjust behavior based on item size or bin capacity can improve performance. Adding bonuses to incentivize desired outcomes, like full bins or perfect fits, can further refine the heuristic.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize minimizing waste and overflow explicitly. Consider using different strategies for items that fit and those that don't. Avoid relying solely on ratios, which can be less informative about the actual packing efficiency.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
