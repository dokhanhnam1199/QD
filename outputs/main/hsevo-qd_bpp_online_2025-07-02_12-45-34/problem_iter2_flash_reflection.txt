**Analysis:**
Comparing the best (1st) vs the worst (20th), we see the best prioritizes minimizing waste within bins and overflow outside bins, while the worst focuses on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity using a log scale. The better heuristics explicitly handle cases where the item fits and doesn't fit, while the worst just calculates ratios. All versions from 1st to 10th are identical. Versions from 11th to 20th are identical and significantly worse. Overall: the better heuristics have a structured approach that directly addresses the bin packing constraints by trying to fit items efficiently, and penalizing overflow, while the worse heuristics use a more abstract ratio-based approach.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize minimizing waste and overflow explicitly. Consider using different strategies for items that fit and those that don't. Avoid relying solely on ratios, which can be less informative about the actual packing efficiency.
