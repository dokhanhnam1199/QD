Okay, let's redefine self-reflection for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, contextual, incremental, hyperparameter tuning, multi-objective, problem characteristics, trade-offs, diversification.
*   **Advice:** Systematically build complexity by adding relevant factors one at a time and by introducing adaptive parameters. Prioritize adaptability to system state. Explicitly account for trade-offs by considering penalties/bonuses for each objective.
*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simple ratios, premature complexity, ignoring problem-specific context, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristic design should be an iterative process, moving from simple to complex, driven by data, and always aware of the specific problem characteristics to ensure adaptability and effectiveness.
