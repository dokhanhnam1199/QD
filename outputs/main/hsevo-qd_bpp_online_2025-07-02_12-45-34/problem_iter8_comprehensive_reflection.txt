Okay, let's refine the concept of self-reflection for heuristic design, steering clear of the pitfalls mentioned.

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, adaptive, explicit rules, hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that combine diverse factors, use explicit conditional rules, and are adaptable to problem characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simple ratios or static strategies. Don't neglect adaptive behavior.
*   **Explanation:** Successful heuristics often integrate various problem-specific factors, employ clear rules, and adjust behavior dynamically using tunable hyperparameters, offering improved generalizability.
