**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of factors like fit reward, overflow penalty, fullness bonus, close fit boost, empty bin penalty, diversity bonus and item size penalty and adaptively adjusts the weights of these factors based on the item size, while the worst heuristic simply calculates the log of the ratio of item size to bin capacity. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see more sophisticated hyperparameters, adaptively adjusted based on item size relative to bin capacities. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the second heuristic adds consideration of `min_cap` and `fragmentation_penalty` along with adaptive adjustments based on ratios `item_ratio_max`, `item_ratio_avg`, and `item_ratio_min`, while the top heuristic focuses on raw item size relative to `max_cap`. (3rd) vs (4th) are functionally identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst attempts to create a priority based on a negative log ratios. Overall: The better heuristics involve more nuanced combinations of factors and adaptive weighting schemes. They consider the interplay between item size and bin capacities and have multiple tunable hyperparameters. Simpler heuristics rely on only one or two factors. Also, using constants as hyperparameters and tuning them carefully can lead to better performance than hardcoding the values.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with a combination of relevant factors and adaptive weights, tuning the weights based on problem-specific parameters. Consider edge cases and interactions between factors, using a diverse set of metrics (min, max, avg, std) to make the heuristics more robust.
