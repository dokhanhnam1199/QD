Okay, I understand! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to focus on effective strategies for designing bin packing heuristics, avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Waste minimization, overflow handling, item-specific strategies, context-aware packing.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that actively minimize empty space within bins and prevent exceeding bin capacity. Tailor packing approaches based on item size/shape relative to bin dimensions.
*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simplistic ratios or static rules without considering dynamic packing context.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on understanding *why* an item fits (or doesn't) and adapt packing decisions accordingly for optimal space utilization.
