Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding ineffective approaches. Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Problem understanding, incremental complexity, factor interactions, adaptive weighting, hyperparameter optimization, performance evaluation, robustness, generalizability.
*   **Advice:** Ground heuristics in a thorough problem understanding. Systematically introduce complexity, analyze factor interactions, and use adaptive weighting. Rigorously test performance and optimize hyperparameters.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on simple ratios or single factors. Neglecting factor interactions. Insufficiently addressing edge cases. Prematurely optimizing without solid understanding.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a deep understanding of the problem, are built incrementally, are tested in a variety of scenarios, and are fine-tuned with hyperparameters. Avoid simplistic approaches and focus on adaptive strategies.
