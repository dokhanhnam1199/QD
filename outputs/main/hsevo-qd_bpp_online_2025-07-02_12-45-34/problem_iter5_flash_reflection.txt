**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers waste and overflow using `1 / (waste + 0.000001)` for fitting items and `- (item - bins_remain_cap) / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 0.000001)` for overflowing items, while the worst one simply uses `-np.log(item / bins_remain_cap)`. The best heuristic prioritizes minimizing waste when the item fits and minimizing overflow when it doesn't, but the worst only considers ratios. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) follows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the second best heuristic adds sophistication by incorporating a fill ratio, adjusting priority based on item size and bin capacity via thresholding, and providing bonuses for near-perfect fits, suggesting a more refined approach to bin packing. The best only considers simple waste and overflow calculations. Comparing (4th) vs (5th), we observe the 4th heuristic adds a bonus for bins that are already relatively full, scaled by a `fullness` factor. Overall: Better heuristics incorporate nuanced strategies like fill ratio considerations, adaptive prioritization based on item size, and bonuses for desirable outcomes (e.g., near-perfect fits, fuller bins). Worse heuristics rely on simple calculations (like log ratios) without considering the nuances of bin packing.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors beyond simple ratios or differences. Adaptive strategies that adjust behavior based on item size or bin capacity can improve performance. Adding bonuses to incentivize desired outcomes, like full bins or perfect fits, can further refine the heuristic.
