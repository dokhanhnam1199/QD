Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" aimed at improving heuristic design, specifically addressing the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted, adaptive, incremental refinement, hyperparameter tuning, problem-specific context, synergy, bias awareness.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that combine multiple relevant factors (not just waste/overflow), dynamically adjusted based on the *specific* problem context and stage of the solution. Favor synergy between factors.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on simple ratios or single factors. Prematurely complex models. Blind hyperparameter tuning without understanding their impact.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should evolve incrementally, adding complexity thoughtfully. Recognize inherent biases in chosen factors and address them proactively. Focus on designing systems that learn and adapt *within* the constraints of the problem.
