**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st heuristic incorporates significantly more factors into its priority calculation, including adaptive weighting, fullness bonus, close-fit boost, empty bin penalty, item size penalty, diversity consideration, and capacity standard deviation penalty, whereas the 20th only considers ratios of item size to bin capacity.
(2nd best) vs (second worst): The 2nd heuristic is similar to the first, with most factors except bin size penalty. The second worst considers item size to bin capacity ratio, which may lead to faster calculation but ignores many bin properties.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic utilizes scenario-specific adjustments to the weights based on item size, while the second does not change anything compare to the first.
(3rd) vs (4th): These two heuristics are almost identical.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst uses a log function, which will lead to negative values. It only considers the ratio between the item and bin sizes, while the worst-performing uses some hardcoded constants which is more likely to be unoptimized.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a wider range of factors and adaptive strategies, while the worse heuristics focus on fewer factors or use less sophisticated methods. The use of adaptive weighting based on item size is a key differentiator for the best-performing heuristics. Also, penalties for bad fits and bonuses for good fits improved the models.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating diverse factors relevant to the problem. Adaptive weighting based on problem characteristics can significantly improve performance. Penalties and bonuses for appropriate actions may help.
