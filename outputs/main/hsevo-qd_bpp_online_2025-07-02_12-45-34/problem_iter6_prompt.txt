Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate waste if item is placed in each bin\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Give high priority to bins where item fits and waste is minimized\n    fit_mask = waste >= 0\n    priorities[fit_mask] = 1 / (waste[fit_mask] + 0.000001)  # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero\n\n    # Give slightly lower priority to bins where item doesn't fit, but the overflow is minimized\n    # This encourages splitting items across bins less often but still allows it when needed\n    overflow_mask = ~fit_mask\n    priorities[overflow_mask] = - (item - bins_remain_cap[overflow_mask]) / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 0.000001) #Prioritize bins closer to fitting the item\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, here's a redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\" focused on designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection,\" and designed to inspire practical ideas:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptive, Incentivize, Contextual.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that are sensitive to *context*. Adapt strategies based on item characteristics (size, shape) and bin state (remaining capacity, fill level).\n\n*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simplistic, static rules or universal application of a single strategy.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should dynamically adjust their behavior based on the specific problem instance. Look for opportunities to reward desirable outcomes like full bins.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
