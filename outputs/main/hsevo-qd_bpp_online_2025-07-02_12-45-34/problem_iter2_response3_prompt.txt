Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate waste if item is placed in each bin\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Give high priority to bins where item fits and waste is minimized\n    fit_mask = waste >= 0\n    priorities[fit_mask] = 1 / (waste[fit_mask] + 0.000001)  # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero\n\n    # Give slightly lower priority to bins where item doesn't fit, but the overflow is minimized\n    # This encourages splitting items across bins less often but still allows it when needed\n    overflow_mask = ~fit_mask\n    priorities[overflow_mask] = - (item - bins_remain_cap[overflow_mask]) / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 0.000001) #Prioritize bins closer to fitting the item\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    ratios = item / bins_remain_cap\n    log_ratios = np.log(ratios)\n    priorities = -log_ratios\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best (1st) vs the worst (20th), we see the best prioritizes minimizing waste within bins and overflow outside bins, while the worst focuses on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity using a log scale. The better heuristics explicitly handle cases where the item fits and doesn't fit, while the worst just calculates ratios. All versions from 1st to 10th are identical. Versions from 11th to 20th are identical and significantly worse. Overall: the better heuristics have a structured approach that directly addresses the bin packing constraints by trying to fit items efficiently, and penalizing overflow, while the worse heuristics use a more abstract ratio-based approach.\n- \nOkay, I understand! Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to focus on effective strategies for designing bin packing heuristics, avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Waste minimization, overflow handling, item-specific strategies, context-aware packing.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that actively minimize empty space within bins and prevent exceeding bin capacity. Tailor packing approaches based on item size/shape relative to bin dimensions.\n*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simplistic ratios or static rules without considering dynamic packing context.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on understanding *why* an item fits (or doesn't) and adapt packing decisions accordingly for optimal space utilization.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
