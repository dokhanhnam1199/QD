**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates several factors like waste, overflow, fullness, adaptive empty bin handling, item size relative to bin size penalty, bin diversity consideration, and capacity standard deviation penalty, while the worst only considers the log of the ratio between item size and bin capacity. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (1st) vs (4th), we see that the best heuristic includes a penalty related to capacity standard deviation and item size relative to bin size, which are not present in (4th). (9th) introduces tunable parameters and explicitly addresses fit and overflow scenarios, including bonuses for best fit and near-full bins. (10th) simplifies the parameterization, using fixed values. Comparing (10th) and (12th), we see (10th) incorporates bonuses for best fit, near-full bins, and minimizing overflow (when no fit is possible), whereas (12th) simply gives priority to bins where the item fits and penalizes overflow. Comparing (12th) and (15th), we see (15th) is an enhancement on (12th) as it incentivizes filling bins that are already relatively full. Comparing (15th) and (20th), (15th) takes waste, overflow, and fill level into account, while (20th) just calculates `log_ratios`. Comparing (1st) and (9th), (1st) introduces several new parameters. (9th) introduces `fit_priority_increase`, `best_fit_bonus`, `near_full_threshold`, `near_full_bonus`, and `least_overflow_bonus`. Comparing (11th) and (12th), (11th) introduces `fit_priority_scale`, `waste_epsilon`, `overflow_priority_scale`, and `max_cap_epsilon`. Overall: the better heuristics are much more complex, taking into account more factors and edge cases, whereas the worse heuristics are simpler, and only account for the most obvious of factors. Better heuristics also use hyperparameters, as compared to worse heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with simple approaches and incrementally add complexity by considering different factors (e.g., waste, overflow, fullness) and edge cases. Hyperparameters enhance adaptability, but require careful tuning. A balance between complexity and performance is crucial.
