Okay, let's redefine self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls. Here's a breakdown to guide your process:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive tuning, factor weighting, multi-faceted, scenario-specific, incremental refinement.
*   **Advice:** Build heuristics that adapt to specific problem scenarios by weighting relevant factors and tuning these weights adaptively. Refine heuristically incrementally, testing the impact of each addition.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on simple metrics (e.g., ratios), neglecting problem-specific characteristics, and static/inflexible designs.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are context-aware. Don't just minimize waste, understand *why* waste occurs and tailor your approach accordingly with adaptive weights and tuning.
