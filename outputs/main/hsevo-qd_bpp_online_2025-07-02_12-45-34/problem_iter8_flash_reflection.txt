Okay, I'm ready to analyze the heuristics and provide guidance for designing better ones.

**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates several factors like waste minimization, best fit improvement, reward for near-full bins, overflow handling, and bin balancing, while the worst heuristic simply uses the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) show a similar contrast.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first heuristic has more explicit control over several rules that involve fitting heuristic, best fit improvement, reward near-full bins, overflow heuristic, bin balancing, while the second heuristic encapsulates a similar idea into some constants such as `fit_priority_scale`, `waste_epsilon`, `overflow_penalty_scale`, `max_cap_epsilon`.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), 3rd one uses some constant to weight the overflow and waste of bins, while 4th one uses a combination of `fill_ratio`, `large_item_threshold`, negative overflow, `close_fit_mask` to define the priority.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the two heuristics are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics use a combination of factors to calculate priority, including waste, overflow, fill ratio, and bin balancing, and provide explicit rules for different cases such as fitting and overflowing, while the worse heuristics tend to only consider one or two of these factors in a simple calculation. The best heuristics are highly configurable to adapt to problem domain.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and use explicit rules to handle different cases. Experiment with weighting different factors and using thresholds to trigger different behaviors. Encapsulation of those rules into some hyper-parameters improves generalizability of the heuristic.
