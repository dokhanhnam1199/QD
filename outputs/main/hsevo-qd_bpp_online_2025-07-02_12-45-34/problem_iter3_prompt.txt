Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate waste if item is placed in each bin\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Give high priority to bins where item fits and waste is minimized\n    fit_mask = waste >= 0\n    priorities[fit_mask] = 1 / (waste[fit_mask] + 0.000001)  # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero\n\n    # Give slightly lower priority to bins where item doesn't fit, but the overflow is minimized\n    # This encourages splitting items across bins less often but still allows it when needed\n    overflow_mask = ~fit_mask\n    priorities[overflow_mask] = - (item - bins_remain_cap[overflow_mask]) / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 0.000001) #Prioritize bins closer to fitting the item\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, I understand! Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to focus on effective strategies for designing bin packing heuristics, avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Waste minimization, overflow handling, item-specific strategies, context-aware packing.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that actively minimize empty space within bins and prevent exceeding bin capacity. Tailor packing approaches based on item size/shape relative to bin dimensions.\n*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on simplistic ratios or static rules without considering dynamic packing context.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on understanding *why* an item fits (or doesn't) and adapt packing decisions accordingly for optimal space utilization.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
