**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (16th), we see the introduction of adaptive adjustments based on item size relative to max capacity is beneficial. (2nd) vs (20th) reveals the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe the slight variation in hyperparameter values. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see no difference, indicating identical code. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical.

(5th) introduces `min_cap` and `fragmentation_penalty`, along with adjustments based on `item_ratio_avg` and item-aware adjustments.  This shows more sophisticated handling of item size relative to bin capacities. This is an improvement over the earlier heuristics, which primarily focus on `max_cap`.

(6th) incorporates `num_bins` and `total_capacity` to introduce a `capacity_utilization_bonus`. It prioritizes bins based on overall utilization, showing an awareness of the global state, which improves overall bin packing.

(8th) introduces adaptive weighting factors and scenario-specific adjustments based on item size relative to bin sizes. It includes a penalty based on capacity standard deviation, aiming to reduce variance in bin fullness.

(9th) focuses on tuning hyperparameters through manual exploration and intuition and emphasizes a balance between fitting, overflow, and fullness.

Overall: The better heuristics progressively incorporate more factors: adapting weights based on item size, considering global bin utilization, and tuning hyperparameters, while penalizing the capacity standard deviation. The less effective heuristics focus primarily on immediate fit and waste, without considering the broader context of bin utilization and item characteristics. The most successful heuristics use adaptive strategies that adjust weights and penalties based on the item size and bin characteristics.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider adaptive strategies that adjust to item size and overall system state (e.g., bin utilization). Tuned hyperparameters and diverse penalties (fragmentation, standard deviation) can enhance performance. Contextual awareness, beyond immediate fit, is crucial for effective global optimization.
