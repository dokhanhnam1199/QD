**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers waste, overflow, fullness, adaptive empty bin handling and bin diversity while the worst only uses a log ratio. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (1st) and (5th), (1st) includes hyperparameters and adaptive empty bin handling while (5th) does not. Comparing (5th) and (10th), (5th) considers fullness while (10th) does not. Comparing (10th) vs (18th), (10th) considers both fitting and overflowing items while (18th) only considers ratios. The top heuristics include more complex considerations and parameter tuning, while lower ones focus on simpler waste/overflow ratios or even direct ratios. Adding more factors like fullness, diversity, and adaptive strategies improves performance. Overall: The best heuristics combine multiple factors with tunable parameters, while simpler heuristics focusing on ratios perform worse. The best one also is adaptive to item size, and dynamically adjusts penalties.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with basic factors like waste and overflow, then incrementally add complexity by considering fullness, diversity, and adaptive strategies. Introduce hyperparameters to tune the influence of each factor and adapt the heuristic to different scenarios. Adaptive strategies are crucial.
