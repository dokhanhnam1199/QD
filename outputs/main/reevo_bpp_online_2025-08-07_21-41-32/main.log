[2025-08-07 21:43:45,007][root][INFO] - Short-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Compute Worst‑Fit priority for each bin.

    The worst‑fit strategy always places the next item into the bin with
    the *largest* remaining free capacity that is large enough to hold
    the item.  This function returns a score array; the bin with the
    maximum score is chosen for the item.  Bins that cannot accommodate
    the item are given a score of -np.inf, ensuring they are never
    selected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    item : float
        Size of the incoming item.
    bins_remain_cap : np.ndarray
        Remaining capacity of each bin (positive numbers).  Must be 1‑D.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Priority scores of the same shape as `bins_remain_cap`.  The
        highest score corresponds to the bin that should receive the
        item under the worst‑fit policy.
    """
    # Only bins that have enough capacity are considered; others get -inf score
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    priorities[valid] = bins_remain_cap[valid]
    return priorities

[Better code]

    """Random Fit priority for online bin packing.

    Each feasible bin (with enough remaining capacity) receives a random score.
    Infeasible bins receive -inf so they are never selected. This implements a
    pure random fit strategy, optionally biased toward tighter fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of the incoming item.
        bins_remain_cap: 1‑D array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        A 1‑D array of priority scores, one per bin.
    """
    # Ensure capacities are a float array.
    caps = np.asarray(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.
    feasible = caps >= item

    # Initialise all priorities to -inf (so infeasible bins are never chosen).
    priorities = np.full_like(caps, -np.inf, dtype=float)

    # Generate independent random numbers for each bin.
    rand_scores = np.random.rand(caps.size)

    # Bias towards tighter fits: less slack -> larger bias.
    # Small epsilon avoids division by zero for exact fits.
    epsilon = 1e-12
    slack = caps - item
    bias = np.zeros_like(caps)
    bias[feasible] = 1.0 / (slack[feasible] + epsilon)  # higher when slack is small

    # Combine random component with bias.
    # Multiplying emphasizes bins with higher bias while preserving randomness.
    priorities[feasible] = bias[feasible] * rand_scores[feasible]

    return priorities

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

[2025-08-07 21:43:51,526][root][INFO] - Crossover Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Worse code]
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Compute Worst‑Fit priority for each bin.

    The worst‑fit strategy always places the next item into the bin with
    the *largest* remaining free capacity that is large enough to hold
    the item.  This function returns a score array; the bin with the
    maximum score is chosen for the item.  Bins that cannot accommodate
    the item are given a score of -np.inf, ensuring they are never
    selected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    item : float
        Size of the incoming item.
    bins_remain_cap : np.ndarray
        Remaining capacity of each bin (positive numbers).  Must be 1‑D.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Priority scores of the same shape as `bins_remain_cap`.  The
        highest score corresponds to the bin that should receive the
        item under the worst‑fit policy.
    """
    # Only bins that have enough capacity are considered; others get -inf score
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    priorities[valid] = bins_remain_cap[valid]
    return priorities

[Better code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Random Fit priority for online bin packing.

    Each feasible bin (with enough remaining capacity) receives a random score.
    Infeasible bins receive -inf so they are never selected. This implements a
    pure random fit strategy, optionally biased toward tighter fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of the incoming item.
        bins_remain_cap: 1‑D array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        A 1‑D array of priority scores, one per bin.
    """
    # Ensure capacities are a float array.
    caps = np.asarray(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.
    feasible = caps >= item

    # Initialise all priorities to -inf (so infeasible bins are never chosen).
    priorities = np.full_like(caps, -np.inf, dtype=float)

    # Generate independent random numbers for each bin.
    rand_scores = np.random.rand(caps.size)

    # Bias towards tighter fits: less slack -> larger bias.
    # Small epsilon avoids division by zero for exact fits.
    epsilon = 1e-12
    slack = caps - item
    bias = np.zeros_like(caps)
    bias[feasible] = 1.0 / (slack[feasible] + epsilon)  # higher when slack is small

    # Combine random component with bias.
    # Multiplying emphasizes bins with higher bias while preserving randomness.
    priorities[feasible] = bias[feasible] * rand_scores[feasible]

    return priorities

[Reflection]
Blend worst‑fit with slack‑biased randomness; normalize, weight components, add exploration, anticipate future items.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

[2025-08-07 21:44:48,438][root][INFO] - Long-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Blend worst‑fit with slack‑biased randomness; normalize, weight components, add exploration, anticipate future items.
Adapt epsilon, balance best‑fit with exploration, penalize waste, consider bin age, use random tie‑breaking.
Prefer deterministic exact‑fit first, remove random epsilon; add tiny tie‑breaker and floating‑point tolerance for stable priorities.
Use inverse‑waste scoring, assign –inf to infeasible bins, add epsilon for stability, normalize scores to non‑negative.
Score bins by negative leftover; use adaptive penalty; blend best‑fit with worst‑fit; add lookahead.
Blend tight-fit bias with controlled randomness; weight inverse slack, adapt epsilon/boost thresholds dynamically.
Use normalized scores, heavily penalize infeasible bins, add tiny tie‑breaking bias, guard against division‑by‑zero.
Blend residual capacity with random priority; weight feasibility, use stochastic tie‑breakers, and tune randomness distribution.
Softmax over negative waste with temperature; assign zero to infeasible bins; adapt gamma/temperature to balance exploration‑exploitation.
Prioritize near‑full bins with adaptive boost, penalize infeasible, use small noise for ties.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Blend exact‑fit with weighted worst‑fit: normalize inverse waste scores, add tiny epsilon tie‑breakers, penalize waste, adapt temperature, lookahead, account for bin age, guard division‑by‑zero, and keep floating‑point stability.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Random Fit priority for online bin packing.

    Each feasible bin (with enough remaining capacity) receives a random score.
    Infeasible bins receive -inf so they are never selected. This implements a
    pure random fit strategy, optionally biased toward tighter fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of the incoming item.
        bins_remain_cap: 1‑D array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        A 1‑D array of priority scores, one per bin.
    """
    # Ensure capacities are a float array.
    caps = np.asarray(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.
    feasible = caps >= item

    # Initialise all priorities to -inf (so infeasible bins are never chosen).
    priorities = np.full_like(caps, -np.inf, dtype=float)

    # Generate independent random numbers for each bin.
    rand_scores = np.random.rand(caps.size)

    # Bias towards tighter fits: less slack -> larger bias.
    # Small epsilon avoids division by zero for exact fits.
    epsilon = 1e-12
    slack = caps - item
    bias = np.zeros_like(caps)
    bias[feasible] = 1.0 / (slack[feasible] + epsilon)  # higher when slack is small

    # Combine random component with bias.
    # Multiplying emphasizes bins with higher bias while preserving randomness.
    priorities[feasible] = bias[feasible] * rand_scores[feasible]

    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    Priority function for the online Bin Packing Problem.

    For each currently open bin we compute a score; the bin with the highest
    score will receive the incoming item.  The score favours:
      * Feasibility (the bin must have enough remaining capacity).
      * Tight fits (small slack after insertion).
      * A small deterministic tie‑breaker based on the bin index.
      * Random diversification to avoid pathological deterministic behaviour.

    Parameters
    ----------
    item : float
        Size of the incoming item.
    bins_remain_cap : np.ndarray
        1‑D array containing the remaining capacity of each open bin.
    tolerance : float, optional
        Numerical tolerance for feasibility checks (default 1e-12).
    epsilon : float, optional
        Small constant added to slack to avoid division by zero
        (default 1e-12).
    tie_breaker : float, optional
        Weight applied to the bin index to break ties deterministically.
        Must be small enough not to outweigh the main bias (default 1e-12).
    random_state : np.random.Generator, optional
        Random number generator for reproducibility. If ``None`` a new
        default generator is created.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Priority scores for each bin (higher is better). Infeasible bins
        receive ``-np.inf`` (negative infinity) and will never be selected.
