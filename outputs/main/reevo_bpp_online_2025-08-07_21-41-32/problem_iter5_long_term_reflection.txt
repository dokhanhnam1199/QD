Prioritize exact‑fit placements; deterministic tie‑breakers.  
Boost nearly full bins with exponential decay using adaptive epsilon.  
Score = inverse‑waste only; avoid normalisation.  
Add tiny epsilon or deterministic bias for ties.  
Penalise leftover waste; keep scoring linear.  
Skip look‑ahead, age, randomness for speed.  
Guard against division‑by‑zero; ensure floating‑point stability.
