Prioritize exact‑fit bins; score feasible bins by 1/(slack+ε). Use a tiny, reproducible random tie‑breaker seeded per bin. Keep priority simple, avoid heavy normalization; optionally weight by feasible‑bin fraction. Use deterministic index tie‑break as fallback. Vectorize, guard division‑by‑zero, and apply tolerance checks.
