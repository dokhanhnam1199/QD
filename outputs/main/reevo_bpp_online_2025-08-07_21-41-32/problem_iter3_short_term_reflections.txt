Blend worst‑fit with slack‑biased randomness; normalize, weight components, add exploration, anticipate future items.
Adapt epsilon, balance best‑fit with exploration, penalize waste, consider bin age, use random tie‑breaking.
Prefer deterministic exact‑fit first, remove random epsilon; add tiny tie‑breaker and floating‑point tolerance for stable priorities.
Use inverse‑waste scoring, assign –inf to infeasible bins, add epsilon for stability, normalize scores to non‑negative.
Score bins by negative leftover; use adaptive penalty; blend best‑fit with worst‑fit; add lookahead.
Blend tight-fit bias with controlled randomness; weight inverse slack, adapt epsilon/boost thresholds dynamically.
Use normalized scores, heavily penalize infeasible bins, add tiny tie‑breaking bias, guard against division‑by‑zero.
Blend residual capacity with random priority; weight feasibility, use stochastic tie‑breakers, and tune randomness distribution.
Softmax over negative waste with temperature; assign zero to infeasible bins; adapt gamma/temperature to balance exploration‑exploitation.
Prioritize near‑full bins with adaptive boost, penalize infeasible, use small noise for ties.
