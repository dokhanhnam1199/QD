BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nPrioritize exact\u2011fit placements; use deterministic tie\u2011breakers (e.g., bin index). Score by inverse slack (1/(slack+\u03b5)) with adaptive \u03b5 based on current waste. Add tiny random noise only for ties. Keep scoring linear or mild exponential; avoid look\u2011ahead; guard division\u2011by\u2011zero.\n\n[Code]\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Random Fit priority for online bin packing.\n\n    Each feasible bin (with enough remaining capacity) receives a random score.\n    Infeasible bins receive -inf so they are never selected.
