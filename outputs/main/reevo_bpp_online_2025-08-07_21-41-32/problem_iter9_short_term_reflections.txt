Use normalized inverse slack, constant epsilon, vectorized computation, reproducible RNG tie‑breaks, and minimal deterministic penalties.
Use inverse‑slack bias, percentile boosts, adaptive weighting, normalise scores, and tiny random tie‑breakers.
Use deterministic tight‑fit priority, simple index tie‑breaker, avoid random weighting, handle floating errors.
Favor exact fits, deterministic tie‑breakers, adaptive slack weighting, exclude infeasible bins.
Use random scores biased by slack; skip per‑call state and heavy weighting for fast, effective online decisions.
Bias random scores by slack, adapt tolerance, weight bins by fill level, randomize ties for exploration.
Bias random scores by slack, normalize bias, use simple feasibility mask, minimal tie‑breaker, avoid complex adaptive weighting.
Prioritise exact fit, dampen randomness when slack is tiny. Normalise bias. Seed RNG per bin. Add deterministic tie‑breaker.
Bias random scores by inverse slack; avoid percentile boosts, heavy normalization, and extra thresholds for speed.
Combine inverse‑slack bias with random scores; adapt ε to capacity distribution for stability and exploration.
