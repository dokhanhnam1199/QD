Blend exact‑fit scoring with random bias (1/(slack+ε)), use deterministic tie‑breakers, and tune bias adaptively.
Adaptive epsilon, combine inverse‑slack with low‑percentile boost, normalize scores, tiny random tie‑breaker, avoid heavy lookahead.
Prefer exact‑fit, simple linear scoring; avoid exponential scaling and noisy look‑ahead; deterministic tie‑breakers; keep computation cheap.
Exact‑fit first, penalize leftover, deterministic index tie‑break, small tolerance, no random/percentile boosts.
Bias random selection by inverse slack; adapt scaling to current leftovers; keep randomness tiny for tie‑breaking.
Bias random scores by inverse slack, adapt boost scale, keep tie‑breakers tiny, avoid extreme exponentials.
Exact‑fit priority, deterministic tie‑breaker, avoid random factors, simple leftover penalty, tiny index bias for ties.
Use tight‑fit bias with random tie‑breaking; adapt weightings online based on packing statistics.
Prefer a simple leftover‑based exponential boost with adaptive epsilon, add tiny noise, and avoid many weighted components.
Use slack‑based bias, incorporate stochastic tie‑breaking, and adapt bias over time based on bin fill levels.
