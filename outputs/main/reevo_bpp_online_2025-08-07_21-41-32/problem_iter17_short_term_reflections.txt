Remove extra normalisations; use bias = 1/(slack+eps)*feasible_frac; add tiny random noise; epsilon tie‑break.
Normalize bias, use a single RNG, skip redundant scaling, keep tie‑breaker tiny, and fully vectorize operations.
Normalize bias, add tiny random perturbation, weight by feasible fraction, use deterministic tie‑breaker, vectorize, protect against division‑by‑zero.
Normalize once, omit feasible‑fraction scaling; bias × random suffices, tiny index tie‑breaker resolves ties.
Use bias*random for tight fits, skip normalization, keep tie‑breaker tiny, avoid unnecessary fill‑fraction term.
Prioritize tight slack; keep noise tiny; avoid re‑normalization; add a tiny deterministic tie‑breaker; experiment with epsilon values.
Avoid double normalization, use default_rng, calibrate bias vs randomness, keep tie‑breaker tiny, fully vectorize.
Normalize slack, favor tighter fits, weight by feasible‑fraction, add tiny random perturbation, deterministic tie‑breaker.
Normalize slack, weight by feasible‑fraction, add tiny random jitter, deterministic tie‑break, ensure numerical stability.
Vectorize ops, drop extra bias normalization, use reproducible RNG, keep tie‑breaker tiny, early infeasibility exit.
