Weight slack directly; reduce random noise; use index penalty; avoid normalizing by max.
Keep priority calculation simple, add mild bias toward tight fit, avoid heavy normalization, use tie‑breaking, test on diverse instances.
Use random tie‑breaking, bias toward tighter fits, keep priority simple, avoid over‑complex adaptive weighting.
Combine deterministic tie‑breakers, adapt slack weighting by feasibility fraction, normalize slack, and avoid random factors for reproducibility.
Blend exact‑fit scoring, normalized slack bias, bounded randomness, tolerance checks, deterministic tie‑breaker for robust online bin‑packing.
Prefer deterministic tie‑breakers, normalize slack, adapt slack weight by feasible proportion, use tolerance, eliminate randomness.
Bias toward small slack (use 1/(slack+ε)); add random tie‑breaking; avoid complex adaptive weighting.
Bias toward tight fits, add randomness for diversification, adapt bias by slack, use tiny tie‑breakers, fine‑tune epsilon.
Blend random scores with inverse‑slack bias, normalize, weight by feasibility, break ties deterministically.
Bias random scores by inverse slack, adapt weight with feasible‑bin fraction, and add deterministic tie‑breaker.
