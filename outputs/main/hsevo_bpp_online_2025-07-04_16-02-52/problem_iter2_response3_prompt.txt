Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This version prioritizes bins where the item fits, giving preference to bins\n    that would have the least amount of space left over.

A lower 'energy' (more stable state)\n    should have higher priority. This uses a potential energy function related to\n    the remaining space in the bin after placing the item.  We also need to\n    introduce some 'tunneling' probability for bins that are almost full\n    to encourage exploration.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Small constant to avoid division by zero and log of zero\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after placing the item.  Negative values mean item doesn't fit.\n    remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # \"Potential Energy\" function:  higher energy for nearly full or over-full bins\n    potential_energy = np.where(remaining_cap > 0, 1 / (remaining_cap + epsilon), 1e9) # High energy if it overflows\n\n    # \"Tunneling\" effect: even if the bin is almost full, there's a small chance we still consider it, promoting exploration.\n    # A slightly filled bin is prefereable though, according to potential energy.\n    tunneling_probability = np.exp(-np.abs(remaining_cap) * 10)  # Decay fast with more fill\n\n    # Combine potential energy and tunneling: lower energy + some tunneling = higher priority\n    priorities = -potential_energy + tunneling_probability\n    \n    # Ensure we aren't selecting impossible options\n    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, priorities, -1e9)  # Make impossible options super low priority.\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic directly calculates the `min_remaining_cap` among valid bins and prioritizes bins based on their proximity to this minimum, also incorporating a small bonus for bins that are almost full and using numpy operations, leading to a more efficient and potentially better packing strategy. The 20th heuristic uses a \"potential energy\" and \"tunneling\" analogy, which might be less direct and less effective in practice due to the specific formulation of the energy and tunneling terms. Also the 1st heuristic is more concise.\n\nComparing (2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd heuristic prioritizes bins based on the inverse of remaining space and assigns very low priority to bins where the item doesn't fit, using a loop-based approach. The 19th heuristic tries to apply more complex calculations.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses a simpler logic assigning priorities and extra weights to the fit items. The 4th uses the inverse of remaining space.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), the 19th and 20th heuristics are near identical.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics use numpy operations to achieve better efficiency. They calculate remaining capacities and derive priority based on capacity. More complex heuristics do not guarantee better performance.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined concept of \"Current Self-Reflection\" tailored for designing better packing heuristics, steering clear of potential pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Capacity-focused, Computationally Efficient, Adaptive Exploration, Iterative Refinement.\n\n*   **Advice:** Emphasize quick capacity checks, explore simple randomization for diversification, and design for incremental improvement through iterative testing.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex strategies, analogies without clear performance benefits, and premature optimization.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on rapid evaluation and adaptation based on remaining space. Simple, fast heuristics, combined with controlled randomness, allow efficient exploration and iterative refinement through experimentation.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
