{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating a variety of factors beyond the primary objective, such as adaptive penalties and bonuses based on item characteristics and bin states. Also, controlled randomness and diversity measures can improve exploration.\n```\nEffective heuristics require a balanced approach, considering multiple factors such as waste minimization, fill ratio, and exploration. Adaptive parameters, like randomness scaled by item size, can improve performance. Prioritizing a combination of these elements often leads to better solutions than focusing on a single metric.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, efficient calculations using NumPy for speed. Favor simple, direct heuristics based on remaining capacity. Complex analogies may not translate to better packing. Exploration can be achieved with simpler methods such as the inclusion of a random factor in the priorities.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating adaptive parameters that adjust based on item size, bin capacity, and fill levels. Also, add a small amount of randomization for exploration, and penalize empty bins to prevent premature filling of small bins.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
