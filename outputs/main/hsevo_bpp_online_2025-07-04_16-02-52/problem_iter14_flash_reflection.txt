**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both heuristics are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (6th), (9th) vs (10th), (11th) vs (12th), (13th) vs (14th), (15th) vs (16th), (17th) vs (18th), (19th) vs (20th), we also see that both heuristics are identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), we observe several key differences. Heuristic 3 introduces the concept of adaptive scaling and bonus/penalty mechanisms based on item size and bin capacity. These adaptive approaches, specifically the adaptive fill ratio bonus, randomization factor, and bin-emptiness penalty, are not present in Heuristic 1. Additionally, Heuristic 3 includes a bonus for bins nearing full capacity and penalizes bins that are nearly full to encourage diversity.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), Heuristic 4 introduces a non-linear penalty for wasted space, scaling it by the maximum bin capacity, whereas Heuristic 3 uses a linear penalty and normalizes by the max bin capacity. Also, Heuristic 4 scales randomization by the item and bin capacity, whereas Heuristic 3 scales only by item size.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), Heuristic 5 introduces `bin_diversity_bonus` based on the standard deviation of the remaining bin capacities to prioritize bins with more diverse fill levels. Also, the fill ratio weight and the empty/full bin penalties are made adaptive in H5, depending on item size. H4 only uses item scale to adapt the fill bonus weight and uses fixed weights for penalty.

Comparing (5th) vs (7th), Heuristic 7 simplifies the randomization strength and uses inverse relationship to the item size. It also introduces a nearly full bonus with fixed threshold.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), Heuristic 8 adds diversity score based on how close the wasted space is to the item size. It also incorporates a dynamic empty bin penalty adjusting to the current bin landscape.

Comparing (8th) vs (10th), Heuristic 10 removes diversity score and dynamic empty bin penalty. It simplifies adaptive randomization and near full penalty, using less parameters.

Overall: The better heuristics introduce adaptive scaling of bonuses/penalties, considering item size and bin capacity. They promote bin diversity and prevent early commitment to bins that are almost full, while adaptive randomization scales based on bin fullness to diversify selection.

**Experience:**
Adaptive scaling and diverse bin selection are crucial. Favor exploration with smaller items and exploit nearly full bins while avoiding premature commitment. Consider non-linear penalties for wasted space. Dynamically adjust parameters based on the overall bin landscape for more robust performance.
