**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic includes an "empty bin penalty" and "reward for bins close to full," while the worst focuses on waste minimization, fill ratio, and randomization. The best heuristic also uses average fill to scale its "empty bin penalty," while the worst doesn't consider the overall bin landscape.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see (2nd) includes an "empty bin penalty," while (second worst) gives diversity bonus. The second best focuses wastespace and fillratio bonuses. The adaptive randomization strategies differ. Second best use  `item * (bins_remain_cap.max() - bins_remain_cap) / bins_remain_cap.max()` for randomization strength, while (second worst) use `0.1 * item * (np.max(bins_remain_cap) - bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins]) / np.max(bins_remain_cap)`.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) includes `Reward bins close to full before insertion` to encourage packing, whereas the (2nd) does not.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that (3rd) use non-linear wasted space and adaptive fill ratio bonus, whereas (4th) use waste-based prioritization (smaller waste is better) for prioritizing.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both include adaptive randomization to some extent. (second worst) gives diversity bonus, and the (worst) gives bonus for almost full bins.

Overall:
The better-performing heuristics incorporate a wider range of factors beyond just waste minimization and fill ratio. They include elements like penalties for using almost-empty bins, rewards for using almost-full bins, diversity incentives, and adaptive randomization. Scaling factors based on item size, remaining bin capacity, and overall bin landscape (average fill level) seem to improve performance. Non-linear penalties for wasted space also appear beneficial.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider factors beyond basic objectives like waste minimization. Adaptive scaling, penalties, and rewards based on the overall state of the problem can lead to significantly better results. Don't be afraid to experiment with non-linear penalties or bonuses.
