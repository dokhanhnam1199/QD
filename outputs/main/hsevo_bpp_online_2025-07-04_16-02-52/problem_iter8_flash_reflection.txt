**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical except the 3rd code allows to set hyperparameter.
*   Comparing (5th) vs (6th), they are identical except the 5th code allows to set hyperparameter.
*   Comparing (6th) vs (7th) to (11th), they are identical.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (12th), the 1st code has empty bin penalty and the 12th code has not. The 1st code has randomization factor scaled by item size and 12th code uses normal distribution. The 1st code explicitly set -inf for infeasible bins.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (13th), the 13th code has adaptive fill ratio bonus (scale by item size relative to bin size); controlled randomization (scale randomization by (1 - item_scale) to favor exploration for smaller items); adaptive bin-emptiness penalty (heavier penalty for emptier bins, scaled by remaining capacity); encourage bins nearing full capacity.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (14th), the 14th code uses `min_remaining_cap` as waste minimization.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (15th), the 15th code does not have `empty_bin_penalty` and `randomization`.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (16th), the 16th code uses `min_remaining_cap` for waste minimization and does not have `empty_bin_penalty`.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (17th), the 17th code does not have `empty_bin_penalty` and `randomization`.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (18th), the 18th code is the same as the 13th code.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (19th), the 19th code uses non-linear transformation to penalize larger wasted space more heavily; adaptive randomization; bonus for bins that fit the item almost perfectly.
*   Comparing (19th) vs (20th), they are identical.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical.

Overall: The best heuristics include: best-fit, fill ratio, controlled randomization and bin-emptiness discouragement with adaptive parameters. The worst heuristics only consider minimal waste and fill ratio.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating adaptive parameters that adjust based on item size, bin capacity, and fill levels. Also, add a small amount of randomization for exploration, and penalize empty bins to prevent premature filling of small bins.
