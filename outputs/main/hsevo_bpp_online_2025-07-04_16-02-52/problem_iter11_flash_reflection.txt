**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first employs a more comprehensive approach, incorporating waste minimization with a non-linear penalty, adaptive fill ratio bonuses, controlled randomization scaled by item size, adaptive bin-emptiness penalties, and bonuses for bins nearing full capacity. The 20th prioritizes waste, fill ratio, and adaptive randomization, but lacks the non-linear penalty for waste, the adaptive bin-emptiness penalty, and the bonus for almost full bins. Comparing (5th) vs (16th), the 5th introduces bin diversity and prevents early commitment to almost full bins, which are absent in the 16th. Comparing (14th) vs (15th), these functions are identical stubs with only infeasible bin handling, making them the worst. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the first has a simpler approach, while the fifth adds more fine-grained control over penalties/bonuses based on multiple factors (item size, remaining capacity, etc). Overall: better heuristics have more comprehensive penalty and bonus mechanisms (adaptive fill ratios, bin-emptiness considerations, and near-capacity bonuses) and incorporate randomness. These mechanisms are frequently scaled based on item size and/or remaining bin capacity.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating a variety of factors beyond the primary objective, such as adaptive penalties and bonuses based on item characteristics and bin states. Also, controlled randomness and diversity measures can improve exploration.
