**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic prioritizes bins based on the absolute difference between remaining capacities after packing and the minimum remaining capacity, combined with a fill ratio bonus. The worst heuristic focuses on the fit ratio and capacity, with a tiny random exploration factor. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) the second best introduces randomness scaled by the item size and considers a "near fit" bonus. Second worst focuses heavily on fit ratio. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the key difference lies in how waste is handled. (3rd) vs (4th), 3rd prioritizes based on the inverse of remaining space. (5th) vs (6th), 5th gives a high priority to fitting items. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the random factor is negligible in worst. Overall: The best heuristics appear to strike a balance between minimizing waste, encouraging full bins, and a degree of randomization for exploration, without overemphasizing raw capacity or fit ratios.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics require a balanced approach, considering multiple factors such as waste minimization, fill ratio, and exploration. Adaptive parameters, like randomness scaled by item size, can improve performance. Prioritizing a combination of these elements often leads to better solutions than focusing on a single metric.
