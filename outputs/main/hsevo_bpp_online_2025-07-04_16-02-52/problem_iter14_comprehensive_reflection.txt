Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive parameters, balanced approach, multiple factors (waste, fill ratio, exploration), dynamic adjustment, overall landscape.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt based on item/bin states, balancing waste minimization with exploration. Prioritize heuristics that consider the interplay between parameters and their impact on solution quality.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic heuristics focused solely on remaining capacity, complex analogies, relying solely on random factors without a clear strategy.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple rules. Focus on creating a system that reacts intelligently to the current packing state, leveraging diverse factors in a coordinated manner for robust performance.
