**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (2nd) vs (3rd), we see that all three heuristics are identical. This suggests the ranking is based on some external factor, not code differences.
*   Comparing (4th) vs (6th), (4th) has more advanced features: dynamic waste minimization using a cubic penalty, fill ratio bonus with non-linear fullness boost, dynamic randomization based on item size and capacity variance, emptiness penalty adjusted by occupancy, bonus for almost full bins, and an exploration bonus for smaller items. Heuristic (6th) combines waste minimization (non-linear), fill ratio, empty bin penalty and almost full bin. Overall, (4th) seems like a better approach due to its dynamic, non-linear nature and more features.
*   Comparing (5th) vs (7th), both have same structure with adaptive heuristic combining waste minimization, fill ratio, bin landscape awareness, and dynamic exploration.
*   Comparing (8th) vs (10th), (8th) has Large Item Consideration (New): Incentivize placing large items in emptier bins.
*   Comparing (19th) vs (20th), these two heuristics are identical. It highlights a focus on waste minimization, adaptive fill ratio, controlled randomization, an empty bin penalty, and an almost full reward.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), the initial heuristics have a simpler, more fundamental structure focusing on waste minimization and fill ratio. As the ranking goes down, the heuristics get more complex, incorporating adaptive parameters, non-linear penalties, and randomization strategies.
*   Comparing (17th) vs (18th), heuristic (17th) utilizes hardcoded coefficients and (18th) uses hardcoded variable as arguments.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate dynamic elements, non-linear scaling, item-size awareness, and exploration/exploitation strategies, while lower-ranked heuristics tend to be simpler and less adaptive.

**Experience:**

Design better heuristics by incorporating dynamic, adaptive parameters scaled by item size, bin capacity, and average occupancy. Employ non-linear penalties and bonuses to fine-tune behavior. Introduce controlled randomization for exploration and balance it with exploitation.
