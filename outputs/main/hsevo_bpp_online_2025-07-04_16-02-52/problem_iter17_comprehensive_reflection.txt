Okay, I'm ready to help design better heuristics, focusing on avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection and aiming for that $999K improvement! Here's a redefined approach to "current self-reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Exploration/Exploitation Balance, Non-linear Penalties.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to the state of the problem, emphasizing exploration with small items and exploitation of nearly full bins. Use non-linear penalties for wasted space.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, static heuristics, complex and inefficient calculations, and relying solely on remaining capacity.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should be state-aware, balancing exploration and exploitation by dynamically adjusting parameters based on item characteristics and bin states, while avoiding premature commitment and overly simplistic or computationally expensive strategies.
