Here's a refined definition of "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, incorporating your guidance:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive parameters, multi-objective balance, exploration, penalization, performance analysis.

*   **Advice:** Design adaptive heuristics dynamically adjusting to problem state (item sizes, bin capacities). Quantify and balance waste, fill ratios, and runtime. Incorporate strategic exploration using problem-aware randomization.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex analogies. Sole reliance on simple metrics like remaining capacity. Prioritizing speed without regard to solution quality.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require balancing competing objectives through adaptive, problem-aware parameters. Monitor heuristic performance on diverse instances to identify areas for improvement.
