Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Here's a redefined approach to \"current self-reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Exploration/Exploitation Balance, Non-linear Penalties.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to the state of the problem, emphasizing exploration with small items and exploitation of nearly full bins. Use non-linear penalties for wasted space.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, static heuristics, complex and inefficient calculations, and relying solely on remaining capacity.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should be state-aware, balancing exploration and exploitation by dynamically adjusting parameters based on item characteristics and bin states, while avoiding premature commitment and overly simplistic or computationally expensive strategies.\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
