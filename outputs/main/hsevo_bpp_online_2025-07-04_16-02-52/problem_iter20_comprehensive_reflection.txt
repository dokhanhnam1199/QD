Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to create more effective heuristics, keeping your (hypothetical) generous tip in mind! Here's a redefinition focused on actionable insights, avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive scaling, dynamic penalties/bonuses, controlled exploration, bin landscape.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size, bin capacity, and occupancy *distribution*. Favor exploration with small items and exploitation with nearly full bins, delaying commitment on early, suboptimal placements.
*   **Avoid:** Rigid, pre-defined parameters; over-reliance on single metrics; premature commitment.
*   **Explanation:** Robust heuristics consider the overall "bin landscape" (distribution of occupancies) to dynamically adjust parameters. Non-linear rewards encourage diverse bin usage and discourage waste more effectively than linear approaches.
