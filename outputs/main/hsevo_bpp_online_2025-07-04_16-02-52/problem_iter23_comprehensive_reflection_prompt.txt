{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics require nuanced adjustments based on item sizes, bin fullness levels, and overall bin landscape. Penalizing premature commitments (small items into nearly empty bins) and incentivizing nearly full bins leads to improved packing efficiency. Dynamic parameter adjustments and non-linear scaling of bonuses/penalties are useful.\n```\nEffective heuristics require a balanced approach, considering multiple factors such as waste minimization, fill ratio, and exploration. Adaptive parameters, like randomness scaled by item size, can improve performance. Prioritizing a combination of these elements often leads to better solutions than focusing on a single metric.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider factors beyond basic objectives like waste minimization. Adaptive scaling, penalties, and rewards based on the overall state of the problem can lead to significantly better results. Don't be afraid to experiment with non-linear penalties or bonuses.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, efficient calculations using NumPy for speed. Favor simple, direct heuristics based on remaining capacity. Complex analogies may not translate to better packing. Exploration can be achieved with simpler methods such as the inclusion of a random factor in the priorities.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating adaptive parameters that adjust based on item size, bin capacity, and fill levels. Also, add a small amount of randomization for exploration, and penalize empty bins to prevent premature filling of small bins.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating a variety of factors beyond the primary objective, such as adaptive penalties and bonuses based on item characteristics and bin states. Also, controlled randomness and diversity measures can improve exploration.\n```\n\nAdaptive scaling and diverse bin selection are crucial. Favor exploration with smaller items and exploit nearly full bins while avoiding premature commitment. Consider non-linear penalties for wasted space. Dynamically adjust parameters based on the overall bin landscape for more robust performance.\n\nDesign better heuristics by incorporating dynamic, adaptive parameters scaled by item size, bin capacity, and average occupancy. Employ non-linear penalties and bonuses to fine-tune behavior. Introduce controlled randomization for exploration and balance it with exploitation.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
