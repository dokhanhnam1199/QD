Okay, here's a refined concept of "Current Self-Reflection" tailored for designing better packing heuristics, steering clear of potential pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Capacity-focused, Computationally Efficient, Adaptive Exploration, Iterative Refinement.

*   **Advice:** Emphasize quick capacity checks, explore simple randomization for diversification, and design for incremental improvement through iterative testing.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex strategies, analogies without clear performance benefits, and premature optimization.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on rapid evaluation and adaptation based on remaining space. Simple, fast heuristics, combined with controlled randomness, allow efficient exploration and iterative refinement through experimentation.
