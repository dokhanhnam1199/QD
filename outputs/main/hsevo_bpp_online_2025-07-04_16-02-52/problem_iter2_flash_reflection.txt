**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic directly calculates the `min_remaining_cap` among valid bins and prioritizes bins based on their proximity to this minimum, also incorporating a small bonus for bins that are almost full and using numpy operations, leading to a more efficient and potentially better packing strategy. The 20th heuristic uses a "potential energy" and "tunneling" analogy, which might be less direct and less effective in practice due to the specific formulation of the energy and tunneling terms. Also the 1st heuristic is more concise.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd heuristic prioritizes bins based on the inverse of remaining space and assigns very low priority to bins where the item doesn't fit, using a loop-based approach. The 19th heuristic tries to apply more complex calculations.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses a simpler logic assigning priorities and extra weights to the fit items. The 4th uses the inverse of remaining space.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the 19th and 20th heuristics are near identical.

Overall: The better heuristics use numpy operations to achieve better efficiency. They calculate remaining capacities and derive priority based on capacity. More complex heuristics do not guarantee better performance.

**Experience:**
Prioritize clear, efficient calculations using NumPy for speed. Favor simple, direct heuristics based on remaining capacity. Complex analogies may not translate to better packing. Exploration can be achieved with simpler methods such as the inclusion of a random factor in the priorities.
