Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Heuristic: Prioritize bins where the item fits and leaves the least waste.\n    # If item doesn't fit, assign a very low priority.\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    for i, cap in enumerate(bins_remain_cap):\n        if cap >= item:\n            # Calculate remaining space after adding the item.\n            remaining_space = cap - item\n            # Give higher priority to bins with smaller remaining space, but not zero to avoid numerical issues.\n            priorities[i] = 1 / (remaining_space + 0.001)  # Inverse of remaining space\n        else:\n            # Item doesn't fit; very low priority.\n            priorities[i] = -1e9  # A very large negative number to penalize infeasibility\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This version prioritizes bins with remaining capacity slightly larger than the item size,\n    while penalizing bins that are either too small or too large.

Give them a very low priority.\n    priorities = np.where(waste < 0, -np.inf, 0)\n\n    # Prioritize bins where waste is small but positive.  A quadratic function is used to shape the priorities.\n    # The ideal waste is near zero, and the priority decreases as waste increases.\n    # We can tune the parameters to control the shape of the priority function.\n    ideal_waste = 0.1 * item  # Aim for a bit of waste (e.g., 10% of item size)\n    priority_scale = 10 # scaling factor to influence how strongly the waste affects priority\n\n    valid_bins = waste >= 0\n    priorities[valid_bins] = priority_scale * np.exp(-((waste[valid_bins] - ideal_waste)**2) / (2 * (item/5)**2)) # Gaussian-like priority based on remaining space\n\n    # Introduce a small amount of noise to encourage exploration.\n    noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=bins_remain_cap.shape) # Normal distributed noise, scale 0.1.\n    priorities = priorities + noise\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic directly calculates the `min_remaining_cap` among valid bins and prioritizes bins based on their proximity to this minimum, also incorporating a small bonus for bins that are almost full and using numpy operations, leading to a more efficient and potentially better packing strategy. The 20th heuristic uses a \"potential energy\" and \"tunneling\" analogy, which might be less direct and less effective in practice due to the specific formulation of the energy and tunneling terms. Also the 1st heuristic is more concise.\n\nComparing (2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd heuristic prioritizes bins based on the inverse of remaining space and assigns very low priority to bins where the item doesn't fit, using a loop-based approach. The 19th heuristic tries to apply more complex calculations.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses a simpler logic assigning priorities and extra weights to the fit items. The 4th uses the inverse of remaining space.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), the 19th and 20th heuristics are near identical.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics use numpy operations to achieve better efficiency. They calculate remaining capacities and derive priority based on capacity. More complex heuristics do not guarantee better performance.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined concept of \"Current Self-Reflection\" tailored for designing better packing heuristics, steering clear of potential pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Capacity-focused, Computationally Efficient, Adaptive Exploration, Iterative Refinement.\n\n*   **Advice:** Emphasize quick capacity checks, explore simple randomization for diversification, and design for incremental improvement through iterative testing.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex strategies, analogies without clear performance benefits, and premature optimization.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on rapid evaluation and adaptation based on remaining space. Simple, fast heuristics, combined with controlled randomness, allow efficient exploration and iterative refinement through experimentation.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
