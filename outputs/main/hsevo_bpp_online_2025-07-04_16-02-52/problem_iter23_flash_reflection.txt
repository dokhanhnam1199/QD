**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic includes a bonus for almost full bins and a penalty for placing small items in almost empty bins, which are absent in the worst. (2nd best) vs (19th) reveals that (2nd) does not penalize placing small items in almost empty bins. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical, suggesting other factors influence ranking. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: Top heuristics have nuanced adjustments based on item size and bin fullness, promoting efficient space use and preventing premature commitment to empty bins with small items. They demonstrate better landscape awareness.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics require nuanced adjustments based on item sizes, bin fullness levels, and overall bin landscape. Penalizing premature commitments (small items into nearly empty bins) and incentivizing nearly full bins leads to improved packing efficiency. Dynamic parameter adjustments and non-linear scaling of bonuses/penalties are useful.
