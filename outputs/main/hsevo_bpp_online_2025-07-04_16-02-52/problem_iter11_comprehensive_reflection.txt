Okay, I understand. To refine "Current self-reflection" into something more effective for designing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection," here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted optimization, adaptive parameters, controlled exploration, balanced approach, performance improvement.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that simultaneously consider multiple relevant factors (e.g., waste, fill ratio, bin usage). Implement adaptive mechanisms where parameters (randomness, penalties) respond dynamically to item characteristics and bin states. Employ controlled randomness to promote exploration without sacrificing solution quality.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic or computationally expensive methods, relying solely on a single objective, and analogies that lack clear practical value.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are rarely built upon a single idea or simple calculation. The sweet spot lies in intelligently integrating different factors and allowing the heuristic to adapt to the specific problem instance. Exploration is crucial, but it needs to be managed strategically, not just randomly thrown in.
