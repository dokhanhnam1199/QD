Okay, I understand the goal: to define "Current Self-Reflection" effectively for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a redefined self-reflection framework:

*   **Keywords:** Holistic, Trade-offs, Adaptability, Experimentation.
*   **Advice:** Evaluate heuristics across diverse problem instances and performance metrics (waste, fill). Investigate parameter adaptation based on real-time problem characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, over-reliance on single metrics, and neglecting solution diversity.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance exploitation (using current knowledge) with exploration (discovering new solutions). Continuous evaluation and iterative refinement are key.
