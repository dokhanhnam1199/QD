Consider stricter capacity constraints during sparsification. Heuristics combining edge features could improve performance.

Prioritize depot proximity and softer demand penalties. Refine sparsification for better exploration.

Consider savings, demand, depot proximity, sparsification, and demand-based edge removal for improved heuristics.

Normalization, depot connection scaling, and sparsification percentile are critical for performance.

The better code removes proximity scaling, suggesting it negatively impacts solution quality, and moves up sparsification.

The better code avoids redundant calculations by checking `heuristics_matrix[i, j] > 0` before demand check.

Consider edge existence when capacity-constraining, and avoid redundant checks, for efficiency and accuracy.

Sharpen demand penalties, combine depot proximity with savings, and use stricter capacity checks.

The better code avoids unnecessary computations by checking `heuristics_matrix[i, j] > 0` before demand check.

Sharpen demand penalties, combine depot proximity with savings, and adjust sparsification based on capacity.
