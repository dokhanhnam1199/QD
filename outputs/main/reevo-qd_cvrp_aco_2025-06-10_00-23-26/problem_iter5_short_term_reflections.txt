Incorporate savings, demand considerations, depot proximity, and sparsification into distance-based heuristics.

Proximity scaling to depot was detrimental. Remove it for better performance.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge like savings, demand, and depot connections, then sparsify for efficient sampling.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demands, depot connections), and sparsify to guide sampling.

Incorporate savings, demand considerations, depot proximity, and sparsification for enhanced edge selection.

Incorporate savings, demand considerations, depot proximity, and sparsification for improved heuristics.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demand, depot connections) and sparsify the search space for better sampling.

Incorporate savings, demand, depot proximity, and sparsification for improved edge selection.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demand, depot connections), and sparsify to guide sampling.

The better code removes the proximity-based scaling, suggesting it negatively impacts performance. Focus on savings, demand penalties, depot connections and sparsification.
