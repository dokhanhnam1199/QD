The better code removes scaling based on depot proximity, suggesting it was detrimental. Consider more refined demand penalty and sparsification strategies.

Proximity scaling hurt; sparsification is beneficial. Focus on better demand penalty and depot connection strategies.

The better code removes scaling based on depot proximity, suggesting it negatively impacts performance.

The better code removes scaling heuristics based on proximity to depot, suggesting it was detrimental.

Incorporate savings, demand considerations, depot proximity, and sparsification for effective edge prioritization.

The better code removes scaling based on proximity to the depot, likely improving solution diversity.

Savings, demand awareness, depot proximity, and sparsification improve edge selection for CVRP heuristics.
