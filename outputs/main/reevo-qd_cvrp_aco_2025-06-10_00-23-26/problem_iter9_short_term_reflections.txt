Proximity to the depot and demand-based sparsification improve heuristic quality for CVRP.

Sharpen penalties, boost depot connections more, and sparsify using a combined metric and capacity check.

Incorporate savings, demand considerations, depot encouragement, and sparsification for improved edge selection.

Savings, demand consideration, depot connections, and sparsification improve edge selection for CVRP solutions.

Consider vehicle capacity when sparsifying. Explicitly exclude infeasible edges based on demand.

Sharpen demand penalties, adjust depot boost, combine metrics for sparsification, and enforce capacity constraints.

Savings, demand considerations, depot proximity, and sparsification improve edge selection heuristics for CVRP.

Consider route feasibility during sparsification. Prioritize edges that can form valid routes.

Consider demand constraints during sparsification. Explicitly forbidding infeasible edges boosts performance.

Consider demand constraints more strictly during sparsification. Explicitly forbid infeasible edges.
