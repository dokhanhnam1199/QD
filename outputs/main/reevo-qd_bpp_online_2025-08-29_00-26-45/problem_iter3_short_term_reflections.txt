Prioritize bins *able* to fit the item; consider remaining capacity—don’t just return zeros!

Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space; inverse distance/proximity consistently outperforms uniform/softmax approaches. Consider bin fullness.




Combine exploration (epsilon-greedy) with informed exploitation (fit scores); dynamically adjust exploration rate.




Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; consider item order & bin fullness.
Prioritize exact fits & minimize waste; softmax can be overly uniform—be more decisive.
Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space; consider item size relative to remaining bin capacity. Avoid uniform random choices.




Prioritize tighter fits; avoid negative rewards; consider bin fullness & number.
Prioritize tighter fits, penalize near-full bins, and avoid infinite scores—smoothness matters!
Prioritize minimizing waste & consider item-bin compatibility—exact fit & proximity often outperform random approaches.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Exploration isn't always key; exploit bin characteristics!
