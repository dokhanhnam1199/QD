BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\n## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:\n\n**Focus on fit quality, not just randomness.** Prioritize exact fits & minimal wasted space. Dynamically balance exploration (epsilon-greedy) with exploitation of bin fullness & remaining capacity. Avoid uniform choices; inverse distance/proximity consistently wins.
