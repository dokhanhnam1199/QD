Prioritize feasibility. Normalize waste, then boost the least-waste bin for refined selection.

Feasibility is key. Normalize remaining capacity. Prioritize least wasted space for better packing.

Feasibility, normalization, and minimizing waste improve bin selection. Consider worst-case bin capacity.

Feasibility check, normalization, and wasted space consideration are crucial for bin selection.

Feasibility, normalization, and directly optimizing for low wasted space are key improvements.

Feasibility check, normalization, and minimizing wasted space contribute to better bin selection.

Feasibility check, normalization, and minimizing wasted space improve bin selection in online BPP.

Feasibility is key. Prioritize minimal waste, normalize, and boost the absolutely least wasted bin.

Feasibility is key. Normalize waste and prioritize minimal waste for improved packing.

Feasibility, normalization, and wasted space consideration are key for improved bin selection.
