Feasibility is key. Prioritize minimizing wasted space and boosting the best option.

Consider feasibility, waste minimization, normalization, and boosting the best option for improved performance.

Feasibility, waste minimization, and boosting best choices improve bin packing heuristics. Normalization is key.

Feasibility, wasted space minimization, and boosting best choice improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility check, normalization, and wasted space consideration improve bin selection. Avoid direct ratios.

Feasibility check, waste normalization, and boosting the least-waste bin improve heuristic performance by directly optimizing space usage.

Feasibility matters. Normalize waste. Prioritize bins with the *least* wasted space after packing.

Feasibility is key. Normalize waste. Prioritize bins with the absolute least waste.

Feasibility and minimizing wasted space are crucial. Normalization helps compare bins fairly.

Feasibility check, normalization, and wasted space consideration improve bin selection in online BPP.
