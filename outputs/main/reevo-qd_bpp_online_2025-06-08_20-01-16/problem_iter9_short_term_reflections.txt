Feasibility filtering, waste normalization, and boosting the least-waste bin improve bin selection in online BPP.

Feasibility check, waste minimization, and prioritizing least-waste bins enhance online bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility, waste minimization, normalization, and boosting the best candidate are key improvements.

Prioritize feasibility and minimizing waste. Normalize scores and boost the best candidate.

Feasibility, waste minimization, and normalization are key for effective bin selection.

Feasibility filtering, waste minimization, and boosting best choices improve online bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility is key. Prioritize minimizing waste and reward optimal choices among feasible options.

Feasibility matters. Waste minimization and normalization improve bin selection. Boosting best candidates is beneficial.

Feasibility check, waste normalization, and boosting the least-waste bin improve priority-based bin selection.

Feasibility filtering, normalization, and wasted space minimization improve bin selection in online bin packing.
