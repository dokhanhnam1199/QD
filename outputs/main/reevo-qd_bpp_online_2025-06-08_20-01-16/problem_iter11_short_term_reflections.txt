Feasibility check, normalization, and minimizing wasted space are key to improved performance.

Feasibility, waste minimization, and prioritizing bins with minimal remaining capacity are key to improvement.

Feasibility check and waste minimization are key. Normalize remaining capacities for better comparison.

Feasibility is key. Normalize waste, prioritize minimal waste, and boost best choice for improved results.

Feasibility, waste minimization, normalization, and boosting best choices improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility matters. Normalizing waste and boosting least waste bin improves performance.

Feasibility, normalization, and waste minimization are key. Prioritize bins that can fit and minimize wasted space.

Feasibility and wasted space consideration are key. Normalization improves priority scaling and bin selection.

Feasibility check, waste minimization, normalization, and boosting the best candidate improve heuristic performance.

Feasibility check, wasted space minimization, normalization, and a boost for the best bin improve performance.
