Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into something truly actionable for designing better bin packing heuristics, drawing lessons from what to avoid in "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptivity, state-awareness, multi-objective, parameter tuning, incremental complexity, global perspective, exploration.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt weights and strategies based on item characteristics, bin availability (current capacity, fragmentation), and the overall bin state (fill levels, remaining bins). Prioritize incremental feature addition with performance evaluation at each step. Explore parameters with fine control.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single factors, neglecting global state during decision-making, abrupt priority changes, premature addition of complex functions.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple objectives. Adaptivity to the current state is key. Parameter tuning can make algorithms perform better. Avoid getting stuck in local optima by considering global perspectives and starting with simple heuristics and increasing complexity in steps.
