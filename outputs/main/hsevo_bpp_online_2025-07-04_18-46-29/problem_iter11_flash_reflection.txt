**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), (1st) focuses on filling close-to-full bins using `(bins_remain_cap[potential_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[potential_bins]`, prioritizes smallest remaining capacity, introduces non-linearity and penalizes almost full bins to reduce fragmentation. (3rd) combines fullest bin, near fit bonus, and dynamic fragmentation penalty. Comparing (2nd) vs (4th), (2nd) also focuses on filling close-to-full bins, and penalizes nearly full bins. (4th) gives first fit preference, best fit encouragement and fragmentation penalty. Comparing (19th) vs (20th), they are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Comparing across various pairs, heuristics that combine multiple strategies like best fit, fragmentation avoidance, and target fill levels tend to perform better. Adaptive penalties and bonuses based on remaining capacity or fill ratios also seem to be beneficial. The best heuristics also often include a "first fit" component to encourage initial packing. The heuristics with capacity weights tend to perform better. Overall: the top heuristics combine several factors (best fit, fill ratio, fragmentation penalty, almost empty reuse) with carefully tuned weights and adaptive penalties.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics often require balancing multiple objectives through weighted combinations of different strategies. Adaptive penalties and bonuses that respond to the current state of the bins, such as remaining capacity or fill level, can significantly improve performance. It's crucial to tune the weights and thresholds carefully.
