Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Prioritize careful weight/threshold tuning.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, single-factor approaches. Avoid abrupt changes in behavior. Avoid neglecting parameter optimization.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics benefit from balancing objectives adaptively, with responses tailored to the current state. Careful tuning ensures optimal performance.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
