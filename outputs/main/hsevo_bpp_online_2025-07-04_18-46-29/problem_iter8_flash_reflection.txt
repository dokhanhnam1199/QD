**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a simple combination of filling bins closer to full, prioritizing bins with the smallest remaining capacity and adding a non-linearity component and penalizing near-full bins. While the worst balances waste, fullness, and avoids near-full bins by using a smoothed waste penalty and adaptive bonus for good fit.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see (2nd) considers capacity utilization, smallest remaining capacity, fragmentation penalty, bin balancing, and item size considerations and applies a sigmoid smoothing. In contrast, (19th) balances waste, fullness and avoids near-full bins by using a smoothed waste penalty and adaptive bonus for good fit.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic is simpler and more directly targets filling bins, while the second heuristic attempts a more complex balancing act with more features.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see (3rd) combines best fit, target fullness and adaptive penalty with a small randomness, while (4th) uses tuned parameters to balances waste, fullness, and fit.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), we see they are identical. Overall: Simplicity and direct targeting of fill optimization might be more effective than complex, multi-faceted approaches. Adaptive penalties and bonuses seem useful. Explicit randomization may help.

**Experience:**
Start with simple heuristics focusing on core objectives like fill rate and waste reduction. Add complexity incrementally, evaluating the impact of each feature. Adaptive penalties and bonuses can be effective, but parameter tuning is crucial. Randomness can aid exploration.
