**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first heuristic uses carefully tuned constants and an almost-empty bonus with thresholds and weights. The 20th emphasizes fill ratio, best fit, adaptive fragmentation, reuse, and fill percentage incentive.
(2nd) vs (19th): Heuristic 2 introduces a nonlinear best-fit encouragement and bin balancing, whereas heuristic 19 adjusts fill ratios, best fit, and fragmentation based on average bin capacity and provides fill percentage incentive, and gives stronger boost to best-fit encouragement.
(3rd) vs (18th): Heuristic 3 uses an adaptive item size factor to adjust fill ratio, best fit, fragmentation penalty, empty bin reuse, and too-empty bin discouragement. Heuristic 18 introduces adaptive weighting based on state awareness, fill ratio priority, best-fit bonus, fragmentation penalty, and exploration randomness.
(4th) vs (17th): Heuristic 4 adaptively balances fill, waste, and fragmentation and considers global fill levels, while Heuristic 17 uses adaptive weighting and state awareness for fill ratio, best-fit, fragmentation, almost empty reuse and exploration.
(5th) vs (16th): Heuristic 5 is using adaptive best-fit, target fill and fragmentation penalty, near-empty bonus. The 16th does similar to 5th but without near-empty bonus scaling using remaining capacity.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst (Heuristic 2) uses nonlinear encouragement and bin balancing, and an adaptive fragmentation penalty. The worst (Heuristic 1) relies on a fixed set of parameters.
Overall: The better heuristics emphasize adaptivity, state awareness, and carefully combine various factors, adjusting weights and thresholds dynamically based on item size, bin availability, and global bin fill levels. The worse performing heuristics rely on static weights and less comprehensive combinations of factors. Better heuristics also appear to incorporate penalties for bins that are too full or likely to cause fragmentation.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize adaptivity by incorporating item size, bin availability, and global bin state. Combine multiple factors like fill ratio, best fit, and fragmentation, using dynamic weights. Include penalties for undesirable states, such as near-full or overly empty bins, to improve performance.
