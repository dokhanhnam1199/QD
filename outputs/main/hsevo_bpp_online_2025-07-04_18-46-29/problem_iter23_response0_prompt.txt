Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that the second best includes global state awareness such as global bin utilization, small/large item thresholds and associated bonuses/penalties. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the most important improvement is fine-grained control over weights, fragmentation thresholding and exploration. (3rd) vs (4th) shows no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see a simplified exploration probability. Overall:\n- The best heuristics incorporate adaptive weights based on item size, bin availability, and global fill levels.\n- Fragmentation penalties and almost-empty reuse bonuses are common, but the best heuristics use adaptive thresholds and scaling for these.\n- State-aware exploration, where the exploration rate is adjusted based on the current fill level and bin utilization, is present in better heuristics.\n- The top functions penalize over-utilization, balance bin usage.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" into something truly actionable for designing better bin packing heuristics, drawing lessons from what to avoid in \"Ineffective self-reflection.\"\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptivity, state-awareness, multi-objective, parameter tuning, incremental complexity, global perspective, exploration.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt weights and strategies based on item characteristics, bin availability (current capacity, fragmentation), and the overall bin state (fill levels, remaining bins). Prioritize incremental feature addition with performance evaluation at each step. Explore parameters with fine control.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single factors, neglecting global state during decision-making, abrupt priority changes, premature addition of complex functions.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple objectives. Adaptivity to the current state is key. Parameter tuning can make algorithms perform better. Avoid getting stuck in local optima by considering global perspectives and starting with simple heuristics and increasing complexity in steps.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
