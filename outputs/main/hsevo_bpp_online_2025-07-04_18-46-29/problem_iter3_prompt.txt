Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Encourage filling bins closer to full\n    potential_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if np.any(potential_bins):\n      priorities[potential_bins] = (bins_remain_cap[potential_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[potential_bins]\n\n    # Prioritize bins with smallest remaining capacity that can still fit the item.

Let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective in designing heuristics, keeping your generous tip in mind!\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted analysis, trade-off balancing, mathematical modeling, adaptive mechanisms, iterative refinement, performance metrics, exploration-exploitation.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic performance using diverse metrics. Quantify trade-offs between factors with mathematical functions. Adapt parameters based on problem instance characteristics.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on intuition, single-factor optimization, premature convergence, ignoring problem-specific knowledge, lack of performance evaluation.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple rules. Rigorously evaluate, mathematically model, and adapt heuristics for robust performance across different scenarios. Focus on iterative refinement guided by data.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
