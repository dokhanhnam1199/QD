{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics often require balancing multiple objectives through weighted combinations of different strategies. Adaptive penalties and bonuses that respond to the current state of the bins, such as remaining capacity or fill level, can significantly improve performance. It's crucial to tune the weights and thresholds carefully.\n```\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nFor better heuristics, consider: multiple factors for bin selection (remaining capacity, wasted space, fragmentation), using mathematical functions to balance trade-offs, and special considerations (penalties, bonuses, tiebreakers). Avoid focusing on single factor.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a clear objective function that balances multiple goals, such as minimizing waste and maximizing bin utilization. Use smooth functions to avoid drastic changes in priority and consider adding randomness for exploration. Penalizing states that lead to poor outcomes (e.g. near-full bins) is also beneficial.\n\nStart with simple heuristics focusing on core objectives like fill rate and waste reduction. Add complexity incrementally, evaluating the impact of each feature. Adaptive penalties and bonuses can be effective, but parameter tuning is crucial. Randomness can aid exploration.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
