{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a clear objective function that balances multiple goals, such as minimizing waste and maximizing bin utilization. Use smooth functions to avoid drastic changes in priority and consider adding randomness for exploration. Penalizing states that lead to poor outcomes (e.g. near-full bins) is also beneficial.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nFor better heuristics, consider: multiple factors for bin selection (remaining capacity, wasted space, fragmentation), using mathematical functions to balance trade-offs, and special considerations (penalties, bonuses, tiebreakers). Avoid focusing on single factor.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
