Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective in designing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a focused breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Adaptive, Tuning, State-dependent.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering multiple objectives concurrently and use functions that adapt based on the current problem state. Prioritize careful weight/threshold tuning.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, single-factor approaches. Avoid abrupt changes in behavior. Avoid neglecting parameter optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics benefit from balancing objectives adaptively, with responses tailored to the current state. Careful tuning ensures optimal performance.
