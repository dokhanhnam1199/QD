Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), (1st) focuses on filling close-to-full bins using `(bins_remain_cap[potential_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[potential_bins]`, prioritizes smallest remaining capacity, introduces non-linearity and penalizes almost full bins to reduce fragmentation. (3rd) combines fullest bin, near fit bonus, and dynamic fragmentation penalty. Comparing (2nd) vs (4th), (2nd) also focuses on filling close-to-full bins, and penalizes nearly full bins. (4th) gives first fit preference, best fit encouragement and fragmentation penalty. Comparing (19th) vs (20th), they are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Comparing across various pairs, heuristics that combine multiple strategies like best fit, fragmentation avoidance, and target fill levels tend to perform better. Adaptive penalties and bonuses based on remaining capacity or fill ratios also seem to be beneficial. The best heuristics also often include a \"first fit\" component to encourage initial packing. The heuristics with capacity weights tend to perform better. Overall: the top heuristics combine several factors (best fit, fill ratio, fragmentation penalty, almost empty reuse) with carefully tuned weights and adaptive penalties.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective in designing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of the \"Ineffective self-reflection.\"\n\nHere's a focused breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Adaptive, Tuning, State-dependent.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering multiple objectives concurrently and use functions that adapt based on the current problem state. Prioritize careful weight/threshold tuning.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, single-factor approaches. Avoid abrupt changes in behavior. Avoid neglecting parameter optimization.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics benefit from balancing objectives adaptively, with responses tailored to the current state. Careful tuning ensures optimal performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
