Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,\n                best_fit_weight: float = 1.4784374571582626,\n                fragmentation_threshold_multiplier: float = 0.17647801253530923,\n                fragmentation_penalty: float = 1.2890365111264535,\n                almost_empty_threshold: float = 0.9472202669971742,\n                almost_empty_bonus: float = 0.7797962606982891) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Combines best-fit, fill-ratio, and fragmentation penalty.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

Dynamically adjust weights and incentives based on the *global* state of bins. Incorporate controlled randomness.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static weights, myopic optimization focusing only on individual bins, and overly complex heuristics from the start.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a balanced approach. Adaptive weighting, state awareness, and strategic exploration prevent getting stuck in local optima, while incremental complexity ensures understandability and tunability.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
