Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to build better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls described in "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a focused approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptivity, Multi-objective, Penalties/Bonuses, Global State, Parameter Tuning, Incremental Complexity.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to adapt dynamically to item sizes, bin states (availability, fill level), and overall packing progress. Combine multiple factors (fill ratio, fragmentation) using weighted functions. Start simple and increase complexity, tracking effects.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single factors. Unclear objective functions. Abrupt priority shifts. Untested complexity. Local optima traps.

*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a balanced, adaptive approach to bin packing, considering both local bin states and the global packing context. Tune parameters systematically and iteratively validate the effect of new factors.
