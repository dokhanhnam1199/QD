Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better bin packing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a breakdown to guide your thinking:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Adaptive, Balanced, Exploration, State-aware.

*   **Advice:** Construct a clear objective function combining fill rate, waste, and fragmentation. Dynamically adjust weights and incentives based on the *global* state of bins. Incorporate controlled randomness.

*   **Avoid:** Static weights, myopic optimization focusing only on individual bins, and overly complex heuristics from the start.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a balanced approach. Adaptive weighting, state awareness, and strategic exploration prevent getting stuck in local optima, while incremental complexity ensures understandability and tunability.
