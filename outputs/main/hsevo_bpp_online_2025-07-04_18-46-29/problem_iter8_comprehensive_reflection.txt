Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" into something more effective for designing better heuristics, especially in bin packing or similar optimization problems.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Incremental refinement, objective function alignment, adaptive mechanisms, exploration-exploitation balance.

*   **Advice:** Start with a simple heuristic aligned with the primary objective. Systematically introduce complexity, rigorously evaluating the impact of each addition on the *overall* objective function. Focus on designing adaptive bonuses/penalties *linked directly* to improvements (or deteriorations) in the objective function's value.

*   **Avoid:** Single-factor focus, arbitrary complexity, untuned parameters, and isolated evaluations.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection for heuristic design means consciously connecting new features to the overarching goal. Don't just add penalties or complexity; understand *why* they improve performance relative to the defined objective function.
