**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic uses a combination of encouraging filling bins closer to full, prioritizing bins with the smallest remaining capacity, a non-linearity factor, and penalizing near-full bins. The 20th heuristic uses first fit decreasing, best fit and bin level aware strategies. The key difference is that the 1st uses more nuanced logic with several components.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd heuristic prioritizes bins based on how full they would be made after adding the item, while the 19th prioritizes bins with sufficient remaining capacity, favoring those with slightly larger capacity than the item size, reducing fragmentation. They both address bin capacity but differ on whether to pack full vs leave space, and 19th has bonus/penalty.

Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), the 3rd uses sigmoid function to penalize bins that are close to full, prioritize bins that have space close to item size and prioritize almost full bins. The 18th prioritizes bins that can fit item reasonably well but avoids very tight fits or wasted space. 3rd uses more function.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), the 16th and 17th functions are similar in prioritizing 'just big enough' bins but differ in approach. 16th uses more diverse criteria like feasibility, empty bin avoidance. 17th use fit ratio.

Overall: better heuristics consider multiple factors (remaining capacity, wasted space, fragmentation), using different mathematical functions (sigmoid, exponential decay, etc.) and special considerations (penalties, bonuses, tiebreakers). The worse heuristics focus on fewer or single factor.

**Experience:**
For better heuristics, consider: multiple factors for bin selection (remaining capacity, wasted space, fragmentation), using mathematical functions to balance trade-offs, and special considerations (penalties, bonuses, tiebreakers). Avoid focusing on single factor.
