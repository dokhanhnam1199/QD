Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Encourage filling bins closer to full\n    potential_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if np.any(potential_bins):\n      priorities[potential_bins] = (bins_remain_cap[potential_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[potential_bins]\n\n    # Prioritize bins with smallest remaining capacity that can still fit the item.

Systematically introduce complexity, rigorously evaluating the impact of each addition on the *overall* objective function. Focus on designing adaptive bonuses/penalties *linked directly* to improvements (or deteriorations) in the objective function's value.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Single-factor focus, arbitrary complexity, untuned parameters, and isolated evaluations.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection for heuristic design means consciously connecting new features to the overarching goal. Don't just add penalties or complexity; understand *why* they improve performance relative to the defined objective function.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
