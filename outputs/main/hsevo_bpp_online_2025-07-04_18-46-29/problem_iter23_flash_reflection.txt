**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses heavily tuned weights with adaptive components based on item size, bin availability, average fill, and standard deviation of fill, while the worst uses fixed weights and a simpler exploration strategy. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that the second best includes global state awareness such as global bin utilization, small/large item thresholds and associated bonuses/penalties. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the most important improvement is fine-grained control over weights, fragmentation thresholding and exploration. (3rd) vs (4th) shows no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see a simplified exploration probability. Overall:
- The best heuristics incorporate adaptive weights based on item size, bin availability, and global fill levels.
- Fragmentation penalties and almost-empty reuse bonuses are common, but the best heuristics use adaptive thresholds and scaling for these.
- State-aware exploration, where the exploration rate is adjusted based on the current fill level and bin utilization, is present in better heuristics.
- The top functions penalize over-utilization, balance bin usage.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics with adaptive weights based on item characteristics, bin availability, and global state. Implement dynamic fragmentation penalties and state-aware exploration. Consider encouraging bin utilization balance and penalizing over-utilization.
