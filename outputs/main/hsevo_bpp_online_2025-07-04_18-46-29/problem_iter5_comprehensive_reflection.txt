Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into a more effective approach for designing heuristics. Here's a breakdown designed to avoid the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection and guide you towards better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Objective Function, Multi-Criteria Optimization, Smoothing, Exploration, Penalties, State Evaluation, Adaptive Strategies.

*   **Advice:** Design a well-defined objective function considering multiple interacting criteria. Employ smoothing techniques (e.g., sigmoid functions) for gradual adjustments. Use adaptive penalties.

*   **Avoid:** Rigid, single-factor decision-making. Static weight assignments in objective function, lack of adaptive strategies based on previous state evaluation.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a holistic view. Instead of fixating on one aspect, build an objective function that balances multiple goals. Employ adaptive strategies based on previous results to guide exploration and dynamically adjust penalties/weights.
