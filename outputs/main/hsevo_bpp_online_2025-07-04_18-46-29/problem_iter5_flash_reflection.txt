**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic prioritizes filling bins closer to full while also considering the smallest remaining capacity. The worst heuristic uses a combination of fit scores, empty bin bonuses, almost full penalties, and tight fit bonuses. The best heuristic includes `np.exp(-np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item))` which provides a smooth, non-linear adjustment to priorities, and also penalizes near-full bins. In contrast, the worst heuristic includes an `almost_full_penalty` and `tight_fit_bonus`.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second best uses `waste` and `close_fit`, and it has the First Fit Decreasing component. The second worst combines best-fit and target fill ratio to prioritize bins. The second best gives bonuses for very good fit. The second worst penalizes the almost full bins.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe that the best heuristic uses `bins_remain_cap >= item` multiple times. The second best gives bonus for close fit and applies penalty for nearly full. The best use `potential_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item` to filter before applying calculation.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the only difference is that the (3rd) uses default arguments for parameters, so there is no significant difference in the algorithm.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst prioritizes best fit, incorporating a target fill ratio. The worst combines fit scores, bonuses, and penalties, but the specific combination is not as effective. The key difference lies in the combination of features and the underlying weighting, where the second-worst places higher emphasis on the fill ratio.

Overall:
The best heuristics prioritize a balance between minimizing waste, encouraging fuller bins, and penalizing near-full bins to avoid fragmentation. They also incorporate smooth, non-linear adjustments. The worst heuristics tend to have less effective combinations of bonuses and penalties, or lack a clear strategy for balancing different objectives.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize a clear objective function that balances multiple goals, such as minimizing waste and maximizing bin utilization. Use smooth functions to avoid drastic changes in priority and consider adding randomness for exploration. Penalizing states that lead to poor outcomes (e.g. near-full bins) is also beneficial.
