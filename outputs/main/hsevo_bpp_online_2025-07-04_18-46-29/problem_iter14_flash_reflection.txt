**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first one uses fixed weights for different criteria (fill ratio, best fit, fragmentation, almost empty), while the last one uses adaptive weights based on bin capacity, item size, and the overall state of bins. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows similar pattern.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe that the second one introduces adaptive weighting based on item size and includes a discouragement for bins that are "too empty" after placement, which the first one doesn't have.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third uses the same approach as the second. The forth one introduces the concept of "target fill" and calculates the distance to the ideal fill, as well as using direct values instead of a scaling factor.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are nearly identical.
Overall: The better heuristics tend to incorporate adaptive weighting mechanisms, state-dependent logic, and target specific fill levels, while also penalizing undesirable states like excessive fragmentation or near-empty bins after placement. The worse heuristics use fixed weights and lack a global perspective on the bin states.

**Experience:**
Adaptive weighting based on item size, bin availability, and target fill levels often leads to improved bin packing heuristics. Penalizing undesirable states and encouraging bin reuse are also beneficial strategies. It is important to avoid local optimization and consider the global state of the bins.
