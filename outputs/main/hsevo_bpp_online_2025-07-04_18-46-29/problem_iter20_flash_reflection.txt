**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st uses much more sophisticated adaptive weighting and introduces exploration with randomness scaled by item size. It dynamically adjusts weights based on item size, bin availability, and average fill level. The 20th heuristic uses fixed weights and lacks fine-grained control. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar trend, with more complex adaptive parameters in the better heuristic. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st introduces a large amount of parameter to finetune the algorithm and uses many thresholds to have a finer control of the output while the 2nd uses only a few parameters to define. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that the third heuristic gives bonus to bin with high utilization. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see little to no difference. Overall: better heuristics utilize adaptive weighting, state-aware adjustments, and exploration strategies. They dynamically adjust parameters based on item size, bin availability, average fill level, and other relevant factors, offering finer control and better performance. The best heuristic uses a large amount of parameters.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics with adaptive weights and exploration strategies based on the current state (item size, bin availability, fill level). Finer control and dynamic adjustments lead to superior performance. It would be advantageous to have more parameters to finetune the algorithm.
