Here's a redefined approach to "Current Self-Reflection" designed to build better heuristics, incorporating your feedback and aiming for clear, actionable advice:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Multi-Objective, State-Aware, Exploration-Exploitation.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust their behavior (weights, exploration) based on the *global* state of the bin packing problem, considering factors like item sizes, bin availability, and fill levels. Prioritize multi-objective optimization that explicitly balances competing goals, such as minimizing waste and maximizing bin utilization.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on purely local information or premature focus on fine-tuning a fixed set of parameters. Avoid getting stuck in local optima.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are not rigid; they adapt. They use a combination of factors to choose the best action at any given time. Penalties and bonuses should react to the global state to guide the heuristic toward the best overall packing. Think of the global state as a summary of the entire packing problem (e.g., average fill level, distribution of item sizes, number of almost-full bins).
