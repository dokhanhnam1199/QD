Proximity, load balancing, adaptive sparsification, and a learned component improve heuristic performance.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge like savings, demand, and sparsification for better edge prioritization.

Consider node proximity, adaptive sparsification, load balancing, and demand-based edge boosting for better CVRP heuristics.

Adaptive sparsification and incorporating learned components (like demand boost) improve heuristic performance.

Savings, demand considerations, and sparsification improve edge selection. Explore adaptive k, node proximity, and route shape.

Adaptive sparsification and learned components like demand boost improve heuristic quality.

Focus on effective load management and simpler combinations of key factors like distance, savings, and demand.

Adaptive sparsification and demand-aware edge boosting improve heuristic guidance for stochastic CVRP solvers.

Proximity, adaptive sparsification, load balancing, and demand boosting enhance edge selection for better CVRP heuristics.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demand) and adaptive sparsification. Learned components can further refine edge selection.
