Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demand), sparsify, and learn from solutions.

Incorporate savings, demand, and sparsification. Balance exploration and exploitation; adapt `k` dynamically.

Prioritize proximity, simplify demand impact, and refine sparsification scaling for CVRP heuristics.

Consider depot proximity, adaptive sparsification, demand-based learning, and normalization for improved heuristic design.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demand). Sparsify adaptively. Introduce learned components and scale appropriately.

Better code: Simpler distance/demand factors, logarithmic sparsification, additive demand boost improved performance.

Incorporate savings, demand awareness, sparsification, and capacity-aware edge penalization for better heuristics.

Incorporate savings, demand considerations, adaptive sparsification, and learned components (demand boost) for better performance.

Consider savings, demand, depot proximity, sparsification, learned components, and edge emphasis for improvement.

Consider edge penalties for exceeding capacity and logarithmic scaling of `k` for sparsification.
