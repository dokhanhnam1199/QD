Savings, demand considerations, and sparsification improve edge selection, guiding the search toward better CVRP solutions.

Adaptive sparsification, demand boost, capacity-aware penalization, and normalization improve heuristic quality.

Leverage savings, demand considerations, adaptive sparsification, demand boosting, and capacity-aware penalization for improved solutions.

Prioritize demand feasibility early. Adapt boost based on total demand, penalize capacity overflows.

Prioritize node proximity, direct load balancing, and logarithmic sparsification for improved performance.

Incorporate savings, demand, and sparsification. Dynamically adjust parameters based on problem characteristics.

Normalize factors, use exponential distance, depot proximity, and adaptive sparsification; consider demand boosts.

Logarithmic sparsification, capacity-aware penalization, and total demand scaling improve heuristic performance.

Adaptive sparsification, demand-aware boosting, and capacity-aware penalization improve heuristic quality.

Prioritize feasibility, refine sparsification, and incorporate capacity awareness more effectively.
