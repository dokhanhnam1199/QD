Incorporate savings, proximity, load balancing, adaptive sparsification, and demand awareness for improved edge selection.

Adaptive sparsification and demand-aware boosting improve solution quality by balancing exploration and exploitation.

Incorporate savings, demand, and sparsification. Fine-tune distance/savings weights and k for improved performance.

Focus on direct distance, savings, strict capacity constraints, and logarithmic sparsification for improvements.

Explore dynamic k, reinforcement learning for factor weights, and route similarity for diversification.

Prioritize direct capacity constraints, refine sparsification scaling, and consider depot proximity in demand boosting.

Directly using distance and savings, and preventing overload from start improves performance. Logarithmic sparsification is also useful.

Focus on feasibility (capacity), depot proximity, and demand-aware edge boosting for improvement.

Incorporate node proximity, adaptive sparsification, load balancing, and demand-based learning for improved heuristics.

Normalize factors, penalize exceeding capacity, and add a learned component emphasizing depot connections.
