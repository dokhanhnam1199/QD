    """
    A heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.
    Improved version prioritizing proximity, simplifying demand impact, and refining sparsification scaling.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix (shape: n by n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Customer demands (shape: n).
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (same shape as distance_matrix).
