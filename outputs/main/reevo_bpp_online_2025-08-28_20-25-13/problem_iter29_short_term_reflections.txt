Normalize features to [0,1], tune coefficients via experimentation, and minimize wasted space aggressively.




Reward near-full bins, tight fits, and penalize complete fills; tune weights carefully.
Non-linear bonuses (sigmoid, exponential) & penalties significantly improve BPP heuristic performance. Consider item-bin fit carefully.
Tune coefficients, focus on wasted space, and prioritize fit—simplicity often outperforms complex reward combinations.




Prioritize wasted space *ratio* & tune weights—fullness & fit matter most!
Simplicity & balance often win. Prioritize clear objectives—fullness & fit—with equal weighting. Avoid arbitrary coefficients.




Prioritize minimizing wasted space; tune coefficients balancing fit & utilization for optimal performance.




Simplicity often wins! Focus on core metrics (fullness, fit) & tune weights minimally. Avoid redundant penalties.




Simplify! Focus on key metrics (fullness & fit) & discard potentially misleading ones (wasted space ratio).
Simplicity & balance often win. Focus on clear reward signals—fullness *and* fit—avoiding complex weighting.
