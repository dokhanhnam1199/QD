Focus on utilization & fit—simpler, direct rewards often outperform complex penalties.




Normalize rewards, combine factors with tuned weights, and focus on ratios—not absolute values.
Normalize rewards to a common scale, emphasize density (fullness/fit), and simplify penalties.
Normalize rewards/penalties, tune coefficients, and focus on *ratios*—they’re scale-invariant!




Explicitly penalizing wasted space—beyond just rewarding fit—significantly improves bin packing heuristic performance.




Normalize rewards, emphasize fullness, and tune weights—simplicity & clarity often outperform complex formulas.
Normalize rewards, emphasize fullness, and tune weights—simplicity & clarity often outperform complex formulations.




Explicitly penalizing wasted space—beyond just rewarding fit—significantly improves bin packing heuristic performance.
Focus on directly optimizing for key metrics (utilization, waste) & add targeted bonuses for desirable states.




Normalize rewards, emphasize density (fullness & fit), and simplify penalties for robust performance.
