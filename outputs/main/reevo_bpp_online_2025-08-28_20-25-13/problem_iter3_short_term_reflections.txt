Prioritize tighter fits, avoid division by zero, and consider bin utilization—not just raw capacity.
Prioritize proximity & avoid zero values; softmax can help, but direct inverse distance often works better.




Prioritize specific matches first, then leverage remaining capacity gradients for better bin utilization.
Combine exploitation (informed choices) with exploration (randomness); consider item density & bin fragmentation.
Prioritize tight fits & use non-linear scoring (like sigmoid) to differentiate bin suitability effectively.




Prioritize fit *and* penalize impossible fits; smooth scores with non-linear functions (like sigmoid).
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; exploration isn't always key for initial performance.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; avoid division by zero. Consider bin fullness too!
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; avoid division by zero—small adjustments yield big gains.
Balance exploration (randomness) with exploitation (best fit); consider item order & bin fullness.
