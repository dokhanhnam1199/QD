Focus on utilization, fit, *and* penalizing wasted space—avoiding both full & nearly-empty bins.




Consider item frequency & simpler combinations; avoid excessive penalties—prioritize utilization & fit.




Prioritize simplicity & exploit proximity; avoid complex utilization calculations—inverse distance often works surprisingly well.




Penalize post-item fragmentation; balance utilization with minimizing large remaining spaces. Consider item size!
Combine utilization *and* remaining capacity; don’t solely rely on inverse remaining capacity.
Simplicity often wins. Focus on utilization & fit; avoid overly complex fragmentation penalties.
Prioritize simplicity & strong features—utilization & fit—over complex fragmentation penalties. Less is often more!




Prioritize utilization *and* avoid fragmentation; balance immediate gain with future packing possibilities.




Prioritize both utilization *and* avoiding small remaining spaces—balance fit & fragmentation.

Favoring near-full bins *and* rewarding tight fits (avoiding large remainders) generally improves BPP performance.
