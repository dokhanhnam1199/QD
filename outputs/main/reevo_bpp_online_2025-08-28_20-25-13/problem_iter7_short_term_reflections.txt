Prioritize tighter fits; avoid zero distances & use smooth, monotonic scoring functions.
Prioritize tighter fits; avoid zero divisions; consider item size relative to bin remainders.
Prioritize bins nearing item size; avoid zero differences; smooth scores aren't always better.
Prioritize tighter fits! Consider both waste *and* how full bins already are.
Prioritize tighter fits—smaller distances between item size and bin remaining capacity—for improved packing density.




Prioritize tighter fits—smaller distances between item size & remaining bin capacity—for better packing density.




Prioritize minimizing waste; avoid explicit sorting; use inverse relationships for efficient bin selection.
Prioritize simplicity & direct fit; avoid unnecessary smoothing unless demonstrably helpful. Inverse distance often works well.




Prioritize minimizing wasted space; consider item size *relative* to bin capacity, avoid zero divisions.
Prioritize closeness—smaller remaining capacity often leads to better packing density & fewer bins.
