Prioritize fullness & tight fits; penalize wasted space—balance utilization and minimizing fragmentation.
Balance utilization, fit, *and* penalize wasted space; tune weighting for optimal performance.
Prioritize utilization *and* proximity; filter impossible bins first for efficiency & focus.
Simplicity often wins! Focus on core principles like minimizing wasted space directly—avoid complex reward combinations.

Prioritize near-full bins, tight fits, and *penalize* wasted space—balance utilization and minimizing fragmentation.




Prioritize utilization, minimize wasted space, and reward nearly-full bins—balance fit & efficiency.
Reward near-full & tight fits, penalize wasted space. Balance exploration via multiple factors.




Simplicity often wins! Remove redundant terms; focus on core utilization & inverse residual capacity.




Prioritize tight, near-full fits & *penalize* wasted space—balance utilization and minimizing fragmentation.




Simplicity often wins! Focus on core metrics (utilization, remaining space) & avoid unnecessary penalties.
