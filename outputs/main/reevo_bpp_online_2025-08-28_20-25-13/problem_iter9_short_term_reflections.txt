Prioritize tighter fits *and* consider bin utilization—not just wasted space—for improved packing.




Simplicity & directness often win. Focus on core fit, avoid unnecessary normalization/ratios.

Simplicity & directness often win. Focus on remaining space, avoid complex normalization.
Simpler is often better; avoid unnecessary normalization & ratios. Focus on direct fit/remaining space.
Simplicity & direct fit are key. Prioritize minimizing *remaining* space, avoid complex normalization.
Prioritize tighter fits & avoid zero divisions; simplicity often outperforms complex normalization.
Simplicity often wins! Focus on direct fit; avoid unnecessary normalization/ratios. Prioritize minimizing *actual* wasted space.




Prioritize tighter fits—minimizing wasted space—and handle zero differences carefully for stability.
Simpler is often better; focus on direct fit & avoid unnecessary normalization/ratios.
Prioritize tighter fits—minimize wasted space! Consider item size *relative* to bin remaining capacity.
