## BPP Heuristic Design - Constructive Hints:

Prioritize **exact fits** first. Then, score bins by **inverse remaining space** (direct waste!). Use a **smooth prioritization** (like sigmoid) for fit quality, but keep it **simple**. Favor **fuller bins** & avoid complex scaling/penalties. **Simplicity wins!**
