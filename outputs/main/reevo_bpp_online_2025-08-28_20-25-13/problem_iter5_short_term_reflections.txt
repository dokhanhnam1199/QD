Simplicity & proximity often win. Avoid complex scaling; direct inverse relationships are effective.
Prioritize exact fits, then smallest remaining capacity; avoid complex, unnecessary functions. Simplicity often wins.




Smooth prioritization (sigmoid) & focusing on feasible fits (avoiding infinite penalties) generally improves BPP heuristic performance.




Focus on minimizing waste *directly*; simpler, distance-based approaches often outperform complex, weighted combinations.




Focus on fit *quality* (ratio), smoothness (sigmoid), and avoid explicit bonuses/penalties. Simplicity often wins.




Simplicity & waste minimization often win. Avoid complex sigmoid functions; direct waste calculation is effective.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste; simple, weighted scoring often beats complex functions.
Prioritize exact fits, tighter fits, & explore fuller bins; combine multiple scoring signals strategically.
Simplicity often wins! Directly map remaining space to priorityâ€”avoid complex, tuned functions.
Simplicity often wins. Prioritize direct fit (inverse distance) over complex, tuned functions.
