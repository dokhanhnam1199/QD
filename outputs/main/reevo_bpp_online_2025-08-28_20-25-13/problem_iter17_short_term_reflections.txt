Simplicity often wins! Focus on core fit—avoid complex utilization weighting. Proximity (inverse distance) is key.




Combine utilization *and* remaining capacity—balance fullness & snug fit—for improved bin packing.




Simpler often wins! Combine complementary metrics directly; avoid unnecessary weighting experiments.
Simplicity often wins. Focus on key fit metrics—like remaining space—directly, avoiding complex combinations.




Prioritize utilization *and* proximity; filter impossible bins first—avoiding wasted computation improves performance.




Prioritize snug fits & fullness; avoid fragmentation penalties; consider inverse remaining space & utilization ratios.




Combine complementary objectives—utilization & remaining space—additively, balance their influence carefully.




Simplicity & direct fit are key. Avoid complex combinations; prioritize immediate capacity/proximity.




Avoid zero denominators! Small non-zero values prevent division-by-zero issues & maintain gradient information.




Balance utilization & fit; consider relative remaining space, not just absolute values.
