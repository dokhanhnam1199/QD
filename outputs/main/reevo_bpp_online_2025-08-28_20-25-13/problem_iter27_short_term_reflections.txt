Prioritize directly rewarding desired states (fullness, tight fit) & simplify weighting—less is more!
Prioritize simplicity & direct rewards—combining utilization and fit often outperforms tuned, weighted components.
Focus on utilization, remaining space, and bonus/penalize near-full/empty bins. Experiment with non-linear bonuses.




Prioritize fullness, tight fits, *and* penalize wasted space—tune weights accordingly.




Emphasize fullness & fit, *penalize* wasted space directly—avoid redundant metrics & tune coefficients.
Prioritize non-dimensional rewards, adjust weights carefully, and avoid direct wasted space penalties.
Prioritize minimizing wasted space *directly*; tune coefficients based on problem instance characteristics.
Simplicity & direct rewards (fullness, fit) often outperform complex, tuned penalties/bonuses. Focus on core objectives.




Normalize values, tune coefficients, and penalize wasted space—small changes yield significant BPP performance gains.




Prioritize simplicity & direct rewards; combine complementary metrics (fullness, fit, waste) with tuned weights.
