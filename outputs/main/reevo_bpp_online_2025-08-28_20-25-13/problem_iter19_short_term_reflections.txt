Prioritize utilization *and* proximity; consider wasted space—avoiding fragmentation improves packing density.
Combine utilization *and* remaining space—don't rely solely on proximity fit. Balance is key!
Prioritize utilization *directly*; combine with fit—avoiding ratios can improve performance.




Balance utilization & remaining space; avoid strong weighting—simpler combinations often outperform tuned weights.




Prioritize utilization *directly*; balance it with remaining space—avoiding ratios can help.
Prioritize bins minimizing *future* waste; consider item size relative to remaining capacity—don’t just check fit.
Combine utilization *and* remaining space; filter impossible bins first for efficiency. Consider item frequency.




Simplicity & focusing on a single, strong principle (proximity) often outperforms complex combinations. Avoid unnecessary normalization.




Combine utilization *and* fit; consider wasted space—don't *just* minimize remaining capacity.

Prioritize utilization *and* minimize future fragmentation—consider both remaining space & post-pack waste.
