Focus on remaining space; avoid zero differences & prioritize proximity—small adjustments yield significant gains.




Favor simplicity & proximity; avoid overly specific rules—inverse distance often outperforms exact-fit prioritization.




Prioritize tighter fits *and* consider bin utilization—avoid nearly-empty bins! Small non-zero values help stability.




Favor proximity & avoid zero divisions; small adjustments can significantly improve bin packing heuristics.




Prioritize tighter fits—smaller remaining space is generally better for bin packing. Avoid simply rewarding exact fits.




Prioritize minimizing wasted space; consider item size relative to bin emptiness—proximity matters!




Focus on *residual capacity*—smaller differences often lead to better packing density. Avoid ratios!
Focus on bin *space utilization* & *proximity*—avoiding fragmentation is key for online BPP.




Favor proximity & avoid zero divisions. Small adjustments can significantly improve bin packing heuristic performance.




Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste; consider remaining space, not just ratios.
