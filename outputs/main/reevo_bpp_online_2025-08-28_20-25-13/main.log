Your task is to write a priority function using the Sigmoid Fit Score strategy for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

[2025-08-28 20:30:00,722][root][INFO] - Long-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize tighter fits, avoid division by zero, and consider bin utilization—not just raw capacity.
Prioritize proximity & avoid zero values; softmax can help, but direct inverse distance often works better.




Prioritize specific matches first, then leverage remaining capacity gradients for better bin utilization.
Combine exploitation (informed choices) with exploration (randomness); consider item density & bin fragmentation.
Prioritize tight fits & use non-linear scoring (like sigmoid) to differentiate bin suitability effectively.




Prioritize fit *and* penalize impossible fits; smooth scores with non-linear functions (like sigmoid).
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; exploration isn't always key for initial performance.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; avoid division by zero. Consider bin fullness too!
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; avoid division by zero—small adjustments yield big gains.
Balance exploration (randomness) with exploitation (best fit); consider item order & bin fullness.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:

**Focus:** Exact fits first, *then* minimize waste. Prioritize tightest *possible* fits (using non-linear scoring like sigmoid). Avoid division by zero! Balance exploitation of best fits with limited, informed exploration considering bin fullness & item density.





[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Inverse Distance (Proximity Fit).
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the difference between the item size and the remaining capacity of each bin
    diff = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Avoid division by zero by setting differences less than or equal to zero to a small value.
    diff = np.where(diff <= 0, 1e-6, diff)

    # Calculate the inverse distance (proximity fit) score for each bin.
    priorities = 1.0 / diff

    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
