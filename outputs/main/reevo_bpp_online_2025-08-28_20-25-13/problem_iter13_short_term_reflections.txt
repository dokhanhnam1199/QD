Prioritize exact fits & nearly full bins; avoid leaving excessive wasted space.
Prioritize tighter fits! Penalize nearly-full bins less; avoid early saturation. Consider item order too.




Prioritize near-fits, avoid invalid placements (negative space), and address potential division-by-zero issues.




Prioritize utilization & fit—consider both remaining space *and* how full bins become.




Prioritize near-full bins; avoid zero-waste obsession; small adjustments significantly improve performance.
Prioritize tighter fits—small remaining capacity is good. Avoid zero-division; add a tiny value instead.




Prioritize tighter fits *and* fuller bins; consider bin utilization alongside remaining capacity.




Prioritize utilization *and* consider remaining space—avoiding fragmentation is key for online BPP.
Focus on minimizing waste; proximity-based scoring (inverse distance) with stability (avoiding zero division) often excels.




Consider item size *relative* to bin capacity; penalize near-full bins proactively—don't just check fit.
