Focus on simplicity & item-bin *fit*; avoid complex utilization calculations. Proximity (inverse distance) often outperforms.




Prioritize fit *and* bin fullness; relative item size matters for penalty tuning.
Simplicity & inverse distance often win. Avoid complex penalties; focus on direct fit assessment.




Simplicity often wins! Focus on core principles; avoid over-engineering with potentially diminishing returns bonuses. 




Prioritize space utilization *and* consider how full bins will be *after* placement. Balance is key!




Simplicity often wins! Focus on core fitâ€”avoid complex penalties; proximity/inverse distance is effective.




Prioritize utilization *and* proximity; filter impossible bins first for efficiency & clarity.
Consider relative remaining capacity, not just absolute remaining space, and tune penalty strength carefully.
Simplicity & direct fit often outperform complex scoring; prioritize minimizing remaining space directly.
Balance utilization *and* remaining space; avoid solely focusing on tightest fits. Consider inverse relationships.
