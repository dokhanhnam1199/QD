**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that Heuristic 1st employs a sophisticated multi-factor scoring system, incorporating a non-linear penalty for remaining capacity and a bonus for relative fill, aiming to optimize bin utilization. In stark contrast, Heuristic 20th simply returns an array of zeros, effectively providing no intelligent guidance for bin selection and leading to arbitrary placement. This fundamental difference in strategy explains why 1st is ranked best and 20th is worst.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), Heuristic 2nd is a highly refined strategy similar to 1st, adding an explicit bonus for perfect fits. Heuristic 19th, like 20th, returns all zeros, offering no strategic value. The performance difference mirrors that of 1st vs 20th, showcasing the superiority of intelligent heuristics over no strategy.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), Heuristic 1st omits the explicit `perfect_fit_bonus` found in Heuristic 2nd. The fact that 1st performs better suggests that its combination of a non-linear penalty (where `rem_cap_penalty_exponent > 1`) and a relative fill bonus (rewarding `item / fitting_bins_remain_cap`) implicitly handles perfect and tight fits so effectively that an additional, large, explicit bonus becomes redundant or even detrimental. An overly aggressive, discrete bonus might lead to local optima that are not globally efficient, perhaps by prioritizing a perfect fit in a bin when another less "perfect" fit could lead to better overall packing for future items.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both implement a `perfect_fit_bonus`. However, Heuristic 4th applies a higher bonus (`180.0` vs `150.0`) and uses a `perfect_fit_threshold` to define "near-perfect fits" more broadly (i.e., `remaining_after_placement <= threshold`) than 3rd's stricter `np.abs(remaining_after_placement) < perfect_fit_tolerance`. Heuristic 3rd being better than 4th indicates that making the "perfect fit" bonus too large or applying it too broadly (to a wider threshold) can degrade performance. This reinforces the idea that over-incentivizing specific conditions might lead to less optimal global solutions in complex packing scenarios.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), both heuristics are identical, returning `np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)`. This implies they offer no intelligence in bin selection and are thus equally poor, ranking at the very bottom.

Overall: The best-performing heuristics (1st-6th) leverage multi-component scoring. A non-linear penalty for remaining capacity is highly effective for promoting tight fits. The "relative fill bonus" (prioritizing items that occupy a large proportion of *current* available bin space) appears to be a crucial component for efficient bin utilization. Simpler heuristics, such as pure "Best Fit" (13th, 14th) or "Proportional Fill" (10th, 15th), perform poorly, as do those relying only on linear penalties (7th, 8th). Explicit "perfect fit" bonuses, while intuitive, need careful calibration, as the top heuristic (1st) excels without one, suggesting a smoothly weighted function can implicitly capture this goal better than an abrupt, large bonus. Complex heuristics (e.g., 16th), even with good ideas, can perform poorly if parameters are not optimally tuned.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics with multi-factor scoring. Prioritize non-linear penalties for remaining capacity and relative fill bonuses for efficient utilization. A well-calibrated continuous priority function often outperforms discrete, overly aggressive bonuses for specific conditions like perfect fits. Parameter tuning is paramount. Avoid overly simplistic "Best Fit" or "Proportional Fill" as standalone strategies.
