Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Focuses on maximizing bin utilization by prioritizing bins that offer the highest proportional fill.\n\n    This heuristic adaptively weighs each bin's suitability based on the item's\n    relative size to the bin's current capacity, exploiting the pattern\n    of high-density packing for efficient bin closure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize scores for all bins to negative infinity, ensuring bins where\n    # the item cannot fit are never selected.\n    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n\n    # Identify bins with sufficient remaining capacity for the item.\n    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    # For valid bins, calculate the 'fill ratio': the proportion of the bin's\n    # current remaining capacity that the item would occupy.\n    # This adaptively prioritizes bins that, upon accommodating the item, achieve\n    # the highest relative utilization, leading to a more compact packing strategy.\n    # A higher ratio indicates a tighter fit relative to the available space,\n    # exploiting the pattern of efficient, high-density placement.\n    # Note: Assumes item > 0.

They implement a \"proportional fill\" heuristic, prioritizing bins where the item consumes the highest ratio of the bin's *remaining* capacity (`item / bins_remain_cap`). This approach, surprisingly ranked highest, suggests that aggressively filling a bin relative to its current emptiness, thereby quickly pushing it towards full utilization or closure, is more effective for this problem than minimizing absolute remaining space or relying on broader utilization bonuses.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), Heuristic 3rd, a complex Best Fit combined with a non-linear bonus for high bin utilization, significantly outperforms Heuristic 4th, which is Best Fit with a simple penalty for tiny remainders. This indicates that a strong, non-linear incentive to achieve very full bins (as in 3rd) is a more potent strategy for overall efficiency than merely discouraging small fragments. The scaling of the bonus by `item` in 3rd also suggests valuing larger items' contribution to bin completion.\n\nComparing (5th) vs (6th), Heuristic 6th, which adds a minor penalty for leaving very small, non-zero remainders on top of Best Fit, performs better than Heuristic 5th, the pure Best Fit. This demonstrates that even subtle improvements like discouraging fragmentation can yield measurable gains over a foundational heuristic, highlighting the importance of managing \"unusable\" leftover space.\n\nComparing (7th) vs (8th), Heuristic 7th, an \"Adaptive Fullness Prioritization\" which explicitly rewards perfect fits and penalizes fragments, is ranked higher than Heuristic 8th, the standard Best Fit. This reinforces that targeted bonuses for perfect fits (leading to full bin closure) and explicit penalties for fragmented space significantly improve packing efficiency beyond simple minimization of remaining capacity.\n\nComparing (9th) vs (10th), Heuristic 9th (identical to 3rd), with its non-linear utilization bonus, outperforms Heuristic 10th (identical to 5th and 8th), the standard Best Fit. This further supports the value of sophisticated, goal-oriented scoring mechanisms over basic heuristics.\n\nComparing (19th) vs (20th), these two are identical and ranked lowest. They return an array of zeros or a constant priority, effectively providing no intelligent guidance for bin selection. Their position at the bottom of the list unequivocally demonstrates that any form of thoughtful prioritization, even a simple Best Fit, is vastly superior to a non-discriminating approach.\n\nOverall: The ranking strongly suggests that for optimal bin packing, heuristics should move beyond simple \"best fit\" to incorporate sophisticated strategies. The best performing heuristics prioritize relative progress towards bin completion (proportional fill) or provide strong, non-linear incentives for achieving high utilization and perfect fits, while also actively managing fragmented space through penalties. Simply returning zeros or a constant value yields the worst performance, underscoring the necessity of intelligent decision-making at each placement step.\n- \n*   **Keywords**: Emergent Complexity, Adaptive Scoring, Probabilistic Selection, High-Dimensional Tuning.\n*   **Advice**: Design heuristics with self-adjusting weights for multi-factor scores based on observed performance.
