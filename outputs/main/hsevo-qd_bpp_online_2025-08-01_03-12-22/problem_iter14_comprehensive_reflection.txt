Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection':

### Redefined 'Current self-reflection'
1.  **Prioritize Core Intuition:** Design around fundamental, domain-specific principles (e.g., minimizing waste) that are inherently effective and interpretable.
2.  **Controlled Refinement:** Incremental additions to heuristic logic must demonstrate measurable, consistent performance gains beyond simpler baselines.
3.  **Focused Discrimination:** Heuristics must provide clear, non-trivial guidance, actively differentiating choices based on the primary optimization objective.
4.  **Parameter Prudence:** Optimize a minimal set of well-understood parameters for robustness; complex, untuned schemes typically underperform.

*   **Keywords:** Core Principles, Simplicity, Validation, Focused Guidance, Parameter Tuning.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics grounded in clear core principles, rigorously validating any added complexity, and precisely tuning minimal parameters for robust optimization.
*   **Avoid:** Generic implementation concerns, unvalidated multi-factor scoring, or vague problem data advice that doesn't translate to specific heuristic logic.
*   **Explanation:** This approach prioritizes effective, interpretable heuristic logic over over-engineered or poorly justified solutions, leading to more reliable and performing systems.
