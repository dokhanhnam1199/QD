Here's the redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Intelligent Bin Closure, Tuned Simplicity, Validated Complexity, Strategic Scoring.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize aggressive bin closure using a refined Best Fit, with non-linear capacity penalties and utilization bonuses. Embrace simple, well-tuned core logic. Introduce complexity only with rigorous performance validation. Ensure choices are strategically discriminating.
*   **Avoid:** Generic software quality discussions as primary design drivers; untuned or unvalidated complexity; heuristics offering non-discriminating choices.
*   **Explanation:** This redefinition provides actionable, performance-centric design principles, focusing on strategic decision-making and disciplined complexity to achieve superior heuristic outcomes.
