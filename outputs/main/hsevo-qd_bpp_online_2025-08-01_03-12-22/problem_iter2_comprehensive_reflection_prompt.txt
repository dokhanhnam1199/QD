{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDesign better heuristics by prioritizing functional correctness, robust handling of edge cases (e.g., items not fitting), and choosing clear mathematical expressions that intuitively align with the objective. Augment with concise, relevant documentation and comments; avoid irrelevant analogies or unnecessary code clutter to enhance readability and maintainability.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
