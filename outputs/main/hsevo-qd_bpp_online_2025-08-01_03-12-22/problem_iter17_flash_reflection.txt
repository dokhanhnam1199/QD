**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (9th), (6th) vs (7th) vs (8th), (12th) vs (17th), (13th) vs (15th), and (14th) vs (16th), we observe that the source code for the functions is *identical* within these ranked groups. This implies that their differences in ranking from best to worst must stem entirely from the specific *default parameter values* chosen, highlighting the paramount importance of hyperparameter tuning for heuristic performance, rather than fundamental algorithmic differences between these identically coded functions.

Comparing (best - 1st) vs (worst - 20th), the 1st heuristic employs a sophisticated, multi-factor scoring combining a non-linear penalty for remaining capacity (`rem_cap_penalty_exponent`) and a bonus for the item's relative size to the bin's current available space (`relative_fill_bonus`). This aggressively favors tight fits and efficient bin utilization. In stark contrast, the 20th heuristic is trivial, returning `np.zeros_like`, effectively assigning equal priority to all bins and offering no strategic guidance for packing, resulting in arbitrary or First Fit-like behavior, explaining its lowest rank.

Comparing (19th - second worst) vs (20th - worst), even though Heuristic 19th is incomplete, its comments and initial structure reveal an intention to combine proportional fill, non-linear high utilization bonuses, and fragmentation penalties. This demonstrates a conceptual attempt at a complex, multi-criteria heuristic, which is inherently more sophisticated than the completely non-discriminatory, zero-priority approach of Heuristic 20th. This difference in design philosophy justifies 19th being ranked above 20th, despite its incompleteness.

Comparing (6th/7th/8th) vs (5th/9th), heuristics 6-8 build upon the "Best Fit" principle (similar to 5th/9th) by explicitly adding a `perfect_fit_bonus`. This strategic bonus incentivizes "closing" bins, which is crucial for efficient packing. Their higher ranking suggests that directly rewarding perfect fits improves performance over a purely linear remaining capacity penalty.

Comparing the top-ranked (1st-4th) with other sophisticated variants like (14th/16th) and (18th), the 1st-4th heuristic's specific combination of a non-linear `rem_cap_penalty_exponent` and a `relative_fill_bonus` appears to be a highly effective formulation. The more complex 18th heuristic, despite its advanced multi-factor, context-sensitive adaptive scoring with probabilistic elements, is ranked very low. This suggests that over-engineering, poorly chosen default parameters, or the introduction of noise can significantly hinder performance in greedy heuristics, where simplicity and well-calibrated core principles often prevail.

Overall, the ranking suggests that a blend of "Best Fit" (minimizing remaining capacity, especially with non-linear penalties), rewarding high relative utilization, and potentially incentivizing bin closure (either directly or implicitly) are key components for high-performing heuristics. Simple, pure strategies (like 10th's basic Best Fit or 12th/17th's pure fill ratio) tend to perform less well than well-tuned hybrid approaches.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristic design prioritizes a refined "Best Fit" principle, employing non-linear penalties for remaining capacity and significant bonuses for high relative bin utilization to promote efficient bin closure. Simplicity, when well-calibrated, often outperforms over-engineered complexity, and robust hyperparameter tuning is paramount for realizing the full potential of any heuristic.
