{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristic design prioritizes a refined \"Best Fit\" principle, employing non-linear penalties for remaining capacity and significant bonuses for high relative bin utilization to promote efficient bin closure. Simplicity, when well-calibrated, often outperforms over-engineered complexity, and robust hyperparameter tuning is paramount for realizing the full potential of any heuristic.\n1.  **Prioritize Simplicity & Tuning:** A simple, well-understood heuristic (e.g., Best Fit) with carefully optimized, fixed parameters is often robust and highly effective.\n2.  **Best Fit is Foundational:** Minimizing remaining capacity after placement is a powerful and reliable principle for bin packing.\n3.  **Validate Complexity:** Added heuristic complexity (dynamic weights, multiple components, stochasticity) must yield clear benefits; otherwise, it risks degrading performance or stability.\n4.  **Strategic Choice Always Beats None:** Any intelligent greedy choice is superior to a flat or random prioritization.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign better heuristics by prioritizing functional correctness, robust handling of edge cases (e.g., items not fitting), and choosing clear mathematical expressions that intuitively align with the objective. Augment with concise, relevant documentation and comments; avoid irrelevant analogies or unnecessary code clutter to enhance readability and maintainability.\n\nDesigning better heuristics demands leveraging problem-specific data to make informed decisions that directly contribute to the optimization objective. A heuristic must intelligently differentiate options; constant or non-discriminating outputs offer no true guidance. Clarity in intent and concise implementation focusing on the core problem are crucial.\n\nSimplicity and clear objectives often yield robust heuristics. Over-engineering with untuned parameters (bonuses, penalties, thresholds) can degrade performance. Effective heuristics must encode problem-specific intelligence, actively guiding decisions towards optimization goals. Trivial or non-strategic approaches are significantly inferior.\n\nDesign better heuristics by embracing dynamic, multi-factor scoring. Prioritize strategies that aggressively close bins (proportional fill, perfect-fit bonuses) and discourage fragmented space. Non-linear rewards for high utilization can be powerful. Parameter tuning is critical for complex heuristics.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
