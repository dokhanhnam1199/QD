**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that Heuristic 1st implements a classic "Best Fit" strategy, prioritizing bins that leave the smallest positive remaining capacity after an item is placed. Its score is simply the negative of the remaining capacity. Heuristic 2nd, while also aiming for "Best Fit," attempts to refine this with an "Adaptive Fullness Prioritization" by adding a strong bonus for perfect fits and a minor penalty for creating small, fragmented remaining capacities. The ranking indicates that the simpler, pure Best Fit (1st) is superior to the more complex adaptive version (2nd). This suggests that the additional strategic considerations (perfect fit bonus, fragment penalty) and their specific parameter values (e.g., bonus=1.0, penalty=0.1, fragment_threshold=0.05) either didn't improve performance or actively hindered it in this context, perhaps by introducing undesirable trade-offs or being poorly tuned.

Comparing (1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 10th) with (2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 9th), we observe that the first group consists of identical "Best Fit" heuristics, while the second group comprises identical "Adaptive Fullness Prioritization" heuristics. The varying ranks within these identical groups (e.g., 1st vs 4th for Best Fit, or 2nd vs 3rd for Adaptive) strongly suggest that the evaluation process might involve elements of randomness (e.g., tie-breaking for equal scores) or multiple test runs, leading to slightly different performance outcomes for functionally identical code. However, the consistent pattern is that the "Best Fit" variants generally rank higher than the "Adaptive Fullness Prioritization" variants.

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), and indeed any of the top-ranked heuristics (Groups A & B) against the bottom-ranked heuristics (Groups C & D, Heuristics 11th-20th), there's a stark contrast. The top-ranked heuristics employ a specific, problem-aware strategy (minimizing remaining capacity, or trying to achieve perfect fits/avoid fragments). In contrast, Heuristics 11th through 20th are functionally identical, simply returning `np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)`. This trivial approach provides no intelligent prioritization, effectively making the bin selection arbitrary (e.g., first fit, or random if ties are broken randomly among zeros). The dramatically lower ranking of these "zero priority" heuristics clearly demonstrates the paramount importance of incorporating even a basic level of problem-specific optimization logic.

Overall: The best-performing heuristics are those that implement a straightforward, well-understood space-optimization strategy like Best Fit. Attempts to introduce more nuanced, rule-based adjustments (like perfect fit bonuses or fragment penalties) can degrade performance if not precisely tuned or if the underlying assumptions don't perfectly align with the problem's dynamics. Heuristics that offer no strategic guidance perform significantly worse.

**Experience:**
Simplicity and clear objectives often yield robust heuristics. Over-engineering with untuned parameters (bonuses, penalties, thresholds) can degrade performance. Effective heuristics must encode problem-specific intelligence, actively guiding decisions towards optimization goals. Trivial or non-strategic approaches are significantly inferior.
