Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

### Redefined Current Self-reflection

*   **Keywords:** Empirical, Iterative, Aligned, Transparent.
*   **Advice:** Rigorously test heuristics' empirical performance on diverse problem sets and edge cases. Ensure all design choices and mathematical logic directly align with the optimization objective. Document design rationale, benchmark results, and trade-offs to facilitate future improvements. Adopt an iterative design process, continuously refining based on performance analysis.
*   **Avoid:** Designing heuristics without empirical validation or diverse test data; employing complex, opaque logic that obscures its alignment with the objective; neglecting to document design decisions, performance metrics, or identified limitations; treating heuristic design as a one-off, static process instead of iterative.
*   **Explanation:** This self-reflection promotes a data-driven, scientific approach to heuristic design, ensuring not just correctness but also practical effectiveness, continuous improvement, and deep understanding across varied problem landscapes.
