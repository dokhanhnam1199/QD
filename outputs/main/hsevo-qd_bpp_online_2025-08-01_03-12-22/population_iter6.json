It aims to:\n\n    1.  **Strongly Reward Perfect Fits**: A perfect fit (leaving 0 remaining capacity)\n        is the most efficient use of space, effectively \"closing\" a bin. This is\n        given a significant bonus.\n    2.  **Prioritize High Overall Utilization**: Similar to Best Fit, bins that\n        become very full after placing the item are generally preferred.\n    3.  **Penalize Fragmented Space**: A minor penalty is applied to bins that\n        are left with a very small, non-zero remaining capacity. Such 'fragments'\n        are often too small to be useful for subsequent items and can lead to\n        wasted space or increased bin count if many such bins accumulate.\n        This encourages the selection of bins that either achieve a perfect fit,\n        or leave a more 'useful' (larger) amount of remaining space, allowing for\n        greater flexibility for future items.\n\n    The goal is to not just minimize residual space, but to do so in a way\n    that minimizes \"unusable\" small fragments, promoting overall\n    packing efficiency and potentially reducing the number of bins.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        BIN_CAPACITY: The maximum capacity of a single bin.
