    As Galileo sought the most elegant and efficient arrangement in the cosmos,
    so too shall we organize our earthly possessions with wisdom. This heuristic,
    akin to the "Best Fit" strategy, is designed to ensure a harmonious and
    dense packing of our bins, minimizing wasted space.

    It calculates a "snugness" score for each potential bin. Bins that allow for
    a perfect fit of the item (leaving no capacity unused) are given the highest
    priority, for they represent the most efficient utilization. Following these,
    priority is given to bins that, after accommodating the item, would possess
    the smallest positive remaining capacity. Bins where the item cannot be
    accommodated at all are wisely relegated to the lowest possible priority,
    preventing futile attempts.

    This ensures that we always choose the existing vessel that most precisely
    accommodates our new piece, akin to how each planet finds its precise,
    efficient orbit.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        A higher score indicates a more preferred bin.

    # Initialize all priorities to a profoundly low value. This ensures that
    # any bin incapable of holding the item is swiftly ignored, much like
    # discarding faulty observational data.
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)

    # Calculate the potential remaining space in each bin should the item be placed there.
    # We are only interested in those scenarios where this value is non-negative,
    # signifying a feasible fit.
    potential_remainders = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Create a celestial mask, indicating only those bins where the item can truly fit.
    fits_mask = potential_remainders >= 0

    # For the bins within this valid celestial sphere (where the item fits),
    # we assign a priority score. To achieve the "best fit" – minimizing the
    # remaining space – we use the negative of the remaining space as our priority.
    # This cunningly makes a perfect fit (remainder 0) the highest score (0),
    # while increasingly larger remainders yield progressively lower (more negative) scores.
    # Thus, selecting the maximum priority score will naturally choose the
    # most snugly fitting bin.
