Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Continuous Scoring, Parameter Calibration, Performance Validation, Objective Alignment.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with continuous, multi-factor scoring functions that non-linearly prioritize efficient resource utilization and bin closure. Meticulously calibrate all parameters to align precisely with the optimization objective, enhancing foundational principles like Best Fit.
*   **Avoid:** Relying on untuned, overly simplistic, or unvalidated complex strategies. Do not conflate basic functional correctness or code clarity with core heuristic performance design principles. Shun non-discriminating or trivial decision rules.
*   **Explanation:** Superior heuristics emerge from rigorously tuned, objective-driven scoring functions, where every component is validated to maximize strategic decision-making and overall system performance.
