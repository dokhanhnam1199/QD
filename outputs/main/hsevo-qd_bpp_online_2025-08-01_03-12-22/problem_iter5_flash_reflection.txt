**Analysis:**
Comparing (best, Heuristic 1st) vs (worst, Heuristic 20th), we observe a fundamental difference in their approach. Heuristic 1st implements a 'Best Fit' strategy, meticulously calculating the remaining capacity after placing an item and prioritizing bins that result in the smallest positive remainder (or a perfect fit of zero remainder). This heuristic actively seeks to minimize wasted space within bins, a core objective in packing problems. Conversely, Heuristic 20th simply returns an array of zeros, effectively giving all bins equal priority. This means it provides no intelligent guidance for selection, leading to arbitrary or first-available placements, and is thus completely ineffective for optimization. Additionally, Heuristic 20th (and other 'worst' ones) include several unused imports (`random`, `math`, `scipy`, `torch`), indicating a lack of focused design.

Comparing (second best, Heuristic 2nd) vs (second worst, Heuristic 19th), the same distinctions hold true. Heuristic 2nd is identical to Heuristic 1st, employing the 'Best Fit' logic, while Heuristic 19th is identical to Heuristic 20th, providing no meaningful priority.

Comparing (1st, Heuristic 1st) vs (2nd, Heuristic 2nd), we see they are identical in every aspect: source code, comments, and docstrings. This pattern repeats for (3rd) vs (4th), and indeed for all consecutive pairs within the top 10 (1st-10th) and within the bottom 10 (11th-20th). This suggests that the ranking within these two major groups is arbitrary, and the significant performance difference lies between the 'Best Fit' heuristic group (1st-10th) and the 'Zero Priority' heuristic group (11th-20th).

Comparing (second worst, Heuristic 19th) vs (worst, Heuristic 20th), again, they are identical. Both are fundamentally flawed heuristics for optimization, returning constant, non-discriminating scores.

Overall: The list clearly distinguishes between a well-designed, goal-oriented heuristic (Best Fit) and a non-functional one. The 'Best Fit' heuristic effectively leverages problem parameters (item size, bin capacity) to minimize unused space, which is a common proxy for optimizing bin usage. The 'Zero Priority' heuristic fails to utilize any problem information, making it effectively useless for achieving an optimal or even a good solution, hence its low ranking. The identical nature of heuristics within their respective ranks highlights that the *strategy* employed by the heuristic is the primary determinant of its effectiveness in this ranking.

**Experience:**
Designing better heuristics demands leveraging problem-specific data to make informed decisions that directly contribute to the optimization objective. A heuristic must intelligently differentiate options; constant or non-discriminating outputs offer no true guidance. Clarity in intent and concise implementation focusing on the core problem are crucial.
