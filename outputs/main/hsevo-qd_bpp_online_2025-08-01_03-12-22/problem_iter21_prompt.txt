Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    item: float,\n    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,\n    base_fit_priority: float = 50.0,\n    rem_cap_penalty_factor: float = 3.5,\n    rem_cap_penalty_exponent: float = 1.7,\n    relative_fill_bonus_factor: float = 8.0,\n    min_allowed_priority: float = 0.5,\n    non_fitting_priority: float = -10.0\n) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function implements a refined \"Best Fit\" strategy, designed to more\n    aggressively prioritize optimal fits and encourage efficient bin utilization.\n    It introduces a non-linear penalty for remaining capacity and a significant\n    bonus for the item's relative size compared to the bin's current available space.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

Meticulously calibrate all parameters to align precisely with the optimization objective, enhancing foundational principles like Best Fit.\n*   **Avoid:** Relying on untuned, overly simplistic, or unvalidated complex strategies. Do not conflate basic functional correctness or code clarity with core heuristic performance design principles. Shun non-discriminating or trivial decision rules.\n*   **Explanation:** Superior heuristics emerge from rigorously tuned, objective-driven scoring functions, where every component is validated to maximize strategic decision-making and overall system performance.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
