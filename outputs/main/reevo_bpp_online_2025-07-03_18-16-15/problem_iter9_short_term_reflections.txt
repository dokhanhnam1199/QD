Prioritize clear, distinct heuristics. Use explicit rules and thresholds instead of complex, scaled functions.

Prioritize snug fits, penalize extreme fills, and reward partially filled bins. Scale with item size.

Focus on exponential penalties for fragmentation, moderate occupancy bonuses, and item-size-dependent prioritization.

Prioritize perfect fits and moderate capacity. Penalize fragmentation and large capacity. Explicitly handle infeasibility.

Simplicity and clear goals improve performance. Focus on fit, fragmentation, and fill level with targeted bonuses/penalties.

Prioritize feasible bins; tune near-fit reward, fragmentation penalty, and randomness scaling to item size.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid extreme fill levels, and reward moderately filled bins proportional to item size.

Reward perfect/near fits greatly, penalize overflow harshly, and control fragmentation with item-size scaling.

Prioritize perfect fits, directly penalize large wasted space, and scale rewards by item size for effective bin packing.

Prioritize perfect fits, scale rewards by item size, and penalize overflow harshly. Refine penalties, and add randomness cautiously.
