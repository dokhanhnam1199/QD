Prioritize perfect/snug fits, moderate fill, and penalize fragmentation/overflow with adaptive item-size bonuses.

Explore non-linear penalties/bonuses, consider occupancy ratios, and scale priority by item size.

Tighter slack penalization, refined fill thresholds, and direct occupancy rewards improve bin packing heuristics.

Smaller slack is better. Exponential penalties on "too full" and "too empty" bins matter. Item size scaling helps.

Sharper penalties, relative scaling, and moderate occupancy rewards are key. Encourage partially filled bins.

Prioritize snug fits, sharply penalize fragmentation, and dynamically scale penalties based on bin capacity.

Focus on feasibility, slack minimization, fragmentation control, adaptive scaling, and good fill levels.

Prioritize snug fits, strongly penalize extreme fills, and moderately reward partially filled bins.

Scale rewards/penalties by item/bin sizes. Exponential penalties for extreme fill levels are effective.

Scale rewards/penalties by item size. Use ratios and exponentials for finer control of bin selection.
