Prioritize snug fits and moderate capacity, penalize fragmentation exponentially, and reward partially filled bins.

Focus on refined penalties, occupancy-based rewards, and dynamically scaled incentives.

Focus on snug fit, fragmentation, and occupied ratio. Item-size adjustments should be refined.

Prioritize snug fits with item size, penalize extreme fills, and reward moderate occupancy for better packing.

Focus on essential fit, fragmentation, and fill-level factors with adaptive scaling based on item size.

The better code uses continuous, scaled priorities, encouraging tight fits and penalizing extreme fill levels with non-linear functions.

Clearer fit & fragmentation handling, simplified penalties/bonuses, and impactful item size adjustment are key.

Focus on smooth, scaled rewards/penalties, feasibility masks, and controlled randomness for exploration.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize extreme fills exponentially, and reward moderate occupancy with bonuses.

Prioritize perfect fits and penalize infeasible allocations heavily. Scale bonuses/penalties by item size and remaining capacity.
