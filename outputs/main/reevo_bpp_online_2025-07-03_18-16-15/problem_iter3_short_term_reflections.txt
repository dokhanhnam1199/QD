Prioritize snug fits, penalize near-full bins, and reward already occupied bins to reduce fragmentation.

Prioritize near-full bins. Penalize wasteful allocations. Use inverse remaining capacity for finer-grained selection among feasible bins.

Prioritize tight fits, prevent near-empty bins, and discourage bins nearing full capacity.

The better code prioritizes bin utilization and avoids near-empty bins, improving packing efficiency.

Prioritize minimal waste using reciprocals. Explore moderate capacity bins. Avoid negative priorities.

The better code uses multiple heuristics: fragmentation avoidance, occupancy bonus, and first-fit decreasing principle.

Prioritize filled bins, penalize waste, and ensure valid bin selection for better online bin packing.

Prioritize perfect fits, minimize wasted space, and explore moderate capacity bins. Avoid excessive penalization.

Combine best-fit, first-fit, and nearly-full bin prioritization with adaptive penalties for unfit items.

The better code focuses on feasibility, minimizes wasted space, and avoids negative priorities for infeasible bins.
