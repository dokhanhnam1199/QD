Focus on: (1) Sharper rewards/penalties, (2) Gaussian-like moderate capacity, (3) Item-size adaptive strategies.

Prioritize tight fits. Penalize fragmentation. Reward partially filled bins, adjusted by item size.

Focus on sharper penalties, moderate capacity preference, and item size adaptation for improved bin utilization.

Normalization, sigmoid functions, and randomness for exploration improve bin packing heuristic performance by balancing exploitation and exploration.

Prioritize perfect fits. Scale rewards by item size. Penalize large waste. Encourage moderate fill.

Prioritize perfect fits. Scale remaining space by item size. Explore moderate capacity bins relative to item size.

Prioritize feasibility, remaining capacity, and controlled penalties/bonuses for near-empty/full bins to improve performance.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, reward nearly-full bins, and adapt penalties based on item size.

Focus on feasibility, minimizing waste, normalization, and avoid complex, hand-tuned heuristics.

Consider fragmentation penalties, occupancy bonuses, item-size influence, and avoid normalization. Prioritize snug fits.
