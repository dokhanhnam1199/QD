Scale rewards/penalties by item size. Employ Gaussian/exponential functions for nuanced preferences. Add small randomness for exploration.

Focus on tight fit, fragmentation, occupancy, and item size adjustments with simpler formulations.

Prioritize perfect fits, scale by item size, and penalize both infeasibility and large capacity gaps.

Prioritize snug fits, penalize extreme fills, and reward partially filled bins while adjusting for item size.

Focus on normalized scores, adaptive penalties, and synergistic heuristic combinations for improved bin packing.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Use Gaussian rewards for target fill levels. Penalize fragmentation sharply.

Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize overflows, manage fragmentation, and add controlled randomness based on item size.

Focus on relative item size, precise fit definitions, and targeted rewards/penalties with clear scaling.

Focus on simple, interpretable metrics like slack and fill ratio, and consider interactions between heuristics.

Sharpen focus: tailor rewards/penalties. Prioritize tight fits, consider bin fill levels, adapt to item size.
