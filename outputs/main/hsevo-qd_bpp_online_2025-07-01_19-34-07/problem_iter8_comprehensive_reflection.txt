Okay, I'm ready to refine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective for designing better heuristics. Let's focus on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a revised definition of "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Nuance, adaptability, problem-specificity, robustness, multi-factor, feasibility, utilization, waste minimization, edge cases, adaptive scaling, non-linear.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that adapt to specific problem characteristics (e.g., item size distribution). Prioritize feasibility, resource utilization, and waste reduction while considering their interdependencies.
*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, inflexible formulas, ignoring edge cases. Don't rely on simple ratios of parameters without considering the broader context.
*   **Explanation:** Strive for nuanced heuristics that combine multiple factors through adaptive and potentially non-linear relationships. Robustly handle edge cases and tailor the heuristic's behavior to the unique aspects of the problem.
