**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic combines gravitational effect, fill factor, and capacity scaling, while the worst only uses the log of ratios of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd) refines (1st) by introducing adjustable `gravity_power` and a `min_capacity` parameter to avoid division by zero. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (2nd) removes `capacity_scaling`. (3rd) is a much more sophisticated heuristic than (4th), as it incorporates feasibility checks, capacity utilization, item fit score, balance factor, remaining capacity penalty, and adaptive scaling based on item size, using a weighted sum of these factors, whereas (4th) implements `gravitational_effect + fill_factor + capacity_scaling`. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we see (3rd) incorporates item size to adaptively scale weights.

Overall: More complex heuristics that consider multiple factors (feasibility, utilization, fit, balance, penalty) and adapt to item size tend to perform better. The gravity metaphor appears consistently in higher-ranked heuristics. The worst-performing heuristics use very simple ratios and logarithms, lacking nuanced considerations. Heuristics that avoid division by zero via `min_capacity` or `epsilon` are more robust.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors, especially feasibility, utilization, and fit. Adapt heuristic behavior based on problem characteristics like item size. Always handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero) to improve robustness.
