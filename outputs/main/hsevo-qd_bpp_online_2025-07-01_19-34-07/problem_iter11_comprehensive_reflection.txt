Here's a refined definition of "Current Self-Reflection" focusing on effective heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor integration, adaptive scaling, edge case handling, problem characteristics, robustness.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by combining relevant factors, adapting their influence (weighting/scaling) based on problem-specific traits. Ensure robustness by addressing potential edge cases.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic calculations, purely linear combinations, disregarding problem context, focusing solely on log ratios.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a nuanced approach. Go beyond simple formulas by adapting factor influence based on problem characteristics and meticulously handling edge cases for robustness.
