Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to focus on effective heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective approaches.

Here's a breakdown to guide better heuristic creation:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Robustness, Edge-case Handling, Problem-Specific.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that integrate multiple relevant factors (feasibility, utilization, fit), and tailor their behavior based on specific problem characteristics (e.g., item size distributions).
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of factors (e.g., solely relying on log ratios). Prioritize a nuanced and contextual approach.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should leverage multiple information sources and adapt based on the problem. Robustness requires handling edge cases.
