Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to guide better heuristic design, avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Nuance, Multifactorial, Non-linear, Holistic, Adaptive.

*   **Advice:** Explore complex, non-linear combinations of factors beyond simple ratios. Prioritize creating a more complete picture of the problem space, incorporating diverse data points.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single transformations (e.g., log ratios) without considering other relevant factors. Rigid formulas; heuristics should adapt based on context.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require understanding interdependencies between factors and crafting adaptive models, not just applying isolated mathematical operations.
