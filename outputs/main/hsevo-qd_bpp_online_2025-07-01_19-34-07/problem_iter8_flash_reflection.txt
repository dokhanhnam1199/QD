**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines gravitational effect, fill ratio, and adaptive capacity scaling, while the worst only uses log ratios of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) exhibits a similar pattern, where the second best heuristic incorporates gravitational effects and fill factors, a more sophisticated approach than simply using log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic uses an adaptive capacity scaling factor in addition to gravitational effect and fill ratio, while the second only uses the first two. (3rd) vs (4th) shows the third uses the same approach as the first, while the fourth incorporates feasibility checks, remaining capacity utilization, waste minimization, and adaptive scaling. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical, only calculating `priorities` using `-log_ratios`. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors, including remaining capacity, item size, and potential waste, often employing non-linear relationships and adaptive scaling. The worse heuristics rely on simpler calculations, such as ratios or log ratios, and lack the nuanced considerations of the better ones. The best heuristics often incorporate a notion of "gravitational effect" or capacity utilization, favoring bins that are already reasonably full and penalizing those that would lead to excessive fragmentation.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors with non-linear relationships and adaptive scaling. Prioritize feasibility, capacity utilization, and waste minimization. Avoid relying on overly simplistic calculations and strive for a nuanced approach that considers the specific characteristics of the problem.
