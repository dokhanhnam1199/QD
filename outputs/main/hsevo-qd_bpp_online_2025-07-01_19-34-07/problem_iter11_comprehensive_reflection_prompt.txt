{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weighting or scaling. Always handle edge cases to prevent errors. Heuristics with more parameters may also perform better.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors and non-linear relationships to create a more nuanced prioritization. Blindly taking log ratios of parameters will often perform worse than incorporating other factors and using a more complex formula. The inclusion of `fill_factor` improved performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors, especially feasibility, utilization, and fit. Adapt heuristic behavior based on problem characteristics like item size. Always handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero) to improve robustness.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors with non-linear relationships and adaptive scaling. Prioritize feasibility, capacity utilization, and waste minimization. Avoid relying on overly simplistic calculations and strive for a nuanced approach that considers the specific characteristics of the problem.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
