Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    This version incorporates multiple factors, non-linear relationships,\n    and adaptive scaling to improve bin packing efficiency.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small constant to avoid division by zero and numerical instability\n\n    # 1.

(2nd) refines (1st) by introducing adjustable `gravity_power` and a `min_capacity` parameter to avoid division by zero. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (2nd) removes `capacity_scaling`. (3rd) is a much more sophisticated heuristic than (4th), as it incorporates feasibility checks, capacity utilization, item fit score, balance factor, remaining capacity penalty, and adaptive scaling based on item size, using a weighted sum of these factors, whereas (4th) implements `gravitational_effect + fill_factor + capacity_scaling`. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we see (3rd) incorporates item size to adaptively scale weights.\n\nOverall: More complex heuristics that consider multiple factors (feasibility, utilization, fit, balance, penalty) and adapt to item size tend to perform better. The gravity metaphor appears consistently in higher-ranked heuristics. The worst-performing heuristics use very simple ratios and logarithms, lacking nuanced considerations. Heuristics that avoid division by zero via `min_capacity` or `epsilon` are more robust.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to focus on effective heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective approaches.\n\nHere's a breakdown to guide better heuristic creation:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Robustness, Edge-case Handling, Problem-Specific.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that integrate multiple relevant factors (feasibility, utilization, fit), and tailor their behavior based on specific problem characteristics (e.g., item size distributions).\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of factors (e.g., solely relying on log ratios). Prioritize a nuanced and contextual approach.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should leverage multiple information sources and adapt based on the problem. Robustness requires handling edge cases.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
