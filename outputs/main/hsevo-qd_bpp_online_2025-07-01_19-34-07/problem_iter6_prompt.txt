Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    Inspired by space-time curvature, we prioritize bins where the\n    item \"bends\" the remaining capacity the most significantly.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Avoid division by zero\n    bins_remain_cap = np.where(bins_remain_cap <= 0, 1e-9, bins_remain_cap)\n\n    # Calculate the \"gravitational effect\" based on item size and remaining capacity.\n    # A larger item has a stronger effect; smaller remaining capacity implies higher urgency.\n    gravitational_effect = item / bins_remain_cap**2 # Inverse square relationship, reminiscent of gravity\n\n    # Introduce a term that favors bins that are reasonably full, but can still accomodate the item.\n    # This prevents premature exhaustion of some bins and promotes better overall packing.\n    fill_factor = (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap)\n    fill_factor = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.inf, fill_factor) #make inelligible when not fitting\n\n    # Combine gravitational effect and fill factor\n    priorities = gravitational_effect + fill_factor\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to focus on effective heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective approaches.\n\nHere's a breakdown to guide better heuristic creation:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Robustness, Edge-case Handling, Problem-Specific.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that integrate multiple relevant factors (feasibility, utilization, fit), and tailor their behavior based on specific problem characteristics (e.g., item size distributions).\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of factors (e.g., solely relying on log ratios). Prioritize a nuanced and contextual approach.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should leverage multiple information sources and adapt based on the problem. Robustness requires handling edge cases.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
