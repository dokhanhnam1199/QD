**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first combines gravitational effect, fill factor, and capacity scaling, while the last only uses the log of the item/capacity ratio. 1st also handles the zero-capacity edge case, while 20th doesn't explicitly. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), 2nd uses gravitational effect, fill ratio, and adaptive capacity scaling while 19th still only uses log ratios and lacks edge case handling. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that 2nd adds a gravity power parameter and an adaptive capacity scaling based on item size and weights the factors while 1st uses simpler capacity scaling. (3rd) vs (4th), 3rd introduces parameters `small_cap_threshold` and `gravity_power` and uses them, while 4th implements sophisticated factors utilization, fit, balance, and penalty with adaptive scaling. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical and implement only a log ratio calculation. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors, often with adaptive scaling or weighting. They also handle edge cases such as division by zero. Simpler heuristics rely on a single factor, such as the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. "Gravitational effect" and "fill factor/ratio" are re-occurring components. Adaptive scaling and edge-case handling also appear to be advantageous.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weighting or scaling. Always handle edge cases to prevent errors. Heuristics with more parameters may also perform better.
