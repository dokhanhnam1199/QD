**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the first heuristic uses a combination of gravitational effect and fill factor to determine priority, while the 11th uses a simple logarithmic ratio. The gravitational effect in the first heuristic prioritizes bins with smaller remaining capacity more strongly and `fill_factor` promotes bins that are reasonably full. The 11th heuristic solely focuses on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. The fill factor aims to prevent prematurely exhausting some bins and promotes better overall packing.

Comparing (2nd) vs (12th), (3rd) vs (13th), ..., they are identical to the first and 11th heuristics, respectively. Therefore, the same analysis applies.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (2nd) vs (3rd), ..., (9th) vs (10th), the functions are identical. This implies that their ranking is based on some factor outside of the function definitions provided (e.g., testing data or integration).

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), (12th) vs (13th), ..., (19th) vs (20th), these functions are also identical. Again, suggesting the ranking is based elsewhere.

Overall: The better performing heuristics calculate priority based on a more complex formula involving division by the square of the remaining capacity and consideration of fill factor. The inferior heuristics only utilize log ratios. The consistent repetition suggests the ranking has more to do with a system outside of the code itself.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors and non-linear relationships to create a more nuanced prioritization. Blindly taking log ratios of parameters will often perform worse than incorporating other factors and using a more complex formula. The inclusion of `fill_factor` improved performance.
