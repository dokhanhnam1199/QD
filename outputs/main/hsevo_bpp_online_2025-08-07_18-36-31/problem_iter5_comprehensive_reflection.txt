- **Keywords**: adaptive scoring, multi‑objective, context‑aware, stochastic diversification, learning‑guided.  
- **Advice**: combine utilization metrics with fragmentation penalties, adjust weightings online via lightweight reinforcement, embed look‑ahead placement and local re‑packing to escape greedy dead‑ends.  
- **Avoid**: relying solely on deterministic monotonic residual‑capacity scores, fixed exact‑fit bonuses, one‑size‑fits‑all parameters, and rigid monolithic code lacking modular hooks.  
- **Explanation**: these shifts give the heuristic flexibility to adapt across diverse bin‑packing patterns, improve overall solution quality, and maintain robustness without over‑fitting to trivial cases.
