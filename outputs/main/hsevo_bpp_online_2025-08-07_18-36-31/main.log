### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prefer deterministic, monotonic scores based on residual capacity, give exact‑fit bonuses, keep code simple and vectorized, and document intent; avoid random or duplicated logic for consistent, high‑quality heuristics.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
    feas = leftover >= 0
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=np.float64)
    priorities[feas] = -leftover[feas]
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority scores for Random Fit bin selection."""
    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores[fit_mask] = np.random.random(fit_mask.sum())
    return scores

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing (best) vs (worst) (Heuristics 1 vs 20), we see the best uses negative leftover (minimizes waste) while the worst uses remaining capacity (maximizes waste), opposite objectives; (second best) vs (second worst) (Heuristics 2 vs 19) adds a large bonus for exact fits to the same negative‑leftover baseline, still opposite to the worst‑fit baseline; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd) (Heuristics 1 vs 2), the second introduces an explicit exact‑fit boost (M) and clearer conditional handling, improving perfect‑match decisions; (3rd) vs (4th) (Heuristics 3 vs 4), both map smaller gaps to higher scores, but the third uses an unbounded inverse (sensitive to tiny gaps) whereas the fourth employs a sigmoid, giving smoother, bounded priorities; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst) (Heuristics 19 vs 20), they are identical worst‑fit implementations, confirming redundancy; Overall, top heuristics are deterministic, vectorized, directly tied to leftover, include exact‑fit bonuses, and have concise documentation, whereas lower‑ranked ones rely on randomness, duplicated code, or ambiguous scoring.
- 
- **Keywords:** deterministic, monotonic, residual capacity, exact‑fit bonus, vectorized, documented, consistent.  
- **Advice:** Build a single, monotonic score from residual capacity; give a small exact‑fit bonus; keep the code vectorized; avoid random tie‑breakers and duplicated logic; fully document intent.  
- **Avoid:** Random tie‑breakers, duplicated logic, non‑deterministic heuristics, over‑complex code.  
- **Explanation:** Determinism cuts variance; monotonicity keeps greedy choices valid; vectorization speeds scoring; documentation simplifies debugging; avoiding randomness and duplication boosts reproducibility and maintainability.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
    feas = leftover >= 0
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=np.float64)
    priorities[feas] = -leftover[feas]
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
- **Keywords:** deterministic, monotonic, residual capacity, exact‑fit bonus, vectorized, documented, consistent.  
- **Advice:** Build a single, monotonic score from residual capacity; give a small exact‑fit bonus; keep the code vectorized; avoid random tie‑breakers and duplicated logic; fully document intent.  
- **Avoid:** Random tie‑breakers, duplicated logic, non‑deterministic heuristics, over‑complex code.  
- **Explanation:** Determinism cuts variance; monotonicity keeps greedy choices valid; vectorization speeds scoring; documentation simplifies debugging; avoiding randomness and duplication boosts reproducibility and maintainability.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!
