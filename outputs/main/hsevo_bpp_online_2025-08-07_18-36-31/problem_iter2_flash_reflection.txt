**Analysis:**  
Comparing (best) vs (worst) (Heuristics 1 vs 20), we see the best uses negative leftover (minimizes waste) while the worst uses remaining capacity (maximizes waste), opposite objectives; (second best) vs (second worst) (Heuristics 2 vs 19) adds a large bonus for exact fits to the same negative‑leftover baseline, still opposite to the worst‑fit baseline; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd) (Heuristics 1 vs 2), the second introduces an explicit exact‑fit boost (M) and clearer conditional handling, improving perfect‑match decisions; (3rd) vs (4th) (Heuristics 3 vs 4), both map smaller gaps to higher scores, but the third uses an unbounded inverse (sensitive to tiny gaps) whereas the fourth employs a sigmoid, giving smoother, bounded priorities; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst) (Heuristics 19 vs 20), they are identical worst‑fit implementations, confirming redundancy; Overall, top heuristics are deterministic, vectorized, directly tied to leftover, include exact‑fit bonuses, and have concise documentation, whereas lower‑ranked ones rely on randomness, duplicated code, or ambiguous scoring.  

**Experience:**  
Prefer deterministic, monotonic scores based on residual capacity, give exact‑fit bonuses, keep code simple and vectorized, and document intent; avoid random or duplicated logic for consistent, high‑quality heuristics.
