{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize a clear, large exact\u2011fit bonus and simple monotonic scoring; avoid over\u2011parameterization and tiny bonuses. Deterministic tie\u2011breaks improve consistency. Simplicity yields more robust bin\u2011packing heuristics.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrefer deterministic, monotonic scores based on residual capacity, give exact\u2011fit bonuses, keep code simple and vectorized, and document intent; avoid random or duplicated logic for consistent, high\u2011quality heuristics.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
