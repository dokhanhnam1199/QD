**Analysis:**  
- **Best vs. Worst (1️⃣ vs. 2️⃣0️⃣):** #1 uses a straightforward `-leftover` score with a huge exact‑fit bonus (1e6), making exact fits dominate. #20 relies on an inverse residual (`1/(1+leftover)`) with a modest exact‑fit boost (10) and a tiny capacity term, yielding weaker, less decisive ordering.  
- **2nd vs. 2nd‑worst (2️⃣ vs. 1️⃣9️⃣):** #2 combines a squared residual penalty, a capacity weight, and an enormous exact‑fit bonus (≈8e9), providing a strong, deterministic preference. #19 mirrors #20’s inverse‑residual scheme but adds a tiny exact‑fit bonus (1e‑6) and index‑based tie‑break, still far less aggressive than #2.  
- **1st vs. 2nd (1️⃣ vs. 2️⃣):** #1 is minimalistic—only `-leftover` plus a large bonus—while #2 adds extra parameters (`w`, `M`) and a quadratic term, increasing complexity without clear benefit. Simplicity of #1 aids robustness.  
- **3rd vs. 4th (3️⃣ vs. 4️⃣):** #3 implements plain best‑fit (`-leftover`). #4 uses an inverse‑leftover (`1/(leftover+ε)`) with an even larger exact‑fit boost (1e7), making near‑fits sharper but introducing non‑linear scaling that can be harder to tune.  
- **2nd‑worst vs. Worst (1️⃣9️⃣ vs. 2️⃣0️⃣):** Both share the inverse‑residual core; #19 adds deterministic tie‑break by index, giving it a slight edge over #20, which lacks any tie‑breaker.  
- **Overall:** The top heuristics prioritize exact fits with a large, clear bonus and employ simple monotonic scoring (negative leftover). As we descend, functions become more complex, use weaker bonuses, and rely on inverse‑residual or added tie‑breaks, which dilute the exact‑fit priority and can hurt performance.

**Experience:**  
Prioritize a clear, large exact‑fit bonus and simple monotonic scoring; avoid over‑parameterization and tiny bonuses. Deterministic tie‑breaks improve consistency. Simplicity yields more robust bin‑packing heuristics.
