{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics should integrate multiple relevant factors and avoid over-parameterization. Prioritizing filling bins almost completely is a strong strategy. Considering future states, though complex, can provide further improvements but comes at the cost of increased complexity.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors to create a more nuanced priority score. Explicitly handle edge cases and provide fallback mechanisms to improve robustness. Favor heuristics that actively try to fill bins and avoid leaving too much space.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
