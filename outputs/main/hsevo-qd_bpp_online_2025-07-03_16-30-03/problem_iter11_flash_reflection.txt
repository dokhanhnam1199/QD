**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers feasibility, remaining space, near-fullness, and penalizes excessive space while the worst only considers the ratio of item to bin size.
*   (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows similar contrast, where the second-best prioritizes near-full bins and penalizes excessive space, encompassing more factors than the ratio-based approach.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic introduces a more refined approach using inverse remaining space, base incentive, and a stronger incentive for bins that are nearly full, along with a penalty for leaving too much space. The 2nd heuristic simplifies this by prioritizing almost full bins based on remaining space, heavily prioritizing bins that become almost full, and penalizing bins with excessive space.
*   (3rd) vs (4th) shows that 3rd heuristic introduces a penalty for excessive remaining space to avoid fragmentation.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both heuristics solely rely on the ratio of item size to bin capacity, and then take the negative log of the ratio. The approach is fundamentally flawed due to lacking feasibility checks or any mechanisms for prioritizing bins.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate feasibility checks, prioritize nearly-full bins, and penalize excessive space to prevent fragmentation. The worst heuristics rely solely on the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity, leading to poor performance. Introduction of tunable hyperparameters does not automatically make the heuristic perform better, as evidenced by the middle ranked heuristics.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize feasibility checks first. Then, create incentives for filling bins as much as possible, focusing on near-full bins while simultaneously penalizing excessive remaining space. Calibrated combinations of different aspects can yield better results than a single metric.
