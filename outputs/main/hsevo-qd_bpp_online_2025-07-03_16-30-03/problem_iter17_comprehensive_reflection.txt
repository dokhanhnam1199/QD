Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." We want actionable advice, not vague statements.

Here's a redefined self-reflection approach:

*   **Keywords:** Efficiency, Penalties, Thresholds, Simplicity, Iteration.
*   **Advice:** Focus on a few key, easily calculated metrics (e.g., remaining space ratio) and use thresholds to trigger specific packing actions (e.g., trying to fill a bin above 90% capacity).
*   **Avoid:** Over-complicating with too many factors or complex lookahead.
*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple, fast heuristic. Systematically analyze failure cases (e.g., bins left with excessive space) and add *targeted* improvements (penalties, thresholds) to address those specific weaknesses, keeping it iterative and measurable.

This aims for a balanced approach: acknowledging the value of multiple factors while emphasizing simplicity and iterative refinement based on observed performance.
