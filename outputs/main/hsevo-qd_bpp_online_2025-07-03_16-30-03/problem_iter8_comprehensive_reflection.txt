Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.

Here's a revised framework for "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, domain knowledge, multi-objective, performance analysis, state anticipation (judiciously).
*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple, interpretable heuristic. Rigorously analyze its performance against representative data. Progressively introduce complexity based *solely* on identified weaknesses.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, over-parameterization, solely focusing on single "bin-filling" objectives, and overly complex future state calculations without demonstrated necessity.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize understanding *why* a heuristic performs poorly before adding complexity. Use domain knowledge to guide refinements, but validate all changes with data analysis. Multi-objective awareness prevents unintended consequences.
