Here's a redefined 'Current Self-Reflection' aimed at generating better bin packing heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Dynamic prioritization, multi-factor scoring, fragmentation, feasibility, future-state awareness, iterative refinement, calibrated thresholds.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust priorities based on bin state (fill level, fragmentation). Use a weighted combination of factors (remaining space, feasibility, near-fullness) but avoid *excessive* parameter tuning. Consider future placements.

*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization, relying on single metrics, ignoring edge cases (no feasible bin), premature complexity.

*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple, multi-factor heuristic focused on filling bins. Iteratively refine it by adding complexity (future-state consideration, fragmentation penalties) only if performance analysis warrants it. Calibrate thresholds carefully. Ensure feasibility checks are always the top priority.
