Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # A bin is feasible if it can accommodate the item\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(feasible_bins):\n        # If no bin can fit, consider using the least-filled bins\n        # (though it won't actually fit). This helps guide decision-making\n        # in extreme cases.

Overall: The better heuristics consider not only remaining space and near-fullness but also future utilization, fit ratio, and penalize excessive space to prevent fragmentation. They may also include a look-ahead strategy by considering hypothetical next item sizes or dynamically adjusting parameters. Introducing tunable parameters helps fine-tune performance.\n- \nOkay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding vague statements.\n\nHere's a redefined approach focusing on *actionable* advice, incorporating analysis, and avoiding ineffective generalities:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Actionable Insights, Quantitative Analysis, Iterative Refinement, Adaptability.\n*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in quantitative analysis of performance bottlenecks. Instrument your existing heuristic to *measure* how frequently specific undesirable states occur (e.g., bins with >X% wasted space). Design targeted adjustments, *quantify* the expected impact of each change, and iterate based on *measured* improvements. This should include automated testing.\n*   **Avoid:** Vague notions like \"consider multiple factors\" without a clear methodology for *how* to select, weight, and validate those factors using data. Stop saying \"anticipate future states\" without concretely defining *how* this is implemented and *measured*.\n*   **Explanation:** Shift from general suggestions to a data-driven, iterative process. Start with a baseline heuristic, *measure* its weaknesses, and then implement focused improvements based on those measurements. Make sure you write tests that demonstrate your expected improvements. This reduces the risk of over-complication and ensures that added complexity translates to tangible gains.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
