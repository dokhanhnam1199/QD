Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd best) vs (2nd worst): The second-best prioritizes near-full bins and penalizes excessive space, while the second-worst also only uses the ratio of item to bin size. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first gives more incentives. (3rd) vs (4th): the third gives a bonus of 1.0 for the feasible bins, while the forth is the same as the first. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate several factors such as remaining space, feasibility, \"almost full\" status, and sometimes penalties for excessive space, using specific thresholds and bonus values tuned to encourage efficient packing and avoid fragmentation. The weaker heuristics often rely solely on item-to-bin ratios, lacking nuanced considerations for bin fullness and packing efficiency. Adding more hyperparameter can make the code be worse. Too many `import` in the bad heuristics.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection.\" We want actionable advice, not vague statements.\n\nHere's a redefined self-reflection approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Efficiency, Penalties, Thresholds, Simplicity, Iteration.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on a few key, easily calculated metrics (e.g., remaining space ratio) and use thresholds to trigger specific packing actions (e.g., trying to fill a bin above 90% capacity).\n*   **Avoid:** Over-complicating with too many factors or complex lookahead.\n*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple, fast heuristic. Systematically analyze failure cases (e.g., bins left with excessive space) and add *targeted* improvements (penalties, thresholds) to address those specific weaknesses, keeping it iterative and measurable.\n\nThis aims for a balanced approach: acknowledging the value of multiple factors while emphasizing simplicity and iterative refinement based on observed performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
