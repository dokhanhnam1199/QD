**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic considers feasibility, remaining space, and near-fullness, while the worst only uses the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no difference. (3rd) vs (4th) shows no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no difference. Comparing (7th) vs (1st) is that, the 7th one added negative reward to bins with excessive space and consider hypothetical items. Overall: the best heuristics combine multiple factors like feasibility, remaining space (prioritizing almost full bins), and sometimes penalizing excessive space or anticipating future item sizes. Simpler heuristics that only focus on a single factor (like item-to-bin ratio) perform worse. Adding many parameters to tune doesn't improve the heuristic.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics should integrate multiple relevant factors and avoid over-parameterization. Prioritizing filling bins almost completely is a strong strategy. Considering future states, though complex, can provide further improvements but comes at the cost of increased complexity.
