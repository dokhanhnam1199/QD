Okay, let's redefine current self-reflection to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor integration, Bin-filling, Look-ahead, Complexity management.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics that aggressively fill bins while intelligently integrating several relevant factors. Explore simplified look-ahead mechanisms if the added complexity is justifiable.
*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization, single-factor reliance, neglecting computational cost.
*   **Explanation:** Aim for a balance. Don't just fill bins blindly, consider other constraints. Don't add look-ahead if it slows down the search drastically. Multi-factor integration should be streamlined.
