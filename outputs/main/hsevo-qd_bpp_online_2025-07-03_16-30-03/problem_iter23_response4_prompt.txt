Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # A bin is feasible if it can accommodate the item\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(feasible_bins):\n        # If no bin can fit, consider using the least-filled bins\n        # (though it won't actually fit).

The worst heuristic only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity using a logarithmic scale.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), the second best heuristic still contains most of the components that the best heuristic includes (feasibility, remaining space, utilization target). Second worst also only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity using a logarithmic scale.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), both heuristics prioritize almost full bins and penalize bins where the item fits by only a tiny amount. However, the 4th heuristic introduces a penalty for excessive remaining space and attempts a limited look-ahead by considering hypothetical next item sizes.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Overall: The best heuristics involve a multifaceted approach, dynamically adapting to bin fill levels and considering future item placements. They prioritize near-full bins, penalize excessive space, and incorporate elements of look-ahead. Simpler heuristics that only consider the ratio of item size to bin capacity perform the worst. Introducing adaptive thresholds and penalties based on remaining space and bin utilization improves performance. Adding a look-ahead mechanism seems to be a good improvement.\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current Self-Reflection' aimed at generating better bin packing heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Dynamic prioritization, multi-factor scoring, fragmentation, feasibility, future-state awareness, iterative refinement, calibrated thresholds.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust priorities based on bin state (fill level, fragmentation). Use a weighted combination of factors (remaining space, feasibility, near-fullness) but avoid *excessive* parameter tuning. Consider future placements.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization, relying on single metrics, ignoring edge cases (no feasible bin), premature complexity.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple, multi-factor heuristic focused on filling bins. Iteratively refine it by adding complexity (future-state consideration, fragmentation penalties) only if performance analysis warrants it. Calibrate thresholds carefully. Ensure feasibility checks are always the top priority.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
