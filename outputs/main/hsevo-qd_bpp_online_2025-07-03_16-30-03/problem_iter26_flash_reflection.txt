**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical; (3rd) vs (4th), the 4th one introduces the concept of `fit_ratio` to fine-tune space priority and penalizes wasteful bins and look-ahead with dynamic mean item size consideration; Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the 1st considers future utilization; (2nd) vs (5th), the 2nd considers future utilization while the 5th penalizes excessive space and heavily prioritizes near full bins; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst prioritizes almost full bins while the worst prioritizes feasible bins; Comparing (6th) vs (7th), the 6th considers "hypothetical" next item sizes; Comparing (8th) vs (9th), the 8th has moderate priority boost for bins that aren't "almost full" but still have relatively little space left and a penalty for bins that are too empty; Comparing (10th) vs (11th), the 10th penalizes bins with excessive space and gives a base reward for feasible bins; Comparing (12th) vs (13th), 13th has more tunable parameters; Comparing (14th) vs (15th), the 15th one combines remaining space, feasibility, and near-fullness for priority; Comparing (16th) vs (17th), the 16th introduces `excessive_space_threshold` and `excessive_space_penalty`. Overall: The better heuristics consider not only remaining space and near-fullness but also future utilization, fit ratio, and penalize excessive space to prevent fragmentation. They may also include a look-ahead strategy by considering hypothetical next item sizes or dynamically adjusting parameters. Introducing tunable parameters helps fine-tune performance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider not only current state but also the potential future states. Penalizing undesirable states is useful. Adding tunable parameters to control the influence of different factors can improve adaptability.
