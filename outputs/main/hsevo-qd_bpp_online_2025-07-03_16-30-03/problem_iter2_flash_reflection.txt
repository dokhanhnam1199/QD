**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the better heuristic prioritizes almost-full bins, provides a fallback mechanism when no bin can fit the item, and incorporates multiple factors (remaining space, feasibility, near-fullness) into its priority calculation. The worse heuristic only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity using a log scale.
Comparing (2nd) vs (12th), the logic is the same as (1st) vs (11th).
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), no differences found. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), no differences found. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), no differences found.
Overall: The better heuristics involve more complex calculations considering multiple factors such as remaining space, whether the item fits, and a bonus for almost-full bins, while the worse ones rely on a single ratio. The top heuristics include specific logic to handle edge cases where no bin can fit the item.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors to create a more nuanced priority score. Explicitly handle edge cases and provide fallback mechanisms to improve robustness. Favor heuristics that actively try to fill bins and avoid leaving too much space.
