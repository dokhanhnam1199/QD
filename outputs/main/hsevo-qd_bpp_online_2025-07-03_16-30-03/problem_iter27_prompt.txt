Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(feasible_bins):\n        priorities = -bins_remain_cap\n        return priorities\n    \n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Adaptive weight for remaining space: Emphasize smaller remaining space less as bins fill up\n    space_priority = 1 / (remaining_space + 1e-9)\n    \n    # Calculate bin utilization: how full is the bin *after* placing the item?\n    future_utilization = (bins_remain_cap - remaining_space) / (bins_remain_cap + item) #Original capacity of bin assumed to be bins_remain_cap + item before placing the item\n\n    # Prioritize bins that will be moderately full to avoid fragmentation\n    utilization_priority = np.exp(-((future_utilization - 0.7)**2) / 0.05) # Gaussian-like curve centered around 0.7\n\n    priorities[feasible_bins] = space_priority[feasible_bins] + utilization_priority[feasible_bins]\n    \n    # Dynamic adjustment: As bins fill, be more aggressive about nearly full bins\n    fill_threshold = np.mean(bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins]) # Adaptive threshold\n    almost_full = np.logical_and(feasible_bins, remaining_space < 0.1 * fill_threshold) # Dynamic percentage of mean\n    priorities[almost_full] += 10.0  # Increased emphasis\n\n    # Limited look-ahead: Penalize bins if the remaining space will be less than the mean of items\n    # This attempts to anticipate the need for a suitable bin for an average-sized item later.\n    mean_remaining_item_size = item # Assume current item size is a good proxy.\n    look_ahead_penalty = np.logical_and(feasible_bins, remaining_space < mean_remaining_item_size)\n    priorities[look_ahead_penalty] -= 2.0\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding vague statements.\n\nHere's a redefined approach focusing on *actionable* advice, incorporating analysis, and avoiding ineffective generalities:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Actionable Insights, Quantitative Analysis, Iterative Refinement, Adaptability.\n*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in quantitative analysis of performance bottlenecks. Instrument your existing heuristic to *measure* how frequently specific undesirable states occur (e.g., bins with >X% wasted space). Design targeted adjustments, *quantify* the expected impact of each change, and iterate based on *measured* improvements. This should include automated testing.\n*   **Avoid:** Vague notions like \"consider multiple factors\" without a clear methodology for *how* to select, weight, and validate those factors using data. Stop saying \"anticipate future states\" without concretely defining *how* this is implemented and *measured*.\n*   **Explanation:** Shift from general suggestions to a data-driven, iterative process. Start with a baseline heuristic, *measure* its weaknesses, and then implement focused improvements based on those measurements. Make sure you write tests that demonstrate your expected improvements. This reduces the risk of over-complication and ensures that added complexity translates to tangible gains.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
