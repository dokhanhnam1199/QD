{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors and constraints. Penalties and incentives can provide a more nuanced approach. Anticipating future states can lead to better long-term performance.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors to create a more nuanced priority score. Explicitly handle edge cases and provide fallback mechanisms to improve robustness. Favor heuristics that actively try to fill bins and avoid leaving too much space.\n\nEffective heuristics should integrate multiple relevant factors and avoid over-parameterization. Prioritizing filling bins almost completely is a strong strategy. Considering future states, though complex, can provide further improvements but comes at the cost of increased complexity.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple relevant factors and domain-specific knowledge. Penalizing undesirable outcomes (e.g., excessive space) and anticipating future states can significantly improve performance. Start with a simple heuristic and iteratively refine it by adding complexity based on performance analysis.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize feasibility checks first. Then, create incentives for filling bins as much as possible, focusing on near-full bins while simultaneously penalizing excessive remaining space. Calibrated combinations of different aspects can yield better results than a single metric.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
