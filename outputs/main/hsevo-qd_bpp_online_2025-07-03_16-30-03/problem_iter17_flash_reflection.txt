**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers remaining space, feasibility, and near-fullness, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity using logarithms. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst): The second-best prioritizes near-full bins and penalizes excessive space, while the second-worst also only uses the ratio of item to bin size. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first gives more incentives. (3rd) vs (4th): the third gives a bonus of 1.0 for the feasible bins, while the forth is the same as the first. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate several factors such as remaining space, feasibility, "almost full" status, and sometimes penalties for excessive space, using specific thresholds and bonus values tuned to encourage efficient packing and avoid fragmentation. The weaker heuristics often rely solely on item-to-bin ratios, lacking nuanced considerations for bin fullness and packing efficiency. Adding more hyperparameter can make the code be worse. Too many `import` in the bad heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing packing heuristics, consider multiple factors beyond simple ratios. Prioritize near-full bins, penalize excessive space, and use carefully tuned thresholds to encourage efficient packing. Avoid over-complicating the heuristics with unnessecary hyperparameters and libraries.
