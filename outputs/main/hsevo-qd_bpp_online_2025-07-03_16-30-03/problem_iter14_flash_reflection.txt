**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first one includes logic for feasible bins, nearly full bins, excessive space, and anticipating future placements, while the 20th only calculates the negative log of the item/bin ratio. This suggests the importance of considering multiple factors and constraints. (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see 2nd includes incentives to fill bins. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see 1st considers hypothetical next item sizes. (3rd) vs (4th), we see 3rd has a moderate priority boost for bins that aren't "almost full." Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see 19th includes logic for Prioritize almost full bins based on remaining space. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple incentives and penalties related to bin feasibility, remaining space, near-fullness, excessive space, and even anticipation of future placements, whereas the worse heuristics consider a single factor or a simplistic calculation. Adding more hyper-parameters does not improve the performance of the heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors and constraints. Penalties and incentives can provide a more nuanced approach. Anticipating future states can lead to better long-term performance.
