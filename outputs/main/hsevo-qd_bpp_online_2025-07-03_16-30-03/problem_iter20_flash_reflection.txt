Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided heuristics and offer advice for designing better ones.

**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates multiple factors (remaining space, feasibility, almost-fullness, and a penalty for leaving too much space), while the worst simply uses the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. This suggests that combining multiple relevant factors leads to better performance.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the second best uses a combination of factors similar to the best, including prioritizing almost full bins, prioritizing bins with smaller remaining space, and penalizing bins that are too empty.  The second worst, heuristic (19th), is almost identical to heuristics (18th), both use the negative log ratios of item/bin size but only on bins that are feasible but not nearly full (which is a decent feature, but not enough).
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see a difference in how the "almost full" condition is handled, and the explicit bonus/penalty amounts. The first heuristic uses a threshold of `remaining_space < 0.2` for "almost full" and assigns a bonus of `3.0`, and also includes a small penalty for bins with too much space (`remaining_space > 0.5`). The second uses `remaining_space < 0.1` and assigns a much higher bonus of `10.0`, and a smaller penalty for full bins of `bins_remain_cap > 0.7`.

(3rd) vs (4th) ... Heuristic 3rd and 2nd are identical, Heuristic 4 prioritizes almost full bins based on remaining space (`1 / (remaining_space + 1e-9)`) and adds 5.0 if almost full. Penalties excessive space by subtracting `0.5 * remaining_space`. Also gives a base reward of 0.6 for feasible bins. These are all good features but with different weight/implementation.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that 19th heuristics are identical to heuristics 18th, and heuristic 20th only uses  `-log_ratios` which is the worst one.

Overall: The top-performing heuristics prioritize a combination of factors. The most common and effective components seem to be:

*   **Feasibility:** Ensuring the item fits in the bin.
*   **Remaining Space:** Preferring bins where the item fits with minimal wasted space (using inverse remaining space).
*   **Almost Full:** Giving a significant bonus to bins that are nearly full after adding the item. This encourages closing out bins.
*   **Penalties for excessive space/fragmentation:** Discouraging leaving large empty spaces, which can hinder future placements.
*   **Handling Infeasible Cases:** Deciding what to do when no bin can accommodate the item (e.g., using the least filled bin).

The heuristics that only consider one or two factors, or that use less refined methods for calculating priority, perform worse. The specific values assigned to bonuses and penalties also appear to have a significant impact. Heuristics that perform well explicitly handle the "almost full" condition by providing very high priority and penalize leaving excessive space.

**Experience:**

When designing bin packing heuristics, combine multiple factors, especially remaining space, feasibility, near-fullness, and fragmentation penalties. Carefully tune the weights and thresholds for each factor through experimentation. Explicitly handle cases where no feasible bin exists. Prioritize filling bins almost completely.
