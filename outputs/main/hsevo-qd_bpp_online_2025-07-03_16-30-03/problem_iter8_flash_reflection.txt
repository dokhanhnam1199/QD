**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates several factors including remaining space, feasibility, near-fullness, a penalty for excessive space, and even anticipation of future item sizes, while the worst only considers the ratio of the item size to the remaining bin capacity using a negative log scale.
(2nd best) vs (second worst) - 2nd and 3rd functions in list are the same. comparing with 19th, we see the second best heuristic incorporates several factors including remaining space, feasibility, near-fullness while the second worst only considers the ratio of the item size to the remaining bin capacity using a negative log scale.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best introduces a penalty for excessive space and anticipates future placements, whereas the second prioritizes based on remaining space and near-fullness without considering these factors.
(3rd) vs (4th), the third is identical to the second. The fourth adds a penalty for excessive space.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the functions are identical, both only calculating priorities based on the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.
Overall: Better heuristics consider more factors, prioritize filling nearly full bins, and penalize leaving excessive space. The best attempts to anticipate future item sizes. Simpler heuristics that only consider ratio of item/bin capacity perform the worst. Inclusion of domain-specific knowledge/constraints improves the heuristic.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple relevant factors and domain-specific knowledge. Penalizing undesirable outcomes (e.g., excessive space) and anticipating future states can significantly improve performance. Start with a simple heuristic and iteratively refine it by adding complexity based on performance analysis.
