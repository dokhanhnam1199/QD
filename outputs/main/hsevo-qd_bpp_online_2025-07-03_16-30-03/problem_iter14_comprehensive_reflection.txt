Okay, I will refine "Current self-reflection" to provide more actionable advice for designing better heuristics, while actively avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection". Here's the breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted, Iterative refinement, Predictive modeling, Constraint handling.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by considering diverse factors. Implement penalties/incentives dynamically based on observed performance. Iteratively refine by adding complexity only if justified by performance gains. Use predictive modeling to anticipate future consequences of current decisions.
*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization, rigid "filling" strategies (near-full focus), premature optimization.
*   **Explanation:** A robust heuristic balances multiple objectives, learns from its mistakes (dynamic penalties), and incorporates future state prediction judiciously, all while avoiding unnecessary complexity that hinders adaptability and generalization.
