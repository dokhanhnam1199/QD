Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into something more actionable for heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility-first, Incentive-driven, Bin utilization, Calibrated combination.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize initial feasibility validation. Then, design incentives for near-optimal bin filling based on a weighted combination of factors (e.g., space remaining, number of items).

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex lookahead or excessive parameters early on. Don't solely rely on penalizing empty space without rewarding near-full bins.

*   **Explanation:** Begin with fundamental feasibility rules. Subsequently, construct a weighted incentive system focused on *achieving* near-full bins, not just avoiding empty ones. Calibrate the weights through experimentation.
