Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, keeping in mind what to avoid, and focusing on actionable advice:

*   **Keywords:** Integration, Robustness, Bin-Packing, Edge-Case Handling.

*   **Advice:** Develop heuristics that synthesize multiple relevant features into a composite score. Implement explicit checks and alternative strategies for boundary conditions. Design heuristics that proactively minimize wasted space.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single factors; ignoring extreme scenarios; passively accepting fragmentation.

*   **Explanation:** Combining factors creates more informed choices, robustness ensures consistent performance, and active bin-packing increases efficiency.
