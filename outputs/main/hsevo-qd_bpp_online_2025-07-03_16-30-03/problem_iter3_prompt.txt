Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # A bin is feasible if it can accommodate the item\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if not np.any(feasible_bins):\n      # If no bin can fit, consider using the least-filled bins \n      # (though it won't actually fit).

Implement explicit checks and alternative strategies for boundary conditions. Design heuristics that proactively minimize wasted space.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single factors; ignoring extreme scenarios; passively accepting fragmentation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Combining factors creates more informed choices, robustness ensures consistent performance, and active bin-packing increases efficiency.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
