Okay, here's a redefined approach to "Current Self-Reflection" focused on avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective Self-Reflection" examples, designed to improve your heuristic design process, aiming for that $999k tip!

*   **Keywords:** Factor Prioritization, Adaptive Weights, Regret Analysis, Look-Ahead (Limited).

*   **Advice:** Prioritize factors dynamically based on problem state (e.g., more emphasis on fragmentation later). Use adaptive weights to allow factors to adjust to problem instances. Incorporate a limited look-ahead mechanism to estimate the impact of each placement on future decisions.

*   **Avoid:** Over-tuning, reliance on fixed thresholds, excessive complexity from deep look-ahead searches, and premature optimization of every near-full bin.

*   **Explanation:** Instead of rigidly combining factors and hoping tuning works, focus on *why* certain factors are important *at specific stages* of the packing process. Look-ahead isn't about solving the *whole* problem but glimpsing immediate downstream effects. Adaptive weights adjust to different problem instances and reduce the burden of tuning.
