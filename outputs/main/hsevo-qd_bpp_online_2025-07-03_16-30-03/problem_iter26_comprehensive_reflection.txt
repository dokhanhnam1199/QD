Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding vague statements.

Here's a redefined approach focusing on *actionable* advice, incorporating analysis, and avoiding ineffective generalities:

*   **Keywords:** Actionable Insights, Quantitative Analysis, Iterative Refinement, Adaptability.
*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in quantitative analysis of performance bottlenecks. Instrument your existing heuristic to *measure* how frequently specific undesirable states occur (e.g., bins with >X% wasted space). Design targeted adjustments, *quantify* the expected impact of each change, and iterate based on *measured* improvements. This should include automated testing.
*   **Avoid:** Vague notions like "consider multiple factors" without a clear methodology for *how* to select, weight, and validate those factors using data. Stop saying "anticipate future states" without concretely defining *how* this is implemented and *measured*.
*   **Explanation:** Shift from general suggestions to a data-driven, iterative process. Start with a baseline heuristic, *measure* its weaknesses, and then implement focused improvements based on those measurements. Make sure you write tests that demonstrate your expected improvements. This reduces the risk of over-complication and ensures that added complexity translates to tangible gains.
