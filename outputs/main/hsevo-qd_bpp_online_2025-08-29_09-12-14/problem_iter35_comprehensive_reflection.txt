Okay, let's distill these reflections into actionable advice for designing better heuristics. Given the potential reward, a thorough, step-by-step approach is crucial!

**Keywords:** Waste Minimization, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness, Feasibility.

**Advice:** Focus on *relative* waste – how well an item fits *compared to its size* within a bin. Combine inverse waste with exponential weighting *before* normalization to a probability distribution. Prioritize calculations *only* on feasible bins.

**Avoid:** Normalizing before weighting, direct use of remaining capacity without item size context, overly complex "worst-fit" logic, and unnecessary computations/parameters. Division-by-zero errors are critical failures.

**Explanation:** The core pattern is prioritizing tighter fits (lower *relative* waste) via exponential weighting. Normalization *after* weighting ensures stable probabilistic selection. Robustness—handling edge cases & preventing numerical instability—is paramount for real-world performance & scalability.
