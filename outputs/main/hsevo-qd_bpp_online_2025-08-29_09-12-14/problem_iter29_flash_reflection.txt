**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both utilize exponential weighting with inverse waste, but the 1st uses `item + 1e-6` in the denominator for normalization, potentially avoiding issues with `item` being zero and offering smoother weighting.  The 2nd uses `min_waste + 1e-6`, which is more sensitive to the smallest waste value.

Comparing 2nd vs 3rd, the 3rd calculates relative waste directly without a `min_waste` reference, making it potentially less stable and reliant on the absolute waste values.

Comparing 3rd vs 4th, the 4th normalizes only the feasible bins' priorities, which is better practice than normalizing all priorities including those of infeasible bins, as seen in the 3rd.

Comparing 4th vs 5th, the 5th normalizes over *all* priorities again, losing the benefit of focusing on feasible bins.

Heuristics 6th is essentially identical to 4th.

Comparing 7th vs 8th, the 8th is simpler, only using the distance (waste) in the exponential. The 7th attempts to incorporate relative waste into the exponential, but also divides by `relative_waste + 1e-6`, which can be unstable.

Comparing 8th vs 9th, the 9th also uses relative waste directly in the exponential, lacking the smooth weighting of the 8th.

Heuristics 10th, 11th, and 12th are identical; they implement a simple inverse waste prioritization. 

Heuristics 13th includes unnecessary imports and lacks clear prioritization logic beyond checking feasibility.

Heuristics 14th calculates relative fitness as waste/item and applies exponential weighting, but is less elegant than earlier approaches.

Heuristics 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th generally devolve into simpler or incorrect approaches.  16th, 17th and 18th attempt inverse waste/relative waste with varying degrees of correctness, but lack the smoothing of the exponential weighting.  The final heuristic (20th) is a basic approach that returns priorities based on worst-fit capacities.

Overall: The strongest heuristics (1st-8th) focus on exponential weighting of inverse waste. Normalizing only over feasible bins is advantageous. Simpler approaches (10th-12th) lack nuance and are less effective.  Later heuristics show a decreasing understanding of proper prioritization.

**Experience:**

Prioritize smoothing functions (like exponential weighting) over direct calculations when dealing with waste. Focus normalization efforts on feasible solutions, avoiding dilution with infeasible options. Simplicity isn't always best; robust handling of edge cases (zero item size) is crucial.
