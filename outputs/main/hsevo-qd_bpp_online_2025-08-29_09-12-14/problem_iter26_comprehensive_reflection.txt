Okay, let's distill this into actionable advice for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Waste minimization, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize relative waste (waste *relative to item size*). Combine inverse waste with exponential weighting *before* normalization to a probability distribution for bin selection. Focus on rewarding "good fits," not penalizing "bad" ones.
* **Avoid:** Absolute remaining capacity, negative priorities, unnecessary complexity, identifying "worst" fits, redundant calculations, and numerical instability (division by zero).
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren't about complex rules; theyâ€™re about consistently rewarding better solutions (tighter fits). Normalization & weighting ensure fair comparisons & prevent dominance by outliers, leading to stable, scalable performance.
