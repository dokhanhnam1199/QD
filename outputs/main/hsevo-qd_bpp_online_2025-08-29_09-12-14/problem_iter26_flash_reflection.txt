**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st and 2nd, both aim to prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, but the 1st version simply returns zeros, rendering it useless. The 2nd version introduces a basic inverse waste calculation (1/(remaining_capacity - item)). This is a step in the right direction, but lacks normalization.

Comparing 2nd and 3rd, the 3rd refines the 2nd by explicitly filtering for `possible_bins` (where `bins_remain_cap >= item`), improving efficiency and clarity. It then normalizes the priorities, ensuring they sum to 1, which is crucial for probabilistic selection.  Both employ exponential weighting on the waste, but the 3rd focuses solely on viable bins, which is good practice.

Heuristics 3rd and 4th are identical.

Comparing 4th/3rd with 5th, the 5th introduces 'relative waste' (waste/item) which is beneficial for scaling the waste value depending on item size. However, it has a slightly different normalization strategy, adding a small value (1e-8) to the sum of priorities. This avoids division by zero but is functionally similar to dividing by the sum.

Comparing 5th and 6th, the 6th version enhances the scoring by including `1e-6` in the denominator of the exponential term, further preventing potential division-by-zero errors. The inverse relative waste combined with the exponential weighting provides a more robust scoring.

Heuristics 7th and 8th are very similar and quite basic, implementing the inverse waste calculation but lacking the exponential smoothing and normalization of better heuristics.

Heuristics 9th, 11th, and 12th are also similar to 7th/8th.

Comparing 10th to others, the pre-scaling of the 'relative waste' by 5 in `np.exp(-5 * relative_waste)` affects the steepness of the exponential decay. This can be beneficial, but the optimal scaling factor is problem-dependent.

Heuristics 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th introduce varying degrees of sophistication but generally lack the robustness and efficiency of the top-ranked heuristics. 15th and 16th attempt to use a temperature parameter and exponential weighting with probabilities, but are computationally heavier.  18th and 19th are improvements but still less elegant than the top heuristics.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st-6th) prioritize efficient calculation of waste, exponential weighting to favor tighter fits, and proper normalization for probabilistic bin selection. Avoiding division by zero and focusing computation only on viable bins are key. The lower-ranked heuristics are either overly simplistic, redundant, or introduce unnecessary complexity.



**Experience:**

Prioritize calculations only on feasible bins and normalize priority scores to ensure probabilistic selection. Exponential weighting, combined with inverse waste, significantly improves performance. Simple is often better â€“ avoid unnecessary computations or parameters.
