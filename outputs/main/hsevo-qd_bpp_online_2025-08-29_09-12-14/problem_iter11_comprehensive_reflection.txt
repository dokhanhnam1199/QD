Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design guidance, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a breakdown, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Waste Minimization, Probabilistic Selection, Exponential Weighting, Numerical Stability
* **Advice:** Focus on *relative* waste – prioritize bins minimizing waste *considering item size*. Implement exponential weighting of waste for nuanced exploration/exploitation. Normalize bin fit scores to probabilities.
* **Avoid:** Absolute capacity checks, negative priorities, unnecessary complexity, and redundant calculations. Don’t fixate on finding a single "worst" fit.
* **Explanation:** Successful heuristics aren't about perfect fits, but consistently *better* choices. Probabilistic selection guided by exponentially weighted waste, alongside robust error handling, leads to scalable, reliable performance.
