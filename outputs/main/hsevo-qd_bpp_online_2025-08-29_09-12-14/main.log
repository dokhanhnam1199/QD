### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Effective bin-packing heuristics prioritize minimizing waste. Inverse waste calculations, potentially with exponential weighting, consistently outperform approaches that don't explicitly address bin fit. Avoid unnecessary imports and negative priority assignments; focus on relative prioritization *between* valid bins to drive better packing decisions.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.sum(valid_bins) == 0:
        return priorities
    
    remaining_capacities = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]
    
    waste = remaining_capacities - item
    
    priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 / (waste + 1e-6)
    
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(possible_bins):
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    bin_fits = bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item
    exp_fits = np.exp(bin_fits / (item + 1e-6))
    sum_exp_fits = np.sum(exp_fits)
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities[possible_bins] = exp_fits / sum_exp_fits
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing `priority_v2` in the 1st heuristic vs. the 20th, we see the 1st prioritizes bins based on the inverse of remaining capacity minus the item size, effectively favoring tighter fits. The 20th does the same, but also assigns -1 to invalid bins, which doesn't contribute to prioritization *between* valid bins.  Comparing the 2nd vs. the 19th, both calculate waste, but the 2nd only prioritizes valid bins, while the 19th assigns -1 to invalid bins—similar to the 20th—and offers no relative prioritization amongst the valid bins. 

Comparing 1st vs. 2nd, both use `1/(waste + 1e-6)` but the 2nd calculates `waste` more efficiently. Comparing 3rd vs. 4th, they are almost identical. Comparing 6th vs 7th, identical.  Comparing 8th/9th vs. the others, 8th/9th introduce an exponential weighting, promoting bins with larger remaining capacity slightly more aggressively than the simple inverse waste approach. The use of the exponential function is a key difference.  Heuristics 11th, 12th, and 13th import unnecessary libraries and are essentially empty or incomplete implementations. The 16th uses `np.exp` in a different way, but doesn't seem particularly effective. The 17th attempts to prioritize by remaining capacity/item size, potentially leading to instability. 18th is flawed – it identifies *a* worst bin but doesn't use this information effectively. The addition of -1 to invalid bins in 19th and 20th doesn’t contribute to good bin selection.

Overall, the best heuristics (1st-9th) focus on prioritizing bins with minimal waste, either directly (inverse waste) or with a more nuanced weighting (exponential). The poorer heuristics either lack meaningful prioritization logic, introduce unnecessary complexity (imports), or have flawed implementations. A critical element is handling invalid bins - simply marking them doesn't help in selecting the *best* valid bin.

Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design principles – aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Waste minimization, Relative prioritization, Bin fit, Exponential weighting.
* **Advice:** Explicitly model & optimize for *remaining* bin space. Prioritize bins based on how well the *next* item fits, not absolute capacity. Explore exponentially weighting tighter fits.
* **Avoid:** Absolute thresholds, negative prioritization, focusing on *filling* bins rather than minimizing wasted space.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics succeed by quickly finding *good enough* solutions. Focusing on relative improvements (best fit *next*) and directly tackling waste yields faster convergence to higher-quality packings than complex, absolute rules.





Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    bin_count = len(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities = np.zeros(bin_count)
    for i in range(bin_count):
        if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:
            priorities[i] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + 0.0001)
        else:
            priorities[i] = 0.0
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:

Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design principles – aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Waste minimization, Relative prioritization, Bin fit, Exponential weighting.
* **Advice:** Explicitly model & optimize for *remaining* bin space. Prioritize bins based on how well the *next* item fits, not absolute capacity. Explore exponentially weighting tighter fits.
* **Avoid:** Absolute thresholds, negative prioritization, focusing on *filling* bins rather than minimizing wasted space.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics succeed by quickly finding *good enough* solutions. Focusing on relative improvements (best fit *next*) and directly tackling waste yields faster convergence to higher-quality packings than complex, absolute rules.





Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

import numpy as np

def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

        else:
            priorities[i] = 0.0
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
