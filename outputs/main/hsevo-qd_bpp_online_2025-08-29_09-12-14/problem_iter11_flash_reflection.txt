**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical code. This suggests redundancy and potential lack of experimentation. (1st/2nd) vs (3rd), the top heuristics utilize exponential weighting and normalization based on waste, while (3rd) simply returns zeros. (3rd) and (4th) have `priority_v1` functions which are ineffective. Comparing (4th) vs (5th), (6th) and (7th) exhibit similar logic – calculating inverse waste – but (7th) introduces a flawed attempt at finding the "worst" fit, which isn't properly utilized and could disrupt the prioritization. (8th) and (9th) and (10th) are nearly identical and attempt exponential weighting as well. (11th) uses a waste/item ratio. (12th), (13th), (14th), (15th), (16th), (17th), (18th), (19th) and (20th) have a baseline function `priority_v1` that returns zeros. Comparing (18th) and (20th) there is redundant code, they both return the worst fit capacities. Comparing (19th) and (20th), they both attempt to identify and prioritize based on the worst fitting bin, but (19th) incorrectly tries to pinpoint a single index, which is unnecessary.  Overall, the best heuristics consistently apply exponential weighting to waste, normalizing to create a probability distribution for bin selection.  The lower-ranked heuristics lack this sophistication, often returning zero priorities or incorrectly prioritizing bins.

**Experience:**

Effective bin packing heuristics benefit from weighting available space, normalizing priorities for a probabilistic selection, and avoiding unnecessary complexity in identifying specific "worst" fits. Exponential weighting of waste proved to be crucial for strong performance. Using `np.where` is beneficial, but needs to be precise for correct functionality.
