**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both use inverse waste with exponential weighting, but the 1st normalizes *after* exponentiation on all possible bins, while the 2nd normalizes only on feasible bins and uses a scaling factor of 5.  (1st) is preferable due to broader consideration.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), (3rd) simply returns zeros â€“ a baseline, while (4th) computes a relative waste and uses an exponential weighting, offering a proper prioritization. (4th) is significantly better.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), both calculate inverse waste, but (6th) adds `min_waste` to the denominator which can smooth the priority landscape but potentially over-corrects. (5th) is cleaner.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), both are fundamentally inverse waste, (7th) directly uses the distance (waste) in the exponential, while (8th) calculates distances explicitly and then applies the inverse. (7th) is concise and likely performs similarly.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), both use exponential weighting based on waste, but (10th) calculates *relative* waste (item/capacity), offering a better normalization. (10th) is superior.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th/13th), (11th) returns only zeros. (12th/13th) are identical and introduce a threshold and weight, resulting in a meaningful prioritization. (12th/13th) are far better.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th/16th), (14th), (15th) and (16th) are identical. All are good as they use an exponential function of waste, but the constant `5` may require tuning.

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), (17th) tries to find the *worst* fit and prioritize that bin, which is a very unusual approach and likely suboptimal. (18th) computes an exponential of `item / capacity`, which is a more standard practice. (18th) is better.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), (19th) is using a small value to avoid dividing by zero and normalizing by the sum of priorities, but (20th) uses the worst fit capacities which can lead to poor packing. (19th) is better.

Overall: Prioritizing based on inverse waste combined with exponential weighting appears to be the strongest pattern. Normalizing appropriately (after exponentiation, or using relative waste) is crucial. Adding thresholds or fixed weights requires careful tuning.  Directly focusing on the 'worst' fit appears to be a flawed strategy.  Simplicity and clear mathematical basis (like inverse waste) generally outperform complex, ad-hoc approaches.

**Experience:**

Effective bin packing heuristics heavily rely on quantifying "goodness of fit."  Combining inverse waste with exponential weighting offers a robust way to favor tighter fits, while proper normalization prevents numerical instability and ensures fair comparison across bins. Avoid overly complex logic focused on identifying "worst" cases.
