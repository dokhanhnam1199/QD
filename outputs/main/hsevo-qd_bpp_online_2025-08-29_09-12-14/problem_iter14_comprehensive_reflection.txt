Okay, let's refine the approach to designing superior bin-packing heuristics, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown based on the provided self-reflection:

* **Keywords:** Waste Minimization, Normalization, Exponential Weighting, Relative Prioritization.
* **Advice:** Focus on a *waste-to-item-size ratio* for prioritization, normalize this into probabilities, and leverage exponential weighting to refine bin selection. Always explicitly handle cases where an item doesn't fit *any* bin.
* **Avoid:** Direct remaining capacity use *without* item size context, negative priorities, redundant code, and overly complex "worst-fit" logic. Beware of numerical instability (division by zero, `exp` overflow).
* **Explanation:**  Strong heuristics aren't about absolute capacity; they're about efficiently using space *relative to what’s being packed*. Exponential weighting encourages exploring tighter fits while still allowing larger bins to be considered – balancing exploitation and exploration.
