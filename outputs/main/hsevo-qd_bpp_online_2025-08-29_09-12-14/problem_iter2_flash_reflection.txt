**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` in the 1st heuristic vs. the 20th, we see the 1st prioritizes bins based on the inverse of remaining capacity minus the item size, effectively favoring tighter fits. The 20th does the same, but also assigns -1 to invalid bins, which doesn't contribute to prioritization *between* valid bins.  Comparing the 2nd vs. the 19th, both calculate waste, but the 2nd only prioritizes valid bins, while the 19th assigns -1 to invalid bins—similar to the 20th—and offers no relative prioritization amongst the valid bins. 

Comparing 1st vs. 2nd, both use `1/(waste + 1e-6)` but the 2nd calculates `waste` more efficiently. Comparing 3rd vs. 4th, they are almost identical. Comparing 6th vs 7th, identical.  Comparing 8th/9th vs. the others, 8th/9th introduce an exponential weighting, promoting bins with larger remaining capacity slightly more aggressively than the simple inverse waste approach. The use of the exponential function is a key difference.  Heuristics 11th, 12th, and 13th import unnecessary libraries and are essentially empty or incomplete implementations. The 16th uses `np.exp` in a different way, but doesn't seem particularly effective. The 17th attempts to prioritize by remaining capacity/item size, potentially leading to instability. 18th is flawed – it identifies *a* worst bin but doesn't use this information effectively. The addition of -1 to invalid bins in 19th and 20th doesn’t contribute to good bin selection.

Overall, the best heuristics (1st-9th) focus on prioritizing bins with minimal waste, either directly (inverse waste) or with a more nuanced weighting (exponential). The poorer heuristics either lack meaningful prioritization logic, introduce unnecessary complexity (imports), or have flawed implementations. A critical element is handling invalid bins - simply marking them doesn't help in selecting the *best* valid bin.

**Experience:**

Effective bin-packing heuristics prioritize minimizing waste. Inverse waste calculations, potentially with exponential weighting, consistently outperform approaches that don't explicitly address bin fit. Avoid unnecessary imports and negative priority assignments; focus on relative prioritization *between* valid bins to drive better packing decisions.
