**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, but the 2nd version uses an exponential weighting of the waste, normalized across valid bins. This makes it more sensitive to variations in waste and can lead to better bin utilization. (3rd) vs (4th): Essentially identical implementations, simply repeating the same inverse waste heuristic. (5th) vs (6th): Again, duplicates, with (5th) using relative waste before exponential weighting, while (6th) does not. (7th), (8th) and (9th) all implement the basic inverse waste. (8th) and (9th) attempt minor optimizations like finding the minimum waste, but they donâ€™t significantly alter the core strategy. (10th) and (11th) are incomplete, not providing a usable priority calculation. (12th) and (13th) and (15th) are similar inverse waste calculations. (14th) combines inverse waste with an exponential weighting, similar to (2nd), improving fit. (16th), (17th) and (18th) calculate the waste directly as a ratio. (19th) and (20th) use an exponential decay of a fit ratio. Comparing (2nd) vs (14th), (2nd) normalizes priorities making it robust across various bin capacities. Comparing (19th) and (20th), are duplicates.

Overall: The most effective heuristics utilize a combination of inverse waste and exponential weighting, with normalization to ensure consistent behavior. Simpler inverse waste approaches perform adequately, but lack the nuance to handle varied waste scenarios. Duplicated code and incomplete implementations contribute to the lower ranking.

**Experience:**

Prioritize heuristics that consider both remaining capacity *and* the magnitude of the waste created. Normalization ensures the heuristic functions consistently, regardless of bin sizes. Avoid redundant code and ensure complete implementations. Exponential weighting of waste seems to improve the quality of the solution.
