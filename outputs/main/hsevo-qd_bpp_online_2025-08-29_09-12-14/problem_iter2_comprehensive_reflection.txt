Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design principles â€“ aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Waste minimization, Relative prioritization, Bin fit, Exponential weighting.
* **Advice:** Explicitly model & optimize for *remaining* bin space. Prioritize bins based on how well the *next* item fits, not absolute capacity. Explore exponentially weighting tighter fits.
* **Avoid:** Absolute thresholds, negative prioritization, focusing on *filling* bins rather than minimizing wasted space.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics succeed by quickly finding *good enough* solutions. Focusing on relative improvements (best fit *next*) and directly tackling waste yields faster convergence to higher-quality packings than complex, absolute rules.
