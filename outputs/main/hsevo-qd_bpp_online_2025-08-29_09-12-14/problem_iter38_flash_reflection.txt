**Analysis:**

Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, we see the 1st uses `np.exp(-relative_waste)` with normalization, incorporating a measure of how much 'space' is left *relative* to the item size, and normalizing to create a probability distribution. The 2nd is extremely basic, returning all zeros, making it useless.

Comparing the 1st and 3rd, both employ exponential weighting of waste, but the 1st normalizes by `np.sum(priorities) + 1e-8`, providing robustness against zero sums, while the 3rd normalizes only over feasible bins.

Comparing the 4th/6th/7th (identical) to the 1st, the 4th/6th/7th uses a simple inverse waste, potentially leading to instability with small waste values. They also import unnecessary libraries. The 1stâ€™s relative waste measure and exponential weighting offer better differentiation and scaling.

The 5th, 8th and 9th are very similar to the 3rd, but differ in normalization. The 5th normalizes across all bins while the 8th and 9th normalize only feasible bins, potentially causing issues if few bins are feasible.

The 10th combines relative waste and exponential weighting, but the `1e-6` addition in the denominator of the exponential could be unnecessary.

The 11th and 14th again have a near-zero utility base function. The 12th, 15th, and 16th use exponential weighting of waste. The 12th's normalization is well-defined.

The 13th, 15th, and 17th share a similar structure but differ slightly in constant values, showing that minor constant variations can impact performance.

Heuristics 18th, 19th and 20th use fit ratio. They don't use relative waste; the simple `fit` calculation is less informative than considering remaining space.

Overall, the best heuristics consistently incorporate relative waste, exponential weighting, and robust normalization to handle edge cases, demonstrating the importance of these three elements for effective bin prioritization. Avoiding unnecessary imports is also crucial.

**Experience:**

Prioritize relative waste over absolute waste to improve adaptability. Use exponential weighting to accentuate differences in bin suitability. Implement robust normalization to prevent issues with zero sums or limited feasible bins. Keep the code concise and avoid unnecessary imports to maintain performance and readability.
