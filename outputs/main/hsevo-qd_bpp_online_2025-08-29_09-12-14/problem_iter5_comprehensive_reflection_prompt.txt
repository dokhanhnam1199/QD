{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics prioritize tighter fits (lower waste) and should normalize outputs into a probability distribution. Avoid direct use of remaining capacity without considering item size. Exponential weighting adds crucial nuance. Always handle potential division-by-zero errors.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective bin-packing heuristics prioritize minimizing waste. Inverse waste calculations, potentially with exponential weighting, consistently outperform approaches that don't explicitly address bin fit. Avoid unnecessary imports and negative priority assignments; focus on relative prioritization *between* valid bins to drive better packing decisions.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
