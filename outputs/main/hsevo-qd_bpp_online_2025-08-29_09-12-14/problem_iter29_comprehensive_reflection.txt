Okay, let's distill this extensive self-reflection into actionable heuristic design guidance. Here's a breakdown to maximize your $999K investment!

* **Keywords:** Waste minimization, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *relative* waste (item size considered). Combine inverse waste with exponential weighting *before* normalization to a probability distribution. Focus on quantifying "goodness of fit" rather than identifying "worst" fits.
* **Avoid:** Direct remaining capacity use, unnecessary complexity, searching for absolute worst cases, operating on infeasible solutions, and neglecting edge case handling (zero sizes, no fit).
* **Explanation:** The core theme is balancing exploitation (tightest fits via inverse waste/weighting) with exploration (normalization for robustness). Numerical stability and efficiency (avoiding redundant calculations) are critical for scalable performance.
