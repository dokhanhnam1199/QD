Okay, here's a refined self-reflection focused on designing superior bin-packing heuristics, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Exponential weighting, Normalization, Inverse Waste, Feasibility, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize a score based on `exp(-waste/item_size)` for each feasible bin. Normalize these scores (using softmax or similar) into a probability distribution. Tune the exponent for exploration/exploitation. Explicitly handle cases where *no* bins fit.
* **Avoid:**  Directly using remaining capacity, negative priorities, complex "worst-fit" logic, and redundant calculations. Donâ€™t normalize *before* filtering for feasibility.
* **Explanation:** Exponential weighting amplifies the benefit of tight fits *relative* to item size. Normalization ensures probabilistic, stable selection. Focusing on feasible bins avoids wasted computation and maintains robustness, crucial for scaling.
