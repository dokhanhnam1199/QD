**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v2` (2nd), both calculate inverse waste, but the 1st uses a small constant to avoid division by zero while the second is identical. The first implementation is negligibly better due to numerical stability.  `priority_v2` (3rd) improves upon this by adding exponential weighting to the inverse waste, prioritizing tighter fits.  `priority_v2` (4th) is similar to (3rd) but normalizes the waste by the item size. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the normalization in (4th) is a slight improvement, as it makes the waste relative to the item being placed.  `priority_v2` (5th) attempts to use waste but reverts to a simple calculation, offering no advantage. `priority_v2` (6th) reverts to using `np.exp(-waste)` which, while giving a priority, lacks normalization and isn't as effective as inverse waste approaches. Heuristics 7th, 9th, and 12th all return a zero array.  `priority_v2` (8th), (10th), (11th) and (16th) use `waste / (item + waste)`.  This is a good approach but lacks the exponential weighting of the higher-ranked heuristics.  `priority_v2` (13th) calculates inverse waste with exponential weighting and then *normalizes* the priorities. This is an excellent addition, providing a probability distribution. `priority_v2` (14th) uses a sigmoid function, which is a reasonable fit-based priority. `priority_v2` (15th) calculates `(remaining_capacities - item) / item`, favoring bins with large remaining capacity. `priority_v2` (17th) is a nearly identical implementation to (20th) and calculates exponential of normalized waste. `priority_v2` (18th) directly uses remaining capacity.  `priority_v2` (19th) uses an exponential decay based on the fit ratio; a larger fit ratio results in a lower priority. `priority_v1` in all cases is simply a zero array, making it the worst option. Overall, the best heuristics combine inverse waste with exponential weighting and normalization, providing a well-defined priority distribution.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics prioritize tighter fits (lower waste) and should normalize outputs into a probability distribution. Avoid direct use of remaining capacity without considering item size. Exponential weighting adds crucial nuance. Always handle potential division-by-zero errors.
