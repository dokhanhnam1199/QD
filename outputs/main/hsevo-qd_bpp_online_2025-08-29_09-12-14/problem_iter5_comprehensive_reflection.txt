Okay, $999K motivates *serious* heuristic design! Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" based on your provided insights, geared towards building superior bin-packing (and generally applicable) heuristics:

* **Keywords:** Fit, Probability, Weighting, Robustness
* **Advice:** Prioritize bin *fit* quantified as a probability (normalized volume used). Employ exponential weighting of fit to favor significantly better options.  Always validate bin capacity *after* potential placement.
* **Avoid:**  Directly using remaining capacity; negative prioritization; ignoring item size relative to bin; failing to handle division by zero.
* **Explanation:** Focusing on probabilistic fit, and robustly weighting it, guides the heuristic to consistently select bins yielding the *least waste* – the core goal – while maintaining numerical stability.
