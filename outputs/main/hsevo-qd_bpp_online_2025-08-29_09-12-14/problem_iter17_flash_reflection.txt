**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st uses `np.exp(-waste_ratio * 2)` and normalizes, providing a smoother, scaled priority, while the 2nd directly uses the inverse of remaining capacity, leading to potentially large variations and lack of smoothing. (1st) is more robust.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both aim for inverse waste with exponential weighting. However, (4th) explicitly handles the case where no bins are valid, and the use of `1e-6` in the denominator prevents division-by-zero more cleanly than the implicit handling in (3rd) â€“ a basic function that only returns 0s.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), (6th) is slightly better as it computes the *distance* (remaining capacity - item) directly. (5th) recalculates this unnecessarily. Both are simpler than (1st) and (4th).

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), they are very similar. (8th) is more concise, calculating the exponential fit directly.  Both normalize.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), (10th) is just a stub returning all zeros, making (9th) clearly superior, though still relatively simple.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), (11th) has a more sophisticated scaling using `1 + np.exp(-5 * (waste / (min_waste + 1e-6)))` which allows for more nuanced priority assignment based on the minimum waste, giving it an edge.

Comparing (13th) vs (14th), (14th) attempts to prioritize based on the waste itself, while (13th) is closer to the better examples (inverse waste). (14th) will likely perform poorly.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), both are attempting to find the worst fit, but (16th) has an extremely convoluted way of doing so. (15th) is simpler and more direct.

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), (18th) is more robust due to normalization. (17th) doesn't normalize and uses a hardcoded factor of 5.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), both are identical. They use the fit ratio and exponential weighting but are not normalized.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 4th, 8th, 11th) consistently utilize exponential weighting of waste/remaining capacity, *normalization*, and handle edge cases (no valid bins) well.  Simpler heuristics (3rd, 5th, 6th) perform adequately but lack the robustness of the best.  The worst perform poorly due to lack of normalization, overly complex logic, or returning zeros.



**Experience:**

Prioritize normalization in bin selection heuristics to ensure probabilities sum to 1. Exponential weighting of waste/remaining capacity helps distinguish between bins. Robust handling of edge cases (e.g., no suitable bins) is crucial.  Avoid unnecessary complexity and recomputations.
