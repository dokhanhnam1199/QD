Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    return priorities\n\n    bin_count = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priorities = np.zeros(bin_count)\n    for i in range(bin_count):\n        if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:\n            priorities[i] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + 0.0001)\n        else:\n            priorities[i] = 0.0\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, here\u2019s a refined self-reflection distilled into actionable advice for designing better heuristics, aiming for that $999K!\n\n* **Keywords:** Relative Waste, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize *relative* waste (waste *vs.* item size) and use exponential weighting to balance exploitation of good bins with exploration of potentially better fits. Always normalize scores to a probability distribution.\n* **Avoid:** Absolute remaining capacity, negative priorities, unnecessary complexity, redundant calculations, and ignoring edge cases (item doesn't fit *any* bin).\n* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren't about finding the *absolute* best, but consistently selecting *better* bins. Normalization ensures stable, comparable scores. Robustness guarantees performance across diverse inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
