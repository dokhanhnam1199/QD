**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 20th, the 1st employs a more robust handling of edge cases (empty valid bins) and a finer weighting of waste via `1e-6` addition, preventing division by zero. The 20th's simple `fit_ratio` exponentiation lacks this robustness. 

Comparing 1st vs 2nd, the 2nd normalizes based on the capacity instead of the waste which is a disadvantage. 

Comparing 3rd vs 4th, the 3rd is more concise and skips unnecessary variable assignments found in the 4th. Both attempt similar weighting, but the 3rd's brevity is favored.

Comparing 6th vs 7th, the 7th introduces `relative_waste` which offers potentially better scaling, while the 6th uses a direct `exp_fits`, making it less adaptive to varying bin sizes.

Comparing 11th/12th vs 13th, the 11th/12th introduce tunable parameters `threshold` and `weight`, but are identical. The 13th uses a sigmoid-like function which offers smooth prioritization, but lacks flexibility without parameters.

The repeated code in 14th-17th is a major drawback. The 18th directly uses remaining capacity as priority, which is naive. Heuristics 5th, 9th, and 19th introduce unnecessary imports or are very basic.

Overall, the best heuristics (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th) consistently use exponential weighting of waste, normalization, and handle edge cases effectively. The worst (18th, 14th-17th, 5th, 9th) have repeated code, lack robustness, or are overly simplistic.

**Experience:**

Prioritize exponential weighting of remaining capacity/waste for strong bin prioritization. Normalization is vital. Include a small constant (e.g., `1e-6`) to prevent division-by-zero errors. Avoid redundant code and provide tunable parameters for adaptability and fine-tuning performance.
