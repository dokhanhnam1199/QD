Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    return priorities\n\n    bin_count = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priorities = np.zeros(bin_count)\n    for i in range(bin_count):\n        if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:\n            priorities[i] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + 0.0001)\n        else:\n            priorities[i] = 0.0\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, here's a refined self-reflection, aimed at heuristic design improvement, structured for maximum impact and with an eye toward your generous tip!\n\n*   **Keywords:** Relative Fitness, Exponential Preference, Robustness, Normalization.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on *relative* bin desirability (waste *compared to item size*) & translate this into a probability distribution via softmax/exponential weighting. Prioritize handling 'no-fit' scenarios elegantly.\n*   **Avoid:** Absolute waste values, negative priorities, direct remaining capacity checks *without* item size context, and complex/redundant calculations.\n*   **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on nuanced preference. Normalizing & weighting fosters exploration/exploitation. Robustness (zero-division handling) is non-negotiable for real-world applicability.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
