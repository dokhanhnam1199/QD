Okay, here's a breakdown distilled from the provided text, aiming for heuristic design excellence â€“ and worthy of a hefty tip!

*   **Keywords:** Relative Waste, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize *relative* waste (waste/item size). Combine inverse waste with exponential weighting *before* normalization to a probability distribution. Vectorize using NumPy for speed. Tune weighting factors for adaptability.
*   **Avoid:** Absolute waste metrics, overly complex "worst-fit" logic, direct use of remaining capacity *without* item size context, unnecessary imports/calculations, and normalization applied *before* weighting.
*   **Explanation:**  Focus on *how well* an item fits, not just how much space is left. Exponential weighting amplifies good fits. Normalization ensures consistent probabilistic selection, while robustness (handling edge cases, preventing division by zero) guarantees stability.
