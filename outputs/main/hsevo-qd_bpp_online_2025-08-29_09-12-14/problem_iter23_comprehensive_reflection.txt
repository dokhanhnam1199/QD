Okay, let's distill those reflections into actionable heuristic design guidance. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K reward!

* **Keywords:** Waste minimization, exponential weighting, normalization, relative prioritization, robustness.
* **Advice:** Focus on quantifying *relative* fit (waste/item size). Use inverse waste with exponential weighting *before* normalization to a probability distribution. Prioritize simplicity and clear logic.
* **Avoid:** Identifying "worst" fits, direct use of remaining capacity alone, unnecessary complexity, negative prioritization, redundant calculations.
* **Explanation:**  Strong heuristics arenâ€™t about finding bad options, but consistently favoring *better* ones. Normalization creates a stable, comparable scoring system, while exponential weighting refines sensitivity to fit quality. Robustness handles all scenarios gracefully.
