{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize normalization in bin selection heuristics to ensure probabilities sum to 1. Exponential weighting of waste/remaining capacity helps distinguish between bins. Robust handling of edge cases (e.g., no suitable bins) is crucial.  Avoid unnecessary complexity and recomputations.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective bin-packing heuristics prioritize minimizing waste. Inverse waste calculations, potentially with exponential weighting, consistently outperform approaches that don't explicitly address bin fit. Avoid unnecessary imports and negative priority assignments; focus on relative prioritization *between* valid bins to drive better packing decisions.\n\nEffective heuristics prioritize tighter fits (lower waste) and should normalize outputs into a probability distribution. Avoid direct use of remaining capacity without considering item size. Exponential weighting adds crucial nuance. Always handle potential division-by-zero errors.\n\nEffective bin packing heuristics should prioritize bins with minimal waste *relative to the item size*.  Exponential weighting balances exploration and exploitation. Explicitly handling the case where no bins fit the item is crucial. Numerical stability (avoiding division by zero, ensuring `exp` inputs aren\u2019t too large) is vital for reliable performance.  Prioritizing readability and avoiding redundant calculations improves maintainability.\n\nEffective bin packing heuristics benefit from weighting available space, normalizing priorities for a probabilistic selection, and avoiding unnecessary complexity in identifying specific \"worst\" fits. Exponential weighting of waste proved to be crucial for strong performance. Using `np.where` is beneficial, but needs to be precise for correct functionality.\n\nPrioritize heuristics that consider both remaining capacity *and* the magnitude of the waste created. Normalization ensures the heuristic functions consistently, regardless of bin sizes. Avoid redundant code and ensure complete implementations. Exponential weighting of waste seems to improve the quality of the solution.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
