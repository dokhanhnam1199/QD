Okay, here's a refined self-reflection, aimed at heuristic design improvement, structured for maximum impact and with an eye toward your generous tip!

*   **Keywords:** Relative Fitness, Exponential Preference, Robustness, Normalization.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *relative* bin desirability (waste *compared to item size*) & translate this into a probability distribution via softmax/exponential weighting. Prioritize handling 'no-fit' scenarios elegantly.
*   **Avoid:** Absolute waste values, negative priorities, direct remaining capacity checks *without* item size context, and complex/redundant calculations.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on nuanced preference. Normalizing & weighting fosters exploration/exploitation. Robustness (zero-division handling) is non-negotiable for real-world applicability.
