Okay, let's distill this into actionable heuristic design guidance, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown based on your insightful self-reflection:

* **Keywords:** Waste Minimization, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *relative* waste – weight waste *by item size* and normalize to probabilities. Use exponential weighting on waste to amplify differences between bin fits. Always handle “no fit” scenarios gracefully.
* **Avoid:** Direct use of remaining capacity *alone*, negative priorities, unnecessary complexity, redundant calculations, and potential numerical instability (division by zero, large exponents).
* **Explanation:** Effective bin packing isn’t about absolute capacity; it’s about how *well* an item fits *within* that capacity. Normalization & weighting create a stable, nuanced selection process, enhancing both solution quality and robustness.
