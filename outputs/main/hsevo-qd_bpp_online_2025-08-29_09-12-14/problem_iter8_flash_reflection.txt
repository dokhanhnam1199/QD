**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the 1st provides a more nuanced priority calculation (1/(remaining-item)) compared to the 2nd, which simply returns zeros. This demonstrates the importance of considering remaining space.  Comparing 1st vs 3rd, they are identical, showcasing redundancy. Comparing 4th vs 5th, both implement inverse waste and exponential weighting, but 4th explicitly calculates `possible_bins` improving readability and efficiency.  Comparing 6th vs 8th, these are identical. Comparing 7th vs 9th, 7th uses a simpler distance calculation, while 9th normalizes by the *minimum* waste which is less robust.  Comparing 11th vs 13th, they're functionally the same. Comparing 16th vs 20th, 16th uses `exp(1/(waste+1e-6))`, which could lead to instability, while 20th uses `exp(waste/(item+1e-6))` which is more numerically stable and conceptually linked to bin "fullness." Heuristics 10th, 12th, 14th, and 15th are minimal and ineffective, simply returning zero priorities. Heuristics 17th and 18th offer some calculation but are less sophisticated than the top-ranked options. Overall, the best heuristics prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, incorporating inverse waste and exponential weighting, and emphasize numerical stability and clarity. The worst heuristics simply return zero priorities or minimal calculations.

**Experience:**

Effective bin packing heuristics should prioritize bins with minimal waste *relative to the item size*.  Exponential weighting balances exploration and exploitation. Explicitly handling the case where no bins fit the item is crucial. Numerical stability (avoiding division by zero, ensuring `exp` inputs arenâ€™t too large) is vital for reliable performance.  Prioritizing readability and avoiding redundant calculations improves maintainability.
