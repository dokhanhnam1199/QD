Okay, hereâ€™s a refined self-reflection distilled into actionable advice for designing better heuristics, aiming for that $999K!

* **Keywords:** Relative Waste, Exponential Weighting, Normalization, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *relative* waste (waste *vs.* item size) and use exponential weighting to balance exploitation of good bins with exploration of potentially better fits. Always normalize scores to a probability distribution.
* **Avoid:** Absolute remaining capacity, negative priorities, unnecessary complexity, redundant calculations, and ignoring edge cases (item doesn't fit *any* bin).
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren't about finding the *absolute* best, but consistently selecting *better* bins. Normalization ensures stable, comparable scores. Robustness guarantees performance across diverse inputs.
