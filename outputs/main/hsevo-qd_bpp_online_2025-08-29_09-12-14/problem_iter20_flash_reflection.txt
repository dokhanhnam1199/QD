**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both combine inverse waste with exponential weighting, but the 1st uses `min_waste` to normalize the exponent, making it more robust to varying waste sizes. (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd normalizes *after* the exponential weighting which improves stability, while the 4th normalizes before, leading to more sensitivity.  (5th) vs (6th): Both are similar waste ratio based weighting, but 5th includes an arbitrary epsilon. (7th) vs (8th): 7th provides a basic inverse waste, 8th attempts to improve with min_waste, resulting in slightly better performance. (9th) vs (10th): 10th streamlines the inverse waste and exponential weighting, making it more concise and likely better performing. (11th) vs (12th): 11th incorporates `min_waste`, 12th uses a different epsilon â€“ neither provide substantial improvements. (13th) vs (14th): 13th is a waste ratio, 14th introduces a 'temperature', though it's never used. (15th) vs (16th): 15th attempts a temperature-scaled exponential but isn't fully utilized, while 16th is a more direct inverse waste approach. (17th) and (18th) similarly introduce parameters without clear benefit. (19th) vs (20th): 19th uses a simple waste ratio, 20th tries to find the "worst fit" but inefficiently iterates. Overall, the best heuristics focus on inverse waste with an exponential weighting and normalization, crucially normalizing *after* the weighting for stability and using a relative minimum waste calculation. Simplicity and avoiding unused parameters (temperature, epsilon) are essential.

**Experience:**

Effective bin-packing heuristics prioritize minimizing waste while balancing exploration. Inverse waste, especially when combined with exponential weighting and *post*-normalization, consistently performs well.  Avoid unnecessary parameters or computations.  Robustness is key: account for edge cases and scale well with varying bin capacities and item sizes.
