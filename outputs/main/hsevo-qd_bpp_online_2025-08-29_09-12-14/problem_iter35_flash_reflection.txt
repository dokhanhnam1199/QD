**Analysis:**
Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v1` (2nd), we observe the first employs a sophisticated combination of inverse waste, exponential weighting, and viable bin focusing, while the second is an empty function, providing no prioritization. The 1st prioritizes bins with lower relative waste, scaling by 5 and normalizing. `priority_v2` (3rd) is also a strong contender, utilizing exponential weighting of waste but normalizing using the minimum waste, which can be sensitive to outliers. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the 1st is more robust as it scales relative waste directly, avoiding reliance on the minimum. `priority_v2` (4th) performs a similar calculation as the 1st, but less efficiently due to explicit loops and indexing. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd leverages NumPy vectorization more effectively.  `priority_v2` (6th) and (8th) are identical implementations, applying inverse waste with exponential weighting, yet they are ranked lower because of a less optimized normalization procedure and potentially numerical instability due to the `waste + 1e-6`. `priority_v2` (9th) scales the waste by item and applies exponential weighting. Heuristics 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th exhibit similar problems to the 2nd, utilizing `priority_v1` or providing minimal implementation. Heuristics 13th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th introduce various prioritization schemes, but either lack effective normalization or exhibit inferior performance compared to the top-ranked heuristics due to less robust weighting or normalization. Overall: The best heuristics consistently combine inverse waste, exponential weighting, and appropriate normalization techniques, leveraging NumPy's vectorization for efficiency. Avoiding direct use of min/max for normalization and scaling by the item size or relative waste appears to improve robustness.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for bin packing emphasize prioritizing bins that minimize waste *relative* to the item size. Exponential weighting refines this by favoring bins with significantly lower waste. Robustness is critical; avoid normalization strategies vulnerable to extreme values. NumPy vectorization is crucial for performance.
