Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a Best Fit (BF) strategy.\n\n    Bins where the item fits perfectly get the highest priority. Among bins where the item fits,\n    those leaving less remaining capacity are preferred. Bins where the item does not fit\n    are assigned the lowest possible priority.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item in each bin\n    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Initialize priority scores\n    # We use -np.inf for bins where the item cannot fit, ensuring they are never chosen.\n    # For bins where it fits, we prioritize by minimizing the remaining space.\n    # A smaller remaining_after_placement value means a better fit (closer to zero).\n    # To maximize this as a priority score, we take the negative of remaining_after_placement.\n    # So, a perfect fit (remaining_after_placement = 0) gets a priority of 0,\n    # a near-perfect fit (e.g., remaining_after_placement = 0.1) gets -0.1,\n    # and a loose fit (e.g., remaining_after_placement = 10) gets -10.\n    # The higher the value (closer to 0 for negatives, or 0 itself), the better.\n    priorities = -remaining_after_placement\n\n    # Set priority to negative infinity for bins where the item does not fit\n    # (i.e., remaining_after_placement is negative)\n    priorities[remaining_after_placement < 0] = -np.inf\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nHere's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Directness, Robustness, Interpretability, Proportionality.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with simple, direct functions linearly proportional to key problem objectives. Prioritize interpretability and robustness; add complexity incrementally only if clear performance gains are proven.\n*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary non-linear weighting or excessive parameterization without strong theoretical justification. Such approaches often introduce fragility, obscure decision logic, and hinder generalizability.\n*   **Explanation:** Best Fit's robustness underscores that transparent, proportional relationships to problem state (e.g., remaining capacity) yield superior performance across diverse instances. Non-linearities can often distort this, leading to brittle or sub-optimal decision-making.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
