def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function embodies the principle of "optimal packing" by favoring bins
    that, after accommodating the incoming item, will be left with the smallest
    possible remaining capacity. Think of it as striving for atomic stability:
    we seek to minimize the "energy" (wasted space) within each bin.

    Bins that cannot accommodate the item are effectively 'forbidden' as they
    would lead to an unstable configuration (overflow) and are assigned the
    lowest possible priority, akin to highly unstable radioactive isotopes.
    Among the bins where the item fits, the higher priority is given to the one
    that achieves the tightest fit, thus optimizing the bin's fill level and
    conserving overall space, much like a dense, well-organized crystalline structure.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin. This is the 'particle' we wish to place.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of current remaining capacities for each bin.
                         These are our 'containers'.

    Return:
        Array of the same size as bins_remain_cap, where each value is the
        priority score for placing the item into the corresponding bin.
        The bin with the highest score will be selected.

    potential_remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize all priorities to a very low value (-infinity).
    # This ensures that bins where the item cannot fit are never chosen.
    # It represents an impossible or highly undesirable 'reaction path'.

    # For the bins where the item fits, we want to assign a higher priority
    # to those that result in the smallest positive remaining space.
    # A smaller 'potential_remaining_space' means a 'tighter' fit.
    # To achieve this with a maximum priority score, we take the negative
    # of the potential remaining space. This way, a smaller positive value
    # (e.g., 0.1 remaining) yields a larger (less negative) priority (-0.1)
    # compared to a larger positive value (e.g., 0.5 remaining) yielding (-0.5).
    # This pushes the system towards the most 'stable' and 'packed' configuration.
