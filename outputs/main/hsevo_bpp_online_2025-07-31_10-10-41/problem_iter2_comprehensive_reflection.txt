Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Directness, Robustness, Interpretability, Proportionality.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with simple, direct functions linearly proportional to key problem objectives. Prioritize interpretability and robustness; add complexity incrementally only if clear performance gains are proven.
*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary non-linear weighting or excessive parameterization without strong theoretical justification. Such approaches often introduce fragility, obscure decision logic, and hinder generalizability.
*   **Explanation:** Best Fit's robustness underscores that transparent, proportional relationships to problem state (e.g., remaining capacity) yield superior performance across diverse instances. Non-linearities can often distort this, leading to brittle or sub-optimal decision-making.
