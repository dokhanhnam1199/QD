*   **Keywords:** Heuristic Baseline, Additive Incentives, Perfect Fits, Logic Validation, Parameter Tuning.
*   **Advice:** Use Best Fit as an analytical starting concept. Implement additive bonuses for desirable outcomes like bin completion. Strongly prioritize perfect item-bin fits. Verify all core placement logic for completeness. Rigorously tune heuristic parameters.
*   **Avoid:** Stating Best Fit's general performance, prescribing specific linear/non-linear penalties, or vague calls for calculation simplicity or robustness for invalid inputs.
*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes building from a conceptual baseline with positive, targeted mechanisms, ensuring foundational correctness, and optimizing through calibration, rather than focusing on specific penalty forms or broad performance comparisons.
