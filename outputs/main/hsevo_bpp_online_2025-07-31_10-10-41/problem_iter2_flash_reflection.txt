**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th: These heuristics are functionally identical, all implementing the classic "Best Fit" strategy. They assign a priority as the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item (`-(bins_remain_cap - item)`). A perfect fit results in a priority of 0, while larger remaining capacities yield increasingly negative priorities. The differences among them are purely cosmetic (docstrings, comments, variable names) or minor syntactic variations (e.g., using `np.where` vs. direct boolean masking), which do not alter the core logic. Their consistent high ranking indicates the strong efficacy and robustness of this specific linear priority function.

Comparing 1st (Best Fit) vs 4th (Feynman): The 1st heuristic uses a linear negative relationship to remaining space, while the 4th heuristic uses an inverse relationship: `1.0 / (remaining_space + 1e-9)`. This inverse function creates a significantly non-linear priority scaling. A perfect fit receives an extremely high priority, and priorities drop off very steeply even for slightly larger remaining capacities. The fact that the 4th heuristic is ranked lower suggests that this aggressive, non-linear amplification of "best fits" might be detrimental. It could lead to a greedy approach that is too focused on immediate, near-perfect fits, potentially preventing better overall packing by leaving less optimal but still viable options for subsequent items.

Comparing 1st (Best Fit) vs 11th-20th (Quantum): While the 1st heuristic maintains a linear negative priority, the 11th-20th heuristics employ an exponential decay function: `np.exp(-(remaining_capacity - item))`. This also introduces a non-linear weighting, where a perfect fit yields a priority of 1.0, and values decay exponentially towards zero for looser fits. The consistently lower ranking of this exponential approach compared to the linear Best Fit suggests that this smoother, non-linear decay also performs worse. It might not differentiate sufficiently among various levels of "goodness" for non-perfect fits, or its curve might not align optimally with the problem's combinatorial nature, leading to suboptimal overall solutions.

Overall: The results strongly demonstrate that the classic Best Fit heuristic, which uses a simple linear inverse relationship between priority and remaining capacity, is empirically superior for this bin packing scenario. Non-linear transformations of the priority function (like inverse or exponential scaling) appear to degrade performance, likely by distorting the relative desirability of bins in a way that doesn't lead to optimal global packing.

**Experience:**
For bin packing, the robust and simple Best Fit heuristic (linear penalty for wasted space) often outperforms non-linear priority functions. Overly aggressive or subtle non-linear weighting can hinder overall packing efficiency; a balanced, direct relationship to remaining capacity proves more effective.
