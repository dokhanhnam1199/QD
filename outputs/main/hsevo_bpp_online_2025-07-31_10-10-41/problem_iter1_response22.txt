    This heuristic is inspired by the principle of efficient packing and
    minimizing waste, akin to how physical systems seek the most stable and
    compact arrangements. It prioritizes bins that will result in the least
    remaining capacity after accommodating the item, thus yielding the "tightest" fit.
    This method aims to consolidate items effectively, much like how celestial bodies
    draw together to form dense structures, thereby minimizing the total space required.
    Bins that cannot fit the item are, naturally, given a vanishingly low priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the remaining capacity if the item were placed in each bin.
    # This quantity is akin to the 'potential energy' of a bin after receiving the item;
    # we seek to minimize this potential for wasted space, leading to a more stable configuration.
    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priorities. Bins that cannot accommodate the item must be excluded
    # from consideration, as they violate the fundamental laws of fit.
    # Assigning them a negative infinity value ensures they are never chosen
    # when valid options exist.
    priority_scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

    # Identify bins where the item can fit (remaining capacity is non-negative).
    # This signifies a physically possible placement.
    can_fit_mask = remaining_after_placement >= 0

    # For those bins that can accommodate the item, we desire to select the one that
    # leaves the smallest possible non-negative remaining capacity. This is the
    # essence of the "Best Fit" strategy, designed for optimal consolidation of matter.
    #
    # To translate this into a priority score where 'higher' means 'better':
    #   - A remaining capacity of 0 (a perfect, harmonious fit) is ideal, yielding the highest priority.
    #   - Small positive remaining capacities are next preferred, as they are nearly ideal.
    #   - Larger positive remaining capacities are less preferred, indicating greater disarray.
    #
    # Thus, the priority score is the negative of the remaining capacity.
    # A smaller positive remainder (e.g., 0.1) results in a larger priority (-0.1)
    # compared to a larger remainder (e.g., 10), which results in a smaller priority (-10).
    # A perfect fit (0 remainder) results in the highest possible priority (0).
