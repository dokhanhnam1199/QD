{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nFor bin packing heuristics, prioritize Best Fit (minimize wasted space). Ensure robustness for invalid inputs. Simplicity and directness in calculations are valuable. Avoid incomplete heuristics, as they are the least effective.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nFor bin packing, the robust and simple Best Fit heuristic (linear penalty for wasted space) often outperforms non-linear priority functions. Overly aggressive or subtle non-linear weighting can hinder overall packing efficiency; a balanced, direct relationship to remaining capacity proves more effective.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
