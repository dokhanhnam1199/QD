Here's the redefined 'Current self-reflection' for designing better bin packing heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Strategies, Global State Inference, Feature Engineering, Multi-criteria Optimization.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that dynamically adapt their logic based on current problem characteristics. Explore synergistic combinations of diverse packing rules. Prioritize leveraging comprehensive information about the system's global state and future implications, not just immediate fits.
*   **Avoid:** Relying on fixed, static rules (e.g., Best Fit). Preconceived notions about the superiority of simple linear or non-linear functions for priority. Making performance claims based on limited empirical observations or specific algorithm names.
*   **Explanation:** This approach encourages exploring a broader design space, developing more robust and intelligent heuristics by considering the evolving problem context and integrating richer information, leading to genuinely novel solutions.
