**Analysis:**
Comparing (Heuristics 1st) vs (Heuristics 20th), we see that the simplest Best Fit (H1), which minimizes absolute remaining capacity, significantly outperforms a more complex "Adaptive Best Fit" (H20). H20 attempts to dynamically bias item placement for smaller items into fuller bins, but its elaborate formula with parameters like `K` and reliance on `BIN_CAPACITY` appears to lead to worse performance. This suggests that over-engineering or adding complex adaptive factors without precise tuning can be detrimental.

Comparing (Heuristics 2nd) vs (Heuristics 17th), both aim for bin consolidation but with different mechanisms. Heuristic 2 adds an explicit "Bin Completion Bonus" to already full bins, while Heuristic 17 (identical to H20) applies a dynamic penalty based on current bin capacity and item size. Heuristic 2's bonus-based approach is ranked higher, indicating that encouraging desired states through positive reinforcement (a bonus for being full) may be more effective than complex, dynamically scaled penalties.

Comparing (Heuristics 1st) vs (Heuristics 2nd), pure Best Fit (H1) is slightly superior to Best Fit with an added Bin Completion Bonus (H2). This suggests that for this problem, the direct greedy objective of minimizing the immediate remaining space (Best Fit) might be more robust and effective than trying to enforce a global "bin completion" strategy with a fixed `beta` parameter. Simplicity often provides a robust baseline.

Comparing (Heuristics 3rd) vs (Heuristics 4th), Heuristic 3 attempts to refine Best Fit by penalizing small remnants and strongly prioritizing perfect fits (assigning `np.inf`). Heuristic 4 is functionally almost identical to Heuristic 1 (pure Best Fit). The ranking indicates that Heuristic 3's aggressive perfect fit prioritization and small remnant penalty, while intuitive, is slightly less effective than pure Best Fit, perhaps due to unintended side effects of diverting items from locally optimal (but not perfectly fitting) bins.

Comparing (Heuristics 6th) vs (Heuristics 17th), "Proportional Best Fit" (H6, 7, 9, 10, 11) is ranked notably higher than the "Adaptive Best Fit" (H17-20). This implies that maximizing the proportion of remaining capacity filled is a better strategy than the dynamic adaptive approach of H17-20, even if it's still inferior to standard Best Fit.

Comparing (Heuristics 16th) vs (Heuristics 20th), the absolute lowest-ranked heuristics (H12-16) are incomplete, lacking the core logic for placing items beyond a basic invalid item check. This fundamental flaw explains their worst-in-class performance. Heuristics 17-20 are fully implemented but still perform poorly, highlighting that a complete implementation of a suboptimal heuristic is still worse than an incomplete one (if no items can be placed).

Overall: Simple Best Fit (minimizing absolute remaining capacity) appears to be the most robust and effective. Attempts to add complexity, such as dynamic penalties or less direct proportional fits, often lead to worse performance unless extremely well-tuned. Aggressive prioritization of perfect fits is somewhat beneficial but not consistently better than pure Best Fit. Finally, correctly implementing the core logic is paramount.

**Experience:**
For bin packing heuristics, start with simple Best Fit; it's robust. Additive bonuses (e.g., for bin completion) can be beneficial, but complex adaptive penalties often hinder performance. Prioritize perfect fits strongly. Always validate that the core logic for valid placements is complete. Parameter tuning is crucial for complex heuristics.
