    we seek to minimize the "energy" (wasted space) within each bin.

    Bins that cannot accommodate the item are effectively 'forbidden' as they
    would lead to an unstable configuration (overflow) and are assigned the
    lowest possible priority, akin to highly unstable radioactive isotopes.
    Among the bins where the item fits, the higher priority is given to the one
    that achieves the tightest fit, thus optimizing the bin's fill level and
    conserving overall space, much like a dense, well-organized crystalline structure.

    As Isaac Newton, I view the Universe, and indeed problems such as Bin Packing,
    as systems that strive towards an optimal state of arrangement and efficiency.
    My heuristic for prioritizing bins is inspired by the principle of 'Best Fit',
    which in my physical understanding, aligns with minimizing potential energy
    or waste within a system.

    Imagine each bin as a potential well, and the item as a body seeking to fall
    into the shallowest suitable well. The most 'attractive' bin is not merely
    one that can contain the item, but one that snugly contains it, leaving the
    least 'void' or 'unused potential'. This tight packing minimizes the
    'gravitational pull' for future items to gravitate towards newly opened bins,
    thus conserving the total number of containers required.

    The priority for a suitable bin is calculated as the negative of the
    remaining capacity after the item is placed. This converts the pursuit of
    the *minimum* wasted space into a *maximization* problem, where the bin with
    the highest priority (i.e., the least negative remaining space) is chosen.
    Bins that are too small to accommodate the item are given an infinitely
    low priority, rendering them impenetrable barriers.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
For bin packing, the robust and simple Best Fit heuristic (linear penalty for wasted space) often outperforms non-linear priority functions. Overly aggressive or subtle non-linear weighting can hinder overall packing efficiency; a balanced, direct relationship to remaining capacity proves more effective.

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

    This function embodies the principle of "optimal packing" by favoring bins
    that, after accommodating the incoming item, will be left with the smallest
    possible remaining capacity. Think of it as striving for atomic stability:
    we seek to minimize the "energy" (wasted space) within each bin.

    Bins that cannot accommodate the item are effectively 'forbidden' as they
    would lead to an unstable configuration (overflow) and are assigned the
    lowest possible priority, akin to highly unstable radioactive isotopes.
    Among the bins where the item fits, the higher priority is given to the one
    that achieves the tightest fit, thus optimizing the bin's fill level and
    conserving overall space, much like a dense, well-organized crystalline structure.

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing Heuristics 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th: These heuristics are functionally identical, all implementing the classic "Best Fit" strategy. They assign a priority as the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item (`-(bins_remain_cap - item)`). A perfect fit results in a priority of 0, while larger remaining capacities yield increasingly negative priorities. The differences among them are purely cosmetic (docstrings, comments, variable names) or minor syntactic variations (e.g., using `np.where` vs. direct boolean masking), which do not alter the core logic. Their consistent high ranking indicates the strong efficacy and robustness of this specific linear priority function.

Comparing 1st (Best Fit) vs 4th (Feynman): The 1st heuristic uses a linear negative relationship to remaining space, while the 4th heuristic uses an inverse relationship: `1.0 / (remaining_space + 1e-9)`. This inverse function creates a significantly non-linear priority scaling. A perfect fit receives an extremely high priority, and priorities drop off very steeply even for slightly larger remaining capacities. The fact that the 4th heuristic is ranked lower suggests that this aggressive, non-linear amplification of "best fits" might be detrimental. It could lead to a greedy approach that is too focused on immediate, near-perfect fits, potentially preventing better overall packing by leaving less optimal but still viable options for subsequent items.

Comparing 1st (Best Fit) vs 11th-20th (Quantum): While the 1st heuristic maintains a linear negative priority, the 11th-20th heuristics employ an exponential decay function: `np.exp(-(remaining_capacity - item))`. This also introduces a non-linear weighting, where a perfect fit yields a priority of 1.0, and values decay exponentially towards zero for looser fits. The consistently lower ranking of this exponential approach compared to the linear Best Fit suggests that this smoother, non-linear decay also performs worse. It might not differentiate sufficiently among various levels of "goodness" for non-perfect fits, or its curve might not align optimally with the problem's combinatorial nature, leading to suboptimal overall solutions.

Overall: The results strongly demonstrate that the classic Best Fit heuristic, which uses a simple linear inverse relationship between priority and remaining capacity, is empirically superior for this bin packing scenario. Non-linear transformations of the priority function (like inverse or exponential scaling) appear to degrade performance, likely by distorting the relative desirability of bins in a way that doesn't lead to optimal global packing.

Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Directness, Robustness, Interpretability, Proportionality.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with simple, direct functions linearly proportional to key problem objectives. Prioritize interpretability and robustness; add complexity incrementally only if clear performance gains are proven.
*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary non-linear weighting or excessive parameterization without strong theoretical justification. Such approaches often introduce fragility, obscure decision logic, and hinder generalizability.
*   **Explanation:** Best Fit's robustness underscores that transparent, proportional relationships to problem state (e.g., remaining capacity) yield superior performance across diverse instances. Non-linearities can often distort this, leading to brittle or sub-optimal decision-making.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a Best Fit (BF) strategy.

    Bins where the item fits perfectly get the highest priority. Among bins where the item fits,
    those leaving less remaining capacity are preferred. Bins where the item does not fit
    are assigned the lowest possible priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item in each bin
    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priority scores
    # We use -np.inf for bins where the item cannot fit, ensuring they are never chosen.
    # For bins where it fits, we prioritize by minimizing the remaining space.
    # A smaller remaining_after_placement value means a better fit (closer to zero).
    # To maximize this as a priority score, we take the negative of remaining_after_placement.
    # So, a perfect fit (remaining_after_placement = 0) gets a priority of 0,
    # a near-perfect fit (e.g., remaining_after_placement = 0.1) gets -0.1,
    # and a loose fit (e.g., remaining_after_placement = 10) gets -10.
    # The higher the value (closer to 0 for negatives, or 0 itself), the better.
    priorities = -remaining_after_placement

    # Set priority to negative infinity for bins where the item does not fit
    # (i.e., remaining_after_placement is negative)
    priorities[remaining_after_placement < 0] = -np.inf

    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Directness, Robustness, Interpretability, Proportionality.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with simple, direct functions linearly proportional to key problem objectives. Prioritize interpretability and robustness; add complexity incrementally only if clear performance gains are proven.
*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary non-linear weighting or excessive parameterization without strong theoretical justification. Such approaches often introduce fragility, obscure decision logic, and hinder generalizability.
*   **Explanation:** Best Fit's robustness underscores that transparent, proportional relationships to problem state (e.g., remaining capacity) yield superior performance across diverse instances. Non-linearities can often distort this, leading to brittle or sub-optimal decision-making.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
