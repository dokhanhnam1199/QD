Prioritize perfect fits and minimize wasted space. Heavily penalize infeasible bins. Simple scaling works better.

Prioritize minimal waste. Avoid targeting specific remaining capacity percentages, which can be suboptimal.

Prioritize feasibility and balance remaining capacity. Penalize near-full bins and infeasible choices.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Control fragmentation by limiting remaining space.

The better code normalizes within-fitting bins and incentivizes filling existing, mid-fullness bins. Avoids penalizing non-fitting bins.

Tighter fit, normalized remaining capacity, dynamic scaling with fill ratio, and handling infeasibility improve heuristic design.

Tighter fit with relative normalization and moderate fill levels are key improvements.

Tighter fit, fill level penalty, and proximity score improve bin selection. Normalization is also key.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Adapt bin selection based on average remaining capacity. Scale priorities effectively.

Prioritize waste, fill-level; penalize fragmentation and empty bins. Explicit feasibility checks are crucial.
