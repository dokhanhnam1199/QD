Prioritize perfect fits and heavily penalize infeasible placements. Use wasted space to rank feasible bins.

Prioritize good fits based on a percentage of bin size. Penalize bad fits directly.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, balance fill levels, and penalize empty bins for consolidation.

Focus on feasibility, remaining capacity, and rewarding near-full bins while penalizing near-empty ones.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Control fragmentation using mean remaining capacity. Normalize priorities to scale better.

Prioritize fit, balance remaining capacity, avoid near-full bins, and eliminate infeasible options. Normalization is key.

Prioritize feasibility. Directly optimize for minimal waste and fragmentation. Dynamically scale priorities based on bin states.

Focus on remaining space minimization (first-fit decreasing idea) and avoid complex scoring functions.

Prioritize feasibility. Use fill-rate and remaining capacity for nuanced bin selection. Consider best-fit bonuses.

Prioritize tight fits using ratio-based metrics. Scale priorities and handle infeasibility gracefully, favoring largest remaining capacity.
