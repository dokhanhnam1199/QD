Focus on normalized remaining capacity, medium fill levels, and bin utilization when no fit exists.

The better code prioritizes tighter fits and medium fill levels. Consider fill level relative to maximum capacity.

The better code normalizes remaining capacity, dynamically adjusts priorities based on fill levels, and handles infeasible bins more gracefully.

Prioritize tighter fits and medium-full bins. Normalize by bin capacity, not max capacity.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits with large rewards. Use scaled remaining space for granular prioritization.

Prioritize perfect fits and minimize wasted space directly. Avoid complex mean-based comparisons.

Prioritize perfect fits, minimize waste directly, and strongly discourage infeasible placements with large constant values.

Prioritize minimizing waste. Directly using remaining capacity as a negative priority is effective.

Tighter fit, relative normalization, and balanced bin utilization are key for online bin packing.

Normalization, dynamic thresholds, and balancing remaining capacity with small incentives improve bin packing.
