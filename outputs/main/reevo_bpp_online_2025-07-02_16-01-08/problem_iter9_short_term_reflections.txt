*   **Normalization:** Use `max(bins_remain_cap)` instead of original bin capacity.
*   **Penalties:** More targeted penalties and adjusting priority range helps.

Prioritize near-perfect fits with bonuses. Penalize bins that cannot fit items heavily.

Normalization, fill-level consideration, and handling infeasibility differently improve bin packing heuristic performance.

Focus on normalized remaining capacity and bin fill level relative to maximum capacity, with penalties for near-full or empty bins.

Better code: Normalizes remaining capacity, uses exponential perfect-fit bonus, and refines fullness bonus.

Better code: Exponential perfect-fit bonus, normalized remaining capacity, and fill-level penalty improve performance.

Prioritize perfect fits and minimize wasted space. Heavily penalize bins that cannot fit the item.

Focus on waste minimization (post-fit), near-perfect fits, and penalizing infeasible placements drastically.

Consider normalized remaining capacity, bin fill level, and alternative strategies when no fit exists.

Prioritize tight/perfect fits, penalize overfull/empty bins, and strongly penalize infeasible solutions.
