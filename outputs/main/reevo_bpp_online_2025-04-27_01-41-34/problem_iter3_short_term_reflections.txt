Better: Gaussian-based fit, penalizing tight fits. Worse: Linear waste-based fit, crude fill penalties. Consider fragmentation.

Prioritize fitting bins. Minimize waste, favoring bins with smaller remaining space after packing.

Better heuristic: Use exponential similarity to item size, and a bonus for emptier bins. Avoid hard cutoffs.

The better code uses a more nuanced, targeted approach to remaining capacity, penalizing fragmentation and rewarding good fits.

Prioritize fitting. Maximize bin utilization directly. Avoid hardcoded penalties and thresholds.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, strongly penalize unfit bins, and add a tie-breaking bonus for emptier bins.

Consider moderate remaining capacity, penalize tight fits, and exclude infeasible bins entirely.

Prioritize tight fits and penalize barely-fitting items. Use more nuanced priority scores, and avoid unnecessary computations.

Waste-based prioritization is good. Also consider item fit ratio and avoid division by zero.

The better code combines multiple bin-packing strategies (FF, RC, BF, WF) and adds randomness for improved exploration.
