Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits, penalize barely-fits, and use large constant multipliers to enforce constraints.

The improved code normalizes the tie-breaking bonus and avoids redundant multiplication by `item`, thus performing better.

Focus on near-perfect fits, simplify rewards, and prioritize emptier bins for tie-breaking.

Gaussian fit, `np.inf` penalty, and tie-breaking bonus using relative emptiness improved performance by focusing on near-perfect fits.

1. **Use `-np.inf` for infeasibility.**
2. **Normalize tie-breaking bonuses.**
3. **Adjust `std_dev` for tighter fits.**

Gaussian fit, negative infinity for infeasibility, and tie-breaking bonus based on emptiness improve performance.

Prioritize feasibility, then use a smooth, tuned function (e.g., Gaussian) of remaining space, plus tiebreakers.

The better code prioritizes exact/tight fits, penalizes barely fitting, and uses exponential waste prioritization.

Prioritize near-perfect fits highly and good fits moderately. Use bin capacity as a tie-breaker.

Focus on fitting items tightly, balancing exploration, and promoting bin diversity. Avoid unnecessary computations.
