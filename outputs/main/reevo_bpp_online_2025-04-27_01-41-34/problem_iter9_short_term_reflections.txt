1. Use large negative values for infeasible solutions.
2. Normalize bonus using `1 - (current_value/max_value)` rather than `(current_value/max_value)`.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, strongly penalize unfit bins, and normalize tie-breaking bonuses. Smaller std_dev may help.

Gaussian-like priority focuses near-perfect fits better. Negative infinity replaced with a large negative number stabilizes unfit bins.

Prioritize infeasibility more strictly, sharpen the near-fit Gaussian, and reward nearly-full bins after placement.

The better code uses a focused Gaussian fit, avoids unnecessary penalties, and scales tie-breakers effectively.

Prioritize exact/tight fits, penalize barely fits, and exponentially scale best-fit rewards for improved bin packing.

Fill ratio rewards, random exploration, and penalizing low-capacity bins improve performance.

Prioritize feasibility absolutely. Sharper Gaussian, normalized tie-breaking, and avoid division by zero are crucial improvements.

Gaussian-like fit scoring, combined with infeasibility penalties and tie-breaking, improves bin selection.

Explicitly prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits, penalize barely-fits, and use large constant multipliers for importance.
