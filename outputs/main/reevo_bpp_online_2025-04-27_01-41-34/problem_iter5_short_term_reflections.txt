Prioritize near-perfect fits, strongly penalize unfit bins, and break ties using emptier bins.

Focus on relevant features (remaining capacity, fill ratio), tuned weights, and reduced anti-exploration.

Prioritize feasibility. Heavily reward tight/exact fits, penalize barely fits, and avoid fragmentation. Use clear rules with meaningful magnitudes.

Exploration, fitting distribution, fullness bonus, and infeasibility handling improve bin selection for online BPP.

Target specific remaining capacities and penalize tight fits to improve bin utilization and reduce fragmentation.

Focus on hard constraints first. Use discrete rules with high rewards/penalties for clear objectives.

Focus on near-perfect fits, break ties favoring emptier bins, and avoid penalties unless well-justified.

Prioritize near-perfect fits. Penalize unfit bins. Add tie-breaking bonuses based on bin emptiness.

The better code uses a Gaussian-like priority to target bins with moderate remaining capacity, reducing fragmentation.

The better code prioritizes near-perfect fits with a Gaussian distribution and adds a tie-breaking bonus for emptier bins.
