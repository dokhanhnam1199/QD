**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of waste, fit and capacity utilization with carefully chosen weights, while the worst uses only the log ratio of item size to bin capacity, lacking nuanced considerations. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see the second best uses perfect fit, best fit, utilization ratio, waste minimization and avoid nearly full bin; the second worst uses the log ratio of item size to bin capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best heuristic uses a gaussian fit score while the second best uses perfect fit score. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd and 4th is quite similar, but the 4th has adaptive weights based on item size and bin utilization while the 3rd one only utilizes item size for adaptive weighting. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both the same function, and they are the most simple functions. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors (waste, fit, utilization) and use adaptive weighting based on item size and/or bin utilization to achieve better packing, while the worst heuristics use only a single, simple metric, often neglecting important considerations like fragmentation or bin utilization.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, using adaptive weights to adjust the influence of each factor based on the specific problem instance. Employing more complex scoring mechanism such as Gaussian fit score will also improve the performance.
