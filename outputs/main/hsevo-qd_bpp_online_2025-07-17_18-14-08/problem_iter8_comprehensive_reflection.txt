Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more actionable for designing better heuristics, keeping in mind what to avoid from the "Ineffective Self-Reflection".

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, multi-objective optimization, dynamic weighting, performance feedback.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust their behavior based on real-time performance metrics and problem characteristics. Focus on identifying key features of the problem instance that influence heuristic effectiveness.
*   **Avoid:** Predefined static weights or bonuses/penalties without data-driven justification. Vague calls for "balance" without specifying how to achieve it.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of hand-tuning, aim for self-tuning heuristics. Collect data on heuristic performance during execution and use that data to refine parameters (e.g., using reinforcement learning or online optimization).
