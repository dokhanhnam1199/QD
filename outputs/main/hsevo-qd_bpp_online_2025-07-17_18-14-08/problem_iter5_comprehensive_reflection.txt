Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" focusing on actionable insights for better heuristic design in bin packing, while avoiding the vagueness of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a refined perspective:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, combined metrics, dynamic weighting, item characteristics.
*   **Advice:** Implement a system that adjusts the importance of different bin-packing strategies (best-fit, perfect-fit, waste minimization) based on the size distribution or other relevant features of the items being packed.
*   **Avoid:** Relying on static or pre-determined combinations of strategies.
*   **Explanation:** A heuristic that intelligently switches or blends approaches based on the input data's characteristics is more likely to perform well across diverse problem instances.
