Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, steering clear of the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Context-aware, Refinement.
*   **Advice:** Integrate multiple, relevant factors into a combined evaluation using adaptive strategies.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on fixed weights, simplistic metrics, or singular strategies.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static, one-size-fits-all approaches. Design heuristics that dynamically adjust based on specific problem characteristics, promoting nuanced decision-making and improved results through constant refinement.
