Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls, geared towards designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, adaptive weights, iterative refinement, problem context, performance bottlenecks.
*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple heuristic, rigorously test, and *incrementally* add complexity only when performance requires it. Dynamically adjust factor weights based on real-time problem state.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, static weighting schemes, focusing solely on individual factors in isolation.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should evolve from simple, testable foundations. Adaptation based on the *current* problem instance is key. Prioritize addressing proven performance shortcomings over preemptive complexification.
