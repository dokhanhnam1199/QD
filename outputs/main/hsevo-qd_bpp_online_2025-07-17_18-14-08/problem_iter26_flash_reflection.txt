**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the primary difference is the inclusion of a "diversity score" based on the standard deviation of remaining bin capacities in the 1st heuristic. This suggests an attempt to balance bin utilization across all available bins.

Comparing (2nd) vs (5th), these are identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), they are identical.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical.

Comparing (4th) vs (6th), they are identical.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th), they are identical.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), they are identical.

Comparing (8th) vs (9th), the 8th uses a more intricate and adaptive weighting scheme based on item size, incorporating waste, fit, capacity utilization, and remaining capacity. The 9th uses a simplified fixed weighting.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), both combine waste, fit, and capacity utilization, but (9th) includes "adaptive weighting" even though it's just a fixed weighting. (10th) does not claim adaptive weighting and simply uses fixed weights.

Comparing (10th) vs (13th), these are identical.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), The 11th has waste_score calculation while the 12th doesn't.

Comparing (12th) vs (15th), these are identical.

Comparing (14th) vs (16th), The 14th uses a complex system of adaptive weights based on both item size and bin utilization, and a lot of parameters, while the 16th uses adaptive weights based only on item size. Also, the 14th introduces several parameters that need to be fine-tuned.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), The 16th is a more developed heuristic that adapts to cases where the item doesn't fit, while the 17th focuses on waste minimization, gaussian fit score, and capacity utilization when the item fits.

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), the 18th attempts adaptive weighting (though simplified), the 17th uses a fixed weighting.

Comparing (18th) vs (19th), The 18th is a multifactorial approach combining waste, fit, and capacity utilization, while the 19th is a single-factor approach based solely on the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. Also, (18th) use adaptive weighting while (19th) doesn't.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), these are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics generally incorporate more factors (waste, fit, capacity utilization, remaining capacity, bin diversity) and employ adaptive weighting schemes based on item size and bin utilization. Simpler heuristics focus on fewer factors with fixed weights or a single factor. The best heuristic attempts to balance bin utilization by penalizing low diversity of bin capacities.

**Experience:**
Multifactorial heuristics with adaptive weighting based on item characteristics and bin states tend to perform better in bin packing. Introducing diversity measures of available bins further improves performance. Explicitly handling cases where no bin can currently fit the item is also beneficial.
