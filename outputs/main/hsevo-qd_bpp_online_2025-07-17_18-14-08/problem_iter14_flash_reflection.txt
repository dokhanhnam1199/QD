**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st heuristic uses a combination of perfect fit, best fit, utilization ratio, waste minimization (exponential decay), and nearly full avoidance, while the 20th heuristic simply calculates the negative log of the ratio between item size and remaining bin capacity. The 1st is much more comprehensive.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd heuristic calculates waste score, fit score (Gaussian), capacity utilization and employs item size-adaptive weighting. The 19th heuristic calculates the negative log of the ratio between item size and remaining bin capacity. The 2nd is much more comprehensive.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st heuristic directly adds/subtracts values to/from the priorities based on specific conditions like perfect fit or nearly full avoidance, whereas the 2nd heuristic uses a combination of waste score, fit score and capacity utilization score with adaptive weighting. The 2nd heuristic using score combination may have a better balance.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd heuristic combines waste, fit, and capacity utilization scores, while the 4th heuristic considers perfect fit, best fit, utilization ratio, waste minimization and nearly full avoidance.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the 2nd heuristic incorporates adaptive weighting based on the size of the item relative to the bins, while the 3rd uses static weights. This suggests the dynamic weights are better.

Comparing (8th) vs (9th), the 8th has more parameters and weights for combined score, and the 9th is simpler.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), the 10th and 8th are same, the 11th and the rest from here are similar.

Overall:
The better heuristics consider multiple factors such as perfect fit, best fit, waste minimization, capacity utilization, and near-full avoidance. They also incorporate adaptive weighting based on item size and bin capacity. The weaker heuristics tend to focus on a single metric, such as the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. The Gaussian fit score is also effective.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using a weighted scoring system. Adaptive weighting based on problem context (e.g., item size relative to bin capacities) can significantly improve performance.
