Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The more complex scaling and penalization in 2nd are beneficial.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see 1st uses exponential decay for waste minimization and combines capacity and waste scores, while 2nd focuses on scaling based on bin fullness after packing and penalizing bins that are too large or empty. The difference lies in the specific functions used to combine capacity and waste.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see 3rd gives high priority to bins that can fit the item with small waste and penalizes bins that cannot fit, while 4th prioritizes based on perfect fit, best fit, utilization ratio, and avoids nearly full bins. 4th uses specific bonuses and penalties, while 3rd is simpler with waste minimization.\n\nComparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we see that 2nd uses a squared ratio and capacity normalization, while 3rd uses simple inverse of waste and assigns binary priorities based on nearly full condition.\n\nComparing (19th) vs (20th), we see that 19th uses the log ratio, while 20th computes the priority based on remaining capacity, item/cap ratio and penalizes similar sized bins as the items.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics incorporate a balance between remaining capacity, waste minimization, and avoidance of nearly full bins, often using exponential functions or scaling to fine-tune the priorities. Simpler approaches such as just log ratio are less effective. The best heuristics contain several components of First-Fit-Decreasing and Best-Fit. The more elaborate and fine-grained that the penalties were, the better.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine current self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Iterative, Performance Metrics, Solution Space Analysis.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics iteratively, using performance metrics to guide refinements. Analyze the solution space to understand heuristic behavior. Adapt the heuristic's parameters based on feedback.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, neglecting edge cases, rigid parameter settings, lack of performance tracking.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static combinations. Focus on adaptive strategies that learn from past performance, explore the solution space effectively, and dynamically adjust to different problem instances.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
