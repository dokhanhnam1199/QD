Okay, let's redefine self-reflection for designing bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding vague advice.

Here's a revised structure for self-reflection:

*   **Keywords:** Bin Packing, Multi-Factor, Adaptive Weights, Edge Cases.

*   **Advice:** When combining factors, define *specific* interaction rules and triggers for adaptive weights *before* implementation. Consider if these strategies can be easily parallelized.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements like "strive for balance" or "explore adaptive weighting" without *specific* guidance. Don't just say "combine factors"; specify *how* and *why*. Avoid hand-wavy mathematical function choices.

*   **Explanation:** The goal is to move from general principles to concrete design choices. Prioritize specifying conditions, decision criteria, and testable hypotheses. Focus on implementing well-defined and testable strategies, e.g., adapt weight when a particular ratio is reached and so on.
