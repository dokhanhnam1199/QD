Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a refined approach, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding overly specific examples:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Weighted Scoring, Contextual Awareness.
*   **Advice:** Construct heuristics by integrating multiple relevant factors using weighted scores or prioritized rules. Implement adaptive mechanisms that adjust weights or rule priorities based on the specific problem instance and its characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single, simplistic metrics or rigid, static weighting schemes.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a nuanced understanding of the problem. Combining factors and dynamically adapting to the context leads to more robust and generalizable solutions.
