**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see 1st uses a combined score of capacity and waste, with exponential decay for waste close to 0, while 20th prioritizes based on remaining capacity, item/cap ratio, and penalizes similar sized bins. 1st's approach of combining capacity and waste appears more effective.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see 2nd prioritizes bins that fit the item well and aren't too empty afterwards with scaling and negative penalization, while 19th simply uses log ratios of item size to remaining capacity. The more complex scaling and penalization in 2nd are beneficial.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see 1st uses exponential decay for waste minimization and combines capacity and waste scores, while 2nd focuses on scaling based on bin fullness after packing and penalizing bins that are too large or empty. The difference lies in the specific functions used to combine capacity and waste.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see 3rd gives high priority to bins that can fit the item with small waste and penalizes bins that cannot fit, while 4th prioritizes based on perfect fit, best fit, utilization ratio, and avoids nearly full bins. 4th uses specific bonuses and penalties, while 3rd is simpler with waste minimization.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we see that 2nd uses a squared ratio and capacity normalization, while 3rd uses simple inverse of waste and assigns binary priorities based on nearly full condition.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), we see that 19th uses the log ratio, while 20th computes the priority based on remaining capacity, item/cap ratio and penalizes similar sized bins as the items.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a balance between remaining capacity, waste minimization, and avoidance of nearly full bins, often using exponential functions or scaling to fine-tune the priorities. Simpler approaches such as just log ratio are less effective. The best heuristics contain several components of First-Fit-Decreasing and Best-Fit. The more elaborate and fine-grained that the penalties were, the better.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider combining multiple factors such as capacity, waste, and bin utilization. Use scaling and fine-grained bonuses/penalties (e.g. exponential decay) to create nuanced priority scores. Avoid overly simplistic approaches and strive for balance in the heuristic's design.
