**Analysis:**

*   **(1st) vs (20th):** The best heuristic uses a combination of waste score, fit score, and capacity utilization, with adaptive weighting based on the item size relative to the maximum bin capacity. It also handles the case where no bin can accommodate the item. The worst heuristic simply calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.
*   **(2nd) vs (19th):** The second-best heuristic refines the approach of the best one but does not have additional logic to handle when no bins can accommodate the item. It uses slightly different adaptive weighting and fit score calculations. The 19th heuristic, like the 20th, uses only the log ratio calculation, which is overly simplistic.
*   **(3rd) vs (18th):** The third-best heuristic is very similar to the first, including the handling of cases where no bin can fit the item. The 18th is similar to the 19th and 20th.
*   **(4th) vs (17th):** The 4th heuristic still considers waste, fit, and capacity, and utilizes item size adaptive weighting. But this adaptive weighting mechanism compares item size with the *mean* of bin capacities, which can be less effective than comparing with the maximum capacity. The 17th uses only the log ratio.
*   **(5th) vs (16th):** The fifth-best simplifies the adaptive weighting part of the best ones, assigning fixed weights. The 16th uses the single log ratio.
*   **(6th) vs (15th):** The sixth-best heuristic introduces the concept of perfect fit, best fit, and utilization ratio, penalizing waste and nearly full bins. 15th is the log ratio.
*   **(7th) vs (14th):** 7th is almost as good as first. It improves upon previous heuristics by incorporating a "remaining capacity score" and adjusting the weights based on the item size relative to the *average* bin capacity (a detail that makes it less effective than using max bin capacity).
*   **(8th) vs (13th):** The 8th heuristic is similar to the top ones in that it uses waste score, fit score and capacity utilization, and provides configurable parameters, but lacks adaptive weighting based on item size, making it less flexible. The 13th calculates only the log ratio.
*   **(9th) vs (12th):** The 9th one is just like the 2nd one. The 12th calculates the log ratio.
*   **(10th) vs (11th):** The 10th heuristic combines perfect fit, best fit, and adaptive weighting based on average utilization. However, its adaptive weighting only adjusts based on a high average utilization, instead of item size. The 11th uses the log ratio calculation.

Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors such as waste, fit, and capacity utilization. Adaptive weighting based on the item size relative to the bin capacities (especially max capacity) improves performance. Handling edge cases, such as no bins fitting the item, is also beneficial. Simpler heuristics that rely on a single metric such as log ratios perform poorly.

**Experience:**

For effective bin packing heuristics, consider a combination of waste minimization, good fit, and capacity utilization. Adapt the weights of these factors based on item size relative to max bin size. Also, explicitly handle situations where no bin can currently accommodate the item.
