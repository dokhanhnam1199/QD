{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, using adaptive weights to adjust the influence of each factor based on the specific problem instance. Employing more complex scoring mechanism such as Gaussian fit score will also improve the performance.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider combining multiple factors such as capacity, waste, and bin utilization. Use scaling and fine-grained bonuses/penalties (e.g. exponential decay) to create nuanced priority scores. Avoid overly simplistic approaches and strive for balance in the heuristic's design.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, combining multiple strategies such as best-fit, perfect-fit, and waste minimization often yields better results than relying on a single metric. Consider using adaptive weighting based on item characteristics can improve performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors into a comprehensive scoring function. Experiment with different weighting schemes and adaptive parameters to optimize performance. Prioritize strategies that minimize waste, promote good fit, and maximize capacity utilization.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using weighted scores or priority systems. Explore adaptive weighting mechanisms to adjust the heuristic's behavior based on input characteristics. Avoid relying on single, simplistic ratios or metrics, as they often lack the necessary nuance for effective decision-making.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using a weighted scoring system. Adaptive weighting based on problem context (e.g., item size relative to bin capacities) can significantly improve performance.\n\nFor effective bin packing heuristics, consider a combination of waste minimization, good fit, and capacity utilization. Adapt the weights of these factors based on item size relative to max bin size. Also, explicitly handle situations where no bin can currently accommodate the item.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
