**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach combining perfect fit, best fit, utilization ratio, waste minimization, and avoidance of nearly full bins, while the worst uses a simple log ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that the second-best considers waste, fit (Gaussian), and capacity utilization with tunable weights, while second worst only considers log ratio. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best uses hardcoded priorities and conditions, where as the second best uses weighted scores. (3rd) vs (4th) shows adaptive weighting can be useful. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both using the same log ratio calculations. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors (waste, fit, capacity utilization, perfect fit) using weighted scores or priority systems, while worse heuristics rely on single ratios and lack adaptability or nuanced consideration of different bin-packing objectives. Adaptive weighting is also important.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using weighted scores or priority systems. Explore adaptive weighting mechanisms to adjust the heuristic's behavior based on input characteristics. Avoid relying on single, simplistic ratios or metrics, as they often lack the necessary nuance for effective decision-making.
