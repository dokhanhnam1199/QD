**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of waste score, fit score, and capacity utilization, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that the 2nd best uses a rule-based approach with hardcoded priorities for perfect fit, best fit, and penalizes nearly full bins in contrast to the ratio based strategy of the second worst. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the top heuristic uses a combined score with weighted components for waste, fit, and utilization while the second uses discrete rules and prioritized perfect fit. (3rd) vs (4th) is not very insightful because they are the same. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the only difference is the import statements at the top. Overall: the better heuristics use more sophisticated scoring mechanisms that take into account multiple factors such as waste, fit, and utilization, often combining them with weighted averages or rule-based priorities. Worse heuristics rely on simplistic ratios. Introduction of adaptive weighting and gaussian fit scaling in some cases makes performance better.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors into a comprehensive scoring function. Experiment with different weighting schemes and adaptive parameters to optimize performance. Prioritize strategies that minimize waste, promote good fit, and maximize capacity utilization.
