Okay, I'll craft a redefined self-reflection on heuristic design for bin packing, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.

**Redefined Self-Reflection:**

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive Weighting, Bin States, Diversity, Constraint Handling, Complex Scoring.

*   **Advice:** Integrate multiple, *independent* factors (item characteristics, bin state, diversity metrics). Adapt weights based on *dynamic* problem state using *non-linear* functions (e.g., Gaussian). Explicitly address infeasibility. Employ *complex* scoring mechanism such as Gaussian fit score.

*   **Avoid:** Vague "combinations," simplistic ratios, static weights, focusing *solely* on waste/capacity, neglecting diversity or infeasibility.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require combining diverse information signals. Adaptive weighting should dynamically respond to problem state. Infeasibility needs dedicated handling. Complexity, when justified by performance gains, is valuable.

I can further refine this if you give me specific areas you want me to focus on (e.g., types of diversity metrics, specific adaptive weighting functions, or methods for handling infeasibility). Let me know!
