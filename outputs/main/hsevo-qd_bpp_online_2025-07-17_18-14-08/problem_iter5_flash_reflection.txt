**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top-ranked heuristic `priority_v2` combines perfect-fit, best-fit, utilization ratio, waste minimization, and avoidance of nearly full bins, assigning different priorities. Conversely, the bottom-ranked heuristic calculates priorities based solely on the negative log of the ratio between item size and remaining bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) they are similar to (1st) and (20th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) they are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The best performing heuristics use a combination of different bin-packing strategies. The lowest performing heuristics use a single metric.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, combining multiple strategies such as best-fit, perfect-fit, and waste minimization often yields better results than relying on a single metric. Consider using adaptive weighting based on item characteristics can improve performance.
