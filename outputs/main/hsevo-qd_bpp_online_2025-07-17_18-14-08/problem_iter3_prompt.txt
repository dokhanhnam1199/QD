Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n       Tesla's embodiment of electrical elegance: A symphony of potential.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Avoid zero capacity bins and division by zero.\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    priorities = np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf)  # Default to negative infinity.\n\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        remaining_capacities = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]\n\n        # Calculate the waste if we place the item in each bin.

To give higher preference to minimal waste\n        waste_score = 1 / (waste + 1e-9) # Adding a small value to avoid division by zero\n        \n        # Fit Score\n        fit_score = np.exp(-(remaining_capacities - item)**2 / (2 * (item/3)**2)) # Gaussian Fit score favoring item to fit nicely in the bin.\n\n        # Preference for bins that can accommodate the item.

Analyze the solution space to understand heuristic behavior. Adapt the heuristic's parameters based on feedback.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, neglecting edge cases, rigid parameter settings, lack of performance tracking.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static combinations. Focus on adaptive strategies that learn from past performance, explore the solution space effectively, and dynamically adjust to different problem instances.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
