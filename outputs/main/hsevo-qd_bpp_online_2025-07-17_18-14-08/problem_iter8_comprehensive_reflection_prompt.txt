{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors into a comprehensive scoring function. Experiment with different weighting schemes and adaptive parameters to optimize performance. Prioritize strategies that minimize waste, promote good fit, and maximize capacity utilization.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider combining multiple factors such as capacity, waste, and bin utilization. Use scaling and fine-grained bonuses/penalties (e.g. exponential decay) to create nuanced priority scores. Avoid overly simplistic approaches and strive for balance in the heuristic's design.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, combining multiple strategies such as best-fit, perfect-fit, and waste minimization often yields better results than relying on a single metric. Consider using adaptive weighting based on item characteristics can improve performance.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
