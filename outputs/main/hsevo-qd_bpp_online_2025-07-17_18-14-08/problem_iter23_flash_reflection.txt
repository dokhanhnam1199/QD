**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see a significant difference in complexity and the factors considered. The 1st heuristic employs a multi-faceted, adaptive approach, incorporating waste score, fit score, capacity utilization, and remaining capacity, with weights dynamically adjusted based on item size. In contrast, the 20th heuristic uses a simple logarithmic ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.  (2nd best) vs (second worst) exhibits similar contrast.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the only difference is the ranking (both codes are identical), indicating that performance differences might be more dependent on external factors or other parts of the overall algorithm using this function rather than a specific change within this function itself. (3rd) vs (4th) again shows no difference in code, so the same logic applies.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they both implement the same simple logic using log ratios. The primary difference is the presence of `import` statements for `random`, `math`, `scipy`, and `torch` which are unused. These unnecessary imports could marginally impact performance, although likely insignificantly.

Overall: The better heuristics prioritize a blend of multiple factors, including waste minimization, goodness-of-fit (often modeled with a Gaussian), and capacity utilization, using adaptive weighting to adjust the influence of each factor based on the item size and bin states. They avoid overly simplistic single-factor approaches. The adaptive weighting mechanism is a key differentiator. Worse heuristics tend to rely on simpler calculations (e.g., simple ratios or log ratios) and lack adaptive components or multiple considerations.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider a multi-objective approach, dynamically adapting the weights of different factors based on problem context. Avoid over-simplification; integrate relevant factors and penalize undesirable outcomes. Start simple, test, then iteratively add complexity based on performance bottlenecks.
