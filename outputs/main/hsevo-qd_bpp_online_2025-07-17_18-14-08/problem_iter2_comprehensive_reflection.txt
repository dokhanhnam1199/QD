Okay, let's redefine current self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Iterative, Performance Metrics, Solution Space Analysis.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics iteratively, using performance metrics to guide refinements. Analyze the solution space to understand heuristic behavior. Adapt the heuristic's parameters based on feedback.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, neglecting edge cases, rigid parameter settings, lack of performance tracking.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static combinations. Focus on adaptive strategies that learn from past performance, explore the solution space effectively, and dynamically adjust to different problem instances.
