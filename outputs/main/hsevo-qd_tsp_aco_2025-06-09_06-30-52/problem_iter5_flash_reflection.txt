**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates a node degree penalty and scaling by the average distance, along with a small constant to prevent division by zero, while the worst simply returns the inverse of the distance matrix. This suggests that considering node connectivity and normalizing distances are crucial for good performance.
Comparing (2nd) vs (17th), the only difference are the docstrings, imports and defined default values of `avg_distance_weight` and `small_constant`.
Comparing (13th) vs (17th), we see that the 13th heuristic adds a local search inspired factor and sparsification, alongside the node degree penalty of the 1st heuristic. The 17th heuristic only calculates the inverse of the distance matrix. This suggests that adding local search factors and sparsification will improve performance of the heuristic.
Comparing (1st) vs (13th), we see that 13th heuristic adjust node degree threshold to `avg_distance * 1.5`, adds an exponent to the degree penalty and calculates a local search inspired factor. After computing the heuristics matrix, the function sparsifies the matrix by setting the lower values to zero. The 1st heuristics only calculates a node degree penalty to discourage subtours.

Overall: More sophisticated heuristics for the TSP consider not only the distance between nodes but also the network structure around each node and performs sparsification. Penalizing high-degree nodes and incorporating local search-inspired factors significantly improve the quality of the heuristic. Sparsification can help focusing the search on more promising edges.

**Experience:**
When designing TSP heuristics, go beyond simple inverse distance calculations. Incorporate node degree penalties, local search considerations, and sparsification techniques to guide the search more effectively and avoid suboptimal solutions such as subtours.
