**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the first heuristic incorporates a node degree penalty and scales it with the average distance to avoid premature subtours, while the 11th heuristic only considers the inverse distance. Comparing (2nd) vs (12th), (3rd) vs (13th), ..., (10th) vs (20th) we see the same pattern. The better heuristics attempt to incorporate more sophisticated problem-specific knowledge like node degree and average distance for scaling. The inferior heuristics all compute just the inverse of the distance matrix. These are equivalent. All of Heuristics 1st to 10th are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics attempt to incorporate more sophisticated problem-specific knowledge, such as a node degree penalty to discourage early subtours and scaling using average distances to make the heuristic scale-invariant. A major difference is in trying to prevent sub-cycles.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, start with a simple approach (like inverse distance) and then iteratively refine it by incorporating problem-specific knowledge and constraints. Consider factors beyond just the immediate edge cost, such as node degree or average distance, and use these factors to improve solution quality.
