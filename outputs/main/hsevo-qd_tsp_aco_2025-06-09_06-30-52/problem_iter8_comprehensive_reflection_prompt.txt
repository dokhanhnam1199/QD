{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for TSP should incorporate multiple factors like inverse distance, node degree penalty, and sparsification. Parameterizing key components such as weights, exponents, and percentiles allows for fine-tuning. Adding local factors improves the solution. Dynamically adjusting parameters based on local conditions and global distributions enhances performance.\n```\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a simple approach (like inverse distance) and then iteratively refine it by incorporating problem-specific knowledge and constraints. Consider factors beyond just the immediate edge cost, such as node degree or average distance, and use these factors to improve solution quality.\n\nWhen designing TSP heuristics, go beyond simple inverse distance calculations. Incorporate node degree penalties, local search considerations, and sparsification techniques to guide the search more effectively and avoid suboptimal solutions such as subtours.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
