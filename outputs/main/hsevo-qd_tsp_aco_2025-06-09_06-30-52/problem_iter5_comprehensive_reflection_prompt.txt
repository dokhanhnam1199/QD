{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing TSP heuristics, go beyond simple inverse distance calculations. Incorporate node degree penalties, local search considerations, and sparsification techniques to guide the search more effectively and avoid suboptimal solutions such as subtours.\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a simple approach (like inverse distance) and then iteratively refine it by incorporating problem-specific knowledge and constraints. Consider factors beyond just the immediate edge cost, such as node degree or average distance, and use these factors to improve solution quality.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
