- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" focusing on actionable insights for better heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of vague suggestions.

Here's a refined perspective, tailored for effective heuristic development:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem-specific knowledge, multi-objective factors, dynamic adaptation.
*   **Advice:** Start with a simple baseline heuristic. Iteratively add complexity based on *quantifiable* problem characteristics (e.g., degree distribution skewness). Experiment with multi-objective optimization incorporating constraints directly.
*   **Avoid:** Vague directives like "incorporate local factors." Instead, define *specific* local factors and *how* they will be used.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are built through a cycle of implementation, experimentation, and data-driven refinement, not abstract intuition. Focus on measurable improvements with each iteration.
