- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for designing heuristics, keeping your generous tip in mind!

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem-specific knowledge, constraint integration, global perspective, solution landscape.
*   **Advice:** Start with a basic heuristic, then iteratively refine it by incorporating constraints, considering global solution properties, and adapting based on the solution landscape.
*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on immediate edge costs, neglecting global solution structure, premature optimization, ignoring problem-specific insights.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection means systematically improving a heuristic by learning from both successful and failed iterations, considering a broader context, and deeply understanding problem constraints.
