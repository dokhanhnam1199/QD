**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates inverse distance, node degree penalty, sparsification, and cycle avoidance, while the worst simply returns the inverse of the distance matrix. (2nd) and (3rd) are identical, indicating redundancy or a lack of experimentation with different parameters. Comparing (1st) vs (6th), we see that dynamically adjusting the degree penalty based on local density and further sparsification based on global distance distribution helps improve the solution quality in (1st). (6th) parameterizes several key values. Comparing (6th) vs (8th), we observe that the (6th) uses tunable parameters for average distance weight, degree penalty exponent, sparsification percentile, and average distance threshold factor, whereas the (8th) uses fixed values. (10th) simplifies the heuristic to only inverse distance with node degree penalty. Comparing (1st) vs (10th), the sparsification techniques used in (1st) appear to offer further improvement. Comparing (17th) vs (18th), the consideration of local search factors and sparsification contribute to the superiority of (17th). Overall: the best heuristics balance edge desirability (inverse distance) with mechanisms to avoid subtours (node degree penalty) and sparsification to reduce the search space, while parameterization offers flexibility.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for TSP should incorporate multiple factors like inverse distance, node degree penalty, and sparsification. Parameterizing key components such as weights, exponents, and percentiles allows for fine-tuning. Adding local factors improves the solution. Dynamically adjusting parameters based on local conditions and global distributions enhances performance.
