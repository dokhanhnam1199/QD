- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine self-reflection for better heuristic design, avoiding common pitfalls and focusing on actionable insights.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem-specific knowledge, solution context, evaluation metrics, adaptive adjustment.
*   **Advice:** After establishing a baseline heuristic, rigorously analyze its weaknesses by understanding where the algorithm makes wrong calls. Then, inject problem-specific information related to these areas. Quantify improvements with pre-defined metrics.
*   **Avoid:** "Blind" refinement without analyzing current heuristic performance. Overfitting to limited training instances. Neglecting evaluation metrics.
*   **Explanation:** Current heuristic's decision patterns and weaknesses are thoroughly examined and addressed using tailored problem-specific knowledge. Evaluate performance based on defined metrics.
