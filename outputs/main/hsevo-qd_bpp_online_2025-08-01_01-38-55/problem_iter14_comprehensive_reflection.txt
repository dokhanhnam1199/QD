To redefine 'Current self-reflection' avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection' points:

*   **Keywords:** Emergent Properties, Adaptive Design, Global Context, Structural Integrity.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to foster beneficial emergent behaviors and maintain solution flexibility, prioritizing adaptive decision rules that consider global context over rigid local optimizations.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on isolated parameter tuning, prescriptive scoring functions for local "perfect fits," or specific algorithmic choices as universal solutions.
*   **Explanation:** A focus on systemic design and adaptability enables heuristics to navigate complex landscapes more effectively, preventing local optima traps and fostering robust, globally superior outcomes.
