Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,\n    implementing a Best-Fit-like heuristic.\n    Bins that fit the item are prioritized based on how little space\n    would be left after placing the item (i.e., tighter fits get higher scores).\n    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize all priorities to a very low number.

Favor simple, local rules that collectively yield robust global behavior. Incorporate mechanisms for recognizing and rectifying accumulating sub-optimality.\n*   **Avoid**: Prescribing fixed scoring biases, over-engineering perfect fit rewards, relying solely on pre-tuned parameters, or generic comparisons of complexity.\n*   **Explanation**: Focusing on dynamic adaptation and emergent properties fosters resilience. Rather than static optimization, heuristics should fluidly respond to changing problem landscapes, moving beyond rigid, pre-defined rules.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
