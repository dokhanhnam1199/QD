Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection':

*   **Keywords**: Adaptive strategies, emergent properties, state-aware, dynamic.
*   **Advice**: Design heuristics with inherent adaptability, allowing them to dynamically adjust priorities based on real-time state evolution. Favor simple, local rules that collectively yield robust global behavior. Incorporate mechanisms for recognizing and rectifying accumulating sub-optimality.
*   **Avoid**: Prescribing fixed scoring biases, over-engineering perfect fit rewards, relying solely on pre-tuned parameters, or generic comparisons of complexity.
*   **Explanation**: Focusing on dynamic adaptation and emergent properties fosters resilience. Rather than static optimization, heuristics should fluidly respond to changing problem landscapes, moving beyond rigid, pre-defined rules.
