Here's a redefined self-reflection focusing purely on the heuristic's strategic objectives and outcomes, avoiding forbidden concepts:

*   **Keywords**: Local/global balance, tight fit, bin consolidation, fragmentation avoidance, perfect fits, minimal waste.
*   **Advice**: Strategically combine immediate item placement with long-term container organization. Emphasize complete space utilization and prevent unusable voids.
*   **Avoid**: Creating small, unfillable gaps or leaving large, unproductive empty regions. Neglecting overall resource structure for minor, immediate gains.
*   **Explanation**: Effective heuristics must consider both the immediate fit and the global arrangement of resources to maximize efficiency and prevent future placement difficulties, ensuring comprehensive utility.
