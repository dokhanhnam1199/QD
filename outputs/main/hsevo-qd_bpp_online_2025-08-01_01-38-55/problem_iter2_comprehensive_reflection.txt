*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Scoring, Multi-Objective, Granular Incentives, Contextual Exploitation.
*   **Advice:** Implement **adaptive, multi-objective scoring** sensitive to problem state. Employ **non-linear reward functions** to strongly incentivize critical, high-value outcomes (e.g., perfect fits). **Exploit problem-specific structures** for informed greedy decisions.
*   **Avoid:** Static, rigid scoring; generic rule application; ignoring dynamic solution evolution.
*   **Explanation:** This fosters robust heuristics by enabling dynamic adaptation, precise steering towards complex goals via differentiated rewards, and intelligent, problem-aware decision-making, optimizing resource utilization.
