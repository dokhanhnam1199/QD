**Analysis:**
Comparing (Heuristics 1st) vs (Heuristics 2nd), Heuristics 1st, which applies a fixed small bonus (0.01) for consolidation by identifying partially filled bins (those with remaining capacity less than the maximum current capacity among fitting bins), slightly outperforms Heuristics 2nd. Heuristics 2nd uses a continuously tunable weighted sum of Best-Fit (`remaining_capacity_after_fit`) and `current_fullness` (current remaining capacity), with specific tuned weights (`-4.72...`, `-1.0`). Both successfully integrate a consolidation bias, but the simple, hard-coded conditional bonus in 1st proved marginally more effective in this ranking than 2nd's continuously weighted sum, even with its tuned parameters.

Comparing (Heuristics 2nd) vs (Heuristics 3rd), Heuristics 2nd (tuned weighted sum including bin fullness) is superior to Heuristics 3rd (tuned pure Best-Fit). Heuristics 3rd's `fit_score_weight` of `-5.04...` indicates it's a strongly tuned Best-Fit. However, the explicit inclusion of the `current_fullness_weight` component in Heuristics 2nd, favoring bins that are already fuller, demonstrates that a multi-objective scoring combining tight fit with bin consolidation (filling existing bins) provides better performance than a purely Best-Fit approach, even when both are highly tuned.

Comparing (Heuristics 3rd) vs (Heuristics 8th), Heuristics 3rd (tuned pure Best-Fit) significantly outperforms Heuristics 8th, which is also a pure Best-Fit but with a generic `fit_score_weight` of `-1.0`. This stark difference highlights the immense value of hyperparameter tuning: even a simple heuristic can become very powerful when its parameters are meticulously optimized for the problem instance.

Comparing (Heuristics 4th) vs (Heuristics 5th), both are "tunable" with default parameters. Heuristics 4th implements a Best-Fit with a *binary* consolidation bonus based on whether a bin is "partially filled" relative to the maximum capacity. Heuristics 5th employs a *continuous* weighted sum of "tight fit" and "bin fullness." Heuristics 5th (continuous weighting) outranks Heuristics 4th (binary bonus with similar defaults), suggesting that a continuous scoring for fullness is generally more robust or effective than a binary bonus when parameters are not specifically tuned.

Comparing (Heuristics 5th) vs (Heuristics 7th), Heuristics 5th (tunable weighted sum, default weights) performs better than Heuristics 7th, which uses a non-linear scoring function with a significant bonus for perfect fits and an inverse relationship for other tight fits. This indicates that while the *idea* of strongly prioritizing perfect fits and non-linear rewards might seem beneficial, the specific implementation in Heuristics 7th might lead to sub-optimal choices globally, perhaps by overly favoring very rare perfect fits or by creating less versatile remaining spaces compared to a more balanced linear combination.

Comparing (Heuristics 11th) vs (Heuristics 13th), Heuristics 11th, a highly complex "hybrid adaptive" heuristic that attempts to manage fragmentation by penalizing small remainders and rewarding large ones, is still vastly superior to Heuristics 13th. Heuristics 13th simply assigns zero priority to all bins, effectively leading to arbitrary or random bin selection among fitting bins. This confirms that any structured heuristic, no matter how poorly optimized or overly complex, offers more strategic guidance than a complete lack of strategy. The repeated instances of Heuristics 11th (11th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 19th, 20th) at the bottom ranks (excluding the dummy zero function) suggest its complex logic with its default parameters is often counter-productive, possibly opening too many bins prematurely or leaving too much usable space unused to avoid "fragmentation," thereby increasing the overall bin count.

Overall: The best-performing heuristics are those that combine the core "Best-Fit" principle with a mechanism for "consolidation" or "bin fullness." Crucially, even simple heuristics can achieve top performance if their parameters are meticulously tuned. Overly complex or non-linear scoring functions, while conceptually appealing, can underperform if not perfectly calibrated, sometimes leading to worse results than simpler, robust approaches.

**Experience:**
Prioritize problem-specific tuning over generic complexity. A simple heuristic with optimized parameters often outperforms an over-engineered one. Consistently incorporate a consolidation bias (favoring existing, fuller bins) alongside tight-fit criteria. Avoid excessive conditional logic unless rigorously validated, as it can inadvertently lead to sub-optimal global outcomes.
