**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the simpler linear Best-Fit (Heuristic 1) outperforms the more complex non-linear approach with perfect fit bonus (Heuristic 2). This suggests that while perfect fits are intuitively desirable and can reduce fragmentation, an overly aggressive non-linear weighting or bonus might not lead to globally optimal solutions for the specific problem instances tested. This could be due to the bonus causing an item to be placed in a bin for a perfect fit, even if that bin could have held a larger future item, leading to worse overall packing.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), Heuristic 2 (non-linear with bonus) is better than Heuristic 3 (parameterized linear Best-Fit). This indicates that the specific hardcoded parameters in Heuristic 3 (`default_low_priority`, `fit_score_weight`) likely lead to suboptimal behavior for the problem at hand, or that the non-linear weighting of Heuristic 2, despite being less effective than Heuristic 1, is still more robust than a poorly tuned linear model. The `fit_score_weight` of -4.72 likely amplifies the best-fit preference more aggressively than necessary.

Comparing the "Best-Fit" variants (1st, 2nd, 3rd) vs the "Worst" (11th-20th), it's evident that any attempt to prioritize bins based on a "best fit" criterion, even if the specific scoring function is not perfectly optimal (as in 2nd and 3rd), provides significantly better results than a heuristic that assigns uniform priority to all bins (Heuristics 11-20). The latter simply returns zero priorities, effectively making the choice arbitrary among valid bins, demonstrating a complete lack of strategic intelligence.

Overall: The ranking implies that a straightforward, well-understood heuristic like simple linear Best-Fit can be highly effective and robust. Introducing complexity (non-linear scoring, perfect-fit bonuses) or untuned parameters can unexpectedly degrade performance, potentially due to over-specialization, sub-optimal trade-offs, or an inability to generalize across problem instances.

**Experience:**
Simplicity and robustness often outperform over-engineered or poorly-tuned complexity. Explicitly rewarding perfect sub-solutions can be detrimental if it sacrifices overall optimality by limiting future options. Parameterization is powerful but demands rigorous, problem-specific tuning; sensible defaults are often superior to arbitrary 'magic numbers'. Always prefer a heuristic with domain intelligence over a random or null strategy.
