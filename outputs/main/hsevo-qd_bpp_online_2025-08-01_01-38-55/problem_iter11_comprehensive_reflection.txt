Here's a redefined self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Control, Singular Focus, Contextual Strategy, Integrated Design.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize identifying dynamic control points for adaptive behavior. Focus heuristics on a singular, primary objective to avoid diluted efforts. Implement context-aware decision processes instead of fixed rules. Ensure all components are synergistically integrated for holistic performance.
*   **Avoid:** Prescribing fixed algorithms (e.g., Best-Fit), hardcoding specific scoring functions, or overly incentivizing local optima that hinder global solutions. Do not rely on static, pre-defined decision rules.
*   **Explanation:** This fosters robust, adaptable heuristics that dynamically respond to problem specifics, avoiding brittle, pre-conceived notions of "best" strategies or scoring, thus promoting true global optimization.
