Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The core logic is identical, but (1st) uses different, seemingly better-tuned parameter values for `default_low_priority` and `fit_score_weight`. This highlights that for a given heuristic principle, the **meticulous tuning of its hyper-parameters is critical** for performance. Comparing (2nd) vs (8th), (3rd) vs (4th), and (5th) vs (9th), identical code snippets are ranked differently. This suggests either external, non-visible parameter tuning was performed, or the problem's solution space is highly sensitive to minute differences, causing very similar heuristics to rank slightly apart.\n\nComparing (1st) (Best-Fit with tunable weight) vs (10th) (fixed Best-Fit), the introduction of a **tunable `fit_score_weight`** in (1st) enables superior performance. This allows the heuristic to be calibrated for specific problem instances, demonstrating the value of flexible design.\n\nComparing (1st) (tuned Best-Fit) vs (2nd) (Best-Fit + Bin Fullness), the simpler, well-tuned pure Best-Fit (1st) outperforms the more complex multi-objective approach (2nd) with its default weights. This suggests that a **highly optimized, focused heuristic can be more effective than a broader, combined strategy** if the latter's components are not perfectly balanced.\n\nComparing (2nd) (Best-Fit + Bin Fullness) vs (3rd) (Best-Fit + Consolidation Bias), the explicit linear combination of \"tight fit\" and \"bin fullness\" in (2nd) performs better than (3rd)'s threshold-based \"consolidation bonus\". This indicates that **direct and continuous integration of secondary objectives through weighted sums** might be more robust than simple additive bonuses.\n\nComparing (6th) (Tunable Best-Fit + Tunable Consolidation Bias) vs (3rd/4th) (Fixed Best-Fit + Fixed Consolidation Bias), the tunable version (6th) ranks higher. This reinforces the importance of **tunability for all significant components** of a multi-faceted heuristic.\n\nFinally, observing the dramatic performance drop from (10th) (basic Best-Fit) to (11th-20th) (trivial \"return zeros\" / no strategy), it's clear that **any strategic placement heuristic significantly outperforms a non-strategic approach**. The core Best-Fit principle, which minimizes individual wasted space, serves as a strong foundation.\n- \nHere's a redefined self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Control, Singular Focus, Contextual Strategy, Integrated Design.\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize identifying dynamic control points for adaptive behavior. Focus heuristics on a singular, primary objective to avoid diluted efforts. Implement context-aware decision processes instead of fixed rules. Ensure all components are synergistically integrated for holistic performance.\n*   **Avoid:** Prescribing fixed algorithms (e.g., Best-Fit), hardcoding specific scoring functions, or overly incentivizing local optima that hinder global solutions. Do not rely on static, pre-defined decision rules.\n*   **Explanation:** This fosters robust, adaptable heuristics that dynamically respond to problem specifics, avoiding brittle, pre-conceived notions of \"best\" strategies or scoring, thus promoting true global optimization.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
