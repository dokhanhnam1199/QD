{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDesign effective heuristics by balancing local (tight fit) with global objectives (bin consolidation, fragmentation avoidance). Prioritize perfect fits and penalize small unusable remainders. Tunable parameters are valuable for adaptability, but specific, well-optimized defaults can also excel. Avoid strategies that prioritize leaving large, underutilized spaces.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesigning better heuristics demands encoding precise objective functions into scoring. Best Fit is generally superior to First Fit. Crucially, consider non-linear scoring (e.g., inverse or exponential) to strongly incentivize specific, highly desirable outcomes like perfect fits, as this often leads to optimized resource utilization.\n\nSimplicity and robustness often outperform over-engineered or poorly-tuned complexity. Explicitly rewarding perfect sub-solutions can be detrimental if it sacrifices overall optimality by limiting future options. Parameterization is powerful but demands rigorous, problem-specific tuning; sensible defaults are often superior to arbitrary 'magic numbers'. Always prefer a heuristic with domain intelligence over a random or null strategy.\n\nPrioritize fundamental, effective strategies like Best-Fit. Crucially, externalize key scoring components as tunable parameters rather than fixed constants. Optimized parameters on simpler models often outperform complex, untuned heuristics. Always provide intelligent prioritization; trivial heuristics perform worst. Parameter tuning is paramount for competitive results.\n\nEffective heuristic design prioritizes **tunability of parameters** over fixed values. A **well-tuned, focused heuristic** can outperform more complex, multi-objective approaches. Any **intelligent decision-making strategy** will drastically improve upon arbitrary choices. Balance simplicity and effectiveness, and ensure components are continuously integrated rather than just bonus-based.\n\nPrioritize problem-specific tuning over generic complexity. A simple heuristic with optimized parameters often outperforms an over-engineered one. Consistently incorporate a consolidation bias (favoring existing, fuller bins) alongside tight-fit criteria. Avoid excessive conditional logic unless rigorously validated, as it can inadvertently lead to sub-optimal global outcomes.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
