*   **Keywords:** Adaptable Baselines, Parameterized Mechanisms, Contextual Tuning, Robust Simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Develop adaptable heuristic baselines. Externalize *mechanism weights* for tuning. Prioritize context-aware logic. Rigorous, problem-specific tuning on simpler models is key.
*   **Avoid:** Fixed, overly precise scoring functions. Arbitrary "magic number" parameters. Explicitly rewarding perfect sub-solutions if detrimental to global optimality. Over-engineered complexity.
*   **Explanation:** Design foundational, tunable heuristics focusing on adaptable logic and empirical validation, avoiding rigid definitions or local optima from premature sub-component incentives.
