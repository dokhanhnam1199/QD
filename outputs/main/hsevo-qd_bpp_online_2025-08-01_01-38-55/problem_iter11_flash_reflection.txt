**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (7th), both implement a Best-Fit heuristic with a weighted remaining capacity. The core logic is identical, but (1st) uses different, seemingly better-tuned parameter values for `default_low_priority` and `fit_score_weight`. This highlights that for a given heuristic principle, the **meticulous tuning of its hyper-parameters is critical** for performance. Comparing (2nd) vs (8th), (3rd) vs (4th), and (5th) vs (9th), identical code snippets are ranked differently. This suggests either external, non-visible parameter tuning was performed, or the problem's solution space is highly sensitive to minute differences, causing very similar heuristics to rank slightly apart.

Comparing (1st) (Best-Fit with tunable weight) vs (10th) (fixed Best-Fit), the introduction of a **tunable `fit_score_weight`** in (1st) enables superior performance. This allows the heuristic to be calibrated for specific problem instances, demonstrating the value of flexible design.

Comparing (1st) (tuned Best-Fit) vs (2nd) (Best-Fit + Bin Fullness), the simpler, well-tuned pure Best-Fit (1st) outperforms the more complex multi-objective approach (2nd) with its default weights. This suggests that a **highly optimized, focused heuristic can be more effective than a broader, combined strategy** if the latter's components are not perfectly balanced.

Comparing (2nd) (Best-Fit + Bin Fullness) vs (3rd) (Best-Fit + Consolidation Bias), the explicit linear combination of "tight fit" and "bin fullness" in (2nd) performs better than (3rd)'s threshold-based "consolidation bonus". This indicates that **direct and continuous integration of secondary objectives through weighted sums** might be more robust than simple additive bonuses.

Comparing (6th) (Tunable Best-Fit + Tunable Consolidation Bias) vs (3rd/4th) (Fixed Best-Fit + Fixed Consolidation Bias), the tunable version (6th) ranks higher. This reinforces the importance of **tunability for all significant components** of a multi-faceted heuristic.

Finally, observing the dramatic performance drop from (10th) (basic Best-Fit) to (11th-20th) (trivial "return zeros" / no strategy), it's clear that **any strategic placement heuristic significantly outperforms a non-strategic approach**. The core Best-Fit principle, which minimizes individual wasted space, serves as a strong foundation.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristic design prioritizes **tunability of parameters** over fixed values. A **well-tuned, focused heuristic** can outperform more complex, multi-objective approaches. Any **intelligent decision-making strategy** will drastically improve upon arbitrary choices. Balance simplicity and effectiveness, and ensure components are continuously integrated rather than just bonus-based.
