*   **Keywords**: Simplicity, Robustness, Global Flexibility, Domain Intelligence.
*   **Advice**: Favor simple, resilient designs over intricate ones. Prioritize overall solution quality, not just perfect sub-solutions that limit future options. Parameterization must be context-driven, not arbitrary. Always infuse problem-specific insights.
*   **Avoid**: Prescribing specific scoring methodologies, comparing particular algorithms (e.g., Best Fit vs. First Fit), or incentivizing specific outcomes with complex non-linear scoring.
*   **Explanation**: This promotes heuristics that are adaptable, less prone to over-fitting, and maintain a broad solution space, preventing premature commitment to local optima through rigid, component-level scoring.
