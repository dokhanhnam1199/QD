**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe a crucial difference in how "tightness of fit" is translated into a priority score. Heuristic 1st employs an inverse relationship (`1.0 / (residual_space + epsilon)`), causing priority to skyrocket as residual space approaches zero. This non-linear scaling gives a disproportionately high preference to perfect or near-perfect fits, aggressively pushing for bin completion. In contrast, Heuristic 2nd (and 3rd-8th, 10th) uses a linear negative relationship (`-residual_capacity` or `-slack`). While still implementing "Best Fit" by favoring smaller residuals, the priority difference between a near-perfect fit (e.g., 0.01 residual) and a slightly larger one (e.g., 0.1 residual) is much smaller in the linear scheme, making it less aggressive in seeking out extremely tight configurations. This explains why the inverse weighting (1st and 9th) is ranked higher.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), and similarly (5th) vs (6th), and (7th) vs (8th): these pairs are identical in their implementation logic. Their ranking suggests that minor variations in docstring descriptions or variable naming do not impact performance if the core heuristic calculation remains the same. This reinforces that the *mathematical formulation* of the priority function is paramount.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), and consistently across (11th-20th): Heuristic 10th still attempts a "Best Fit" by minimizing residual space. However, Heuristics 11th through 20th are all identical and severely flawed; they simply return `np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)`. This effectively means all bins that can fit the item have an equal, non-discriminating priority. When `np.argmax` is applied, it will consistently pick the bin with the lowest index that can accommodate the item, which is essentially a "First Fit" strategy among eligible bins. This lack of any intelligent prioritization based on the item's size relative to available space explains their consistently low ranking.

Overall: The ranking reveals a clear hierarchy of effectiveness. Strategies that strongly prioritize precise fits (like 1st/9th with inverse weighting) are superior. Standard "Best Fit" strategies (like 2nd-8th, 10th, using negative residuals) are good but less aggressive. The worst heuristics are those that provide no meaningful prioritization, defaulting to a "First Fit" or arbitrary choice.

**Experience:**
Designing better heuristics demands encoding precise objective functions into scoring. Best Fit is generally superior to First Fit. Crucially, consider non-linear scoring (e.g., inverse or exponential) to strongly incentivize specific, highly desirable outcomes like perfect fits, as this often leads to optimized resource utilization.
