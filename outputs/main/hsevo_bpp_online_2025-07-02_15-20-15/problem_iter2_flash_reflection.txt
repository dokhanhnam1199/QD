**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the 1st uses fill ratio after placing the item and a bonus for partially filled bins, while the 11th minimizes waste, encourages filling bins, avoids almost full bins, boosts bins with similar remaining capacity, and considers remaining capacity as a tie-breaker. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd prioritizes based on wasted space and fill ratio if the item is added with division by zero protection, while the 4th gives high priority to bins that can fit, adjusts priorities based on remaining capacity ratio, and bonuses almost full bins. Comparing (second best) vs (second worst), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the first uses fill ratio after placing item while the 3rd uses wasted space.
Overall: The better heuristics utilize a fill-ratio based approach calculated *after* placing the item, combined with bonuses for already-partially-filled bins to avoid starting new bins. They also include a tie-breaker based on minimizing remaining capacity. The worse heuristics either overly penalize infeasible bins or combine too many different factors without clear weighting. Some heuristics also fail to normalize or scale certain components appropriately. Also, remember to consider edge cases (e.g. division by zero).

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize a few key factors like fill ratio and minimizing wasted space *after* placement. Add small bonuses for desirable states and penalties for undesirable ones. Scale and normalize appropriately, and always handle edge cases to avoid unexpected behavior. Avoid overly complex combinations of factors without clear rationale.
