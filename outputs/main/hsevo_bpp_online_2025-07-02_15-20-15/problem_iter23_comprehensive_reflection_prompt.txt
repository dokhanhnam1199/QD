{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a combination of multiple factors (tight-fit, fill ratio, remaining capacity). Use carefully tuned weights to balance these factors. Normalize input values to a common range. Incorporate controlled exploration with small random noise. Handle edge cases like infeasible solutions and division by zero gracefully.\nWhen designing bin-packing heuristics, prioritize tight fits and strategies for opening new bins. Experiment with reciprocal remaining capacity. Handle infeasibility gracefully using clear negative priorities. Fine-tune the balance between fill ratio, remaining capacity, and bonuses for nearly-full bins. Normalizing the remaining capacity may improve performance.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a few key factors like fill ratio and minimizing wasted space *after* placement. Add small bonuses for desirable states and penalties for undesirable ones. Scale and normalize appropriately, and always handle edge cases to avoid unexpected behavior. Avoid overly complex combinations of factors without clear rationale.\n\nFavor tighter fits with exponential decay of remaining capacity. Use -np.inf for infeasible bins. Simpler combinations of factors for the priority calculation lead to better performance. Avoid adding too many bonuses or penalties as these can complicate the heuristic.\n\nPrioritize normalization when using exponential decay. Consider incorporating fill ratio as a multiplier. Introduce a small bonus for \"nearly full\" bins. Properly handle edge cases, especially when no feasible bins exist, to encourage exploration of new bins.\n\nPrioritize complete solutions: Consider fill ratio, remaining capacity, and \"nearly full\" states. Use exponential decay for nuanced prioritization. Address edge cases (e.g., no feasible bins) with appropriate fallback strategies. Carefully weigh different factors for optimal performance.\n\nWhen designing bin packing heuristics, consider a weighted combination of tightness of fit, fill ratio, and existing bin utilization. Introduce controlled randomness for exploration, especially when no feasible bins are available. Normalizing priority scores is useful to prevent domination by one factor.\n\nSimplicity and balance between tight-fit and fill ratio are key to good heuristic design. Avoid overcomplicated conditional logic and focus on refining the core components. Exploration should be carefully introduced and controlled. The weights of tight-fit and fill ratio is important, should be tuned.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
