**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a simple combination of tight-fit and fill ratio, while the worst attempts to add a conditional empty bin bonus during exploration, which may overcomplicate the priority calculation. Also the exploration probability may increase the calculation complexity and cause worse performance.
(2nd best) vs (2nd worst): The second-best emphasizes a straightforward combination of tight fit and fill ratio while penalizing infeasible bins, whereas the second worst focuses on just tight fits, fill ratio, and exploration with noise, which might be insufficient to ensure efficient bin usage.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical.
(3rd) vs (4th): The heuristics are identical.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the exploration component in the worst heuristic may not be as effective as the simple combination of tight-fit and fill ratio in the second worst. Overall: The better heuristics emphasize a balanced combination of tight-fit and fill ratio with simpler exploration strategies, while the worse ones introduce more complex conditional logic and exploration which may not be effective and can be detrimental to performance. Better heuristics consistently prioritize simplicity and balance. Weights also appear to matter.

**Experience:**
Simplicity and balance between tight-fit and fill ratio are key to good heuristic design. Avoid overcomplicated conditional logic and focus on refining the core components. Exploration should be carefully introduced and controlled. The weights of tight-fit and fill ratio is important, should be tuned.
