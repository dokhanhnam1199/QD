Okay, here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, optimized for creating better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Deliberate experimentation, performance metrics, iterative refinement, sensitivity analysis.
*   **Advice:** Focus on measurable impact. Track *why* design choices improve/degrade performance using relevant metrics. Prioritize rigorous A/B testing of different priority functions.
*   **Avoid:** Intuition-based tuning without validation, ad-hoc bonuses/penalties, premature optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Shift from vague "prioritize" statements to a data-driven approach. Explicitly measure and compare heuristic performance using relevant metrics. Analyze *why* specific changes work, enabling more informed decisions.
