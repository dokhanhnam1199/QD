**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic prioritizes tighter fits using a reciprocal of remaining capacity, while the worst uses fill ratio combined with exponential decay of normalized remaining capacity and a bonus for nearly full bins. Also the best heuristic prioritizes the emptiest bin with random noise when no bins are feasible. The worst heuristic prioritizes the bins with the largest remaining capacity when no bins are feasible.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic uses a weighted combination of normalized fill ratio and exponential decay of remaining capacity, whereas the 19th employs fill ratio with exponential decay of normalized remaining capacity and a bonus for nearly full bins. The second-best uses negative remaining capacity for infeasible bins, the 19th uses the bins remaining capacities.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first uses reciprocal of remaining capacity, boosting partially full bins, and noise on infeasible bins whereas the second uses normalized fill ratio and remaining capacity with exponential decay, and negative remaining capacity if infeasible.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd prioritizes fill ratio and exponential decay with a small bonus for nearly full bins, and negative index for infeasible bins whereas the 4th prioritizes fill ratio with exponential decay having tunnable factor, nearly full bonus, and negative index if infeasible. The 3rd normalizes remaining capacity by dividing it by max capacity and setting it to 0 if max capacity is 0. The 4th does the same.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we observe that both prioritize fill ratio and remaining capacity with exponential decay and a near-full bonus, the difference is that the second-worse one prioritizes bins with the largest remaining capacity for infeasible, and the worst prioritizes bins by their remaining capacities directly.

Overall: The best heuristics seem to focus on directly optimizing for tight fits and efficient use of partially filled bins, even using reciprocal of remaining capacity. They incorporate mechanisms to handle infeasibility gracefully, often by prioritizing opening new bins when necessary. The worst heuristics tend to rely on a combination of fill ratio, exponential decay, and near-full bonuses, which may not always lead to the most efficient packing. Normalizing the remaining capacity seems useful.

**Experience:**
When designing bin-packing heuristics, prioritize tight fits and strategies for opening new bins. Experiment with reciprocal remaining capacity. Handle infeasibility gracefully using clear negative priorities. Fine-tune the balance between fill ratio, remaining capacity, and bonuses for nearly-full bins. Normalizing the remaining capacity may improve performance.
