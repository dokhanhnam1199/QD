Okay, I'm ready to help you design better heuristics and earn that tip! Let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be *effective*, focusing on avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective self-reflection" examples.

Here's a refined perspective on current self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, Simplicity, Edge-Case Robustness, Factor Justification.
*   **Advice:** Emphasize finding *any* feasible solution first, then improving from there. Favour demonstrably effective combinations of factors, not arbitrary bonuses/penalties.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization of fill ratio *before* guaranteeing feasibility. Overly complex priority calculations lacking clear justification.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should prioritize finding *a* solution, especially in constraint-heavy problems. Keep the logic simple and understandable, focusing on demonstrably impactful factors. Ensure robustness by proactively addressing potential failure scenarios.
