{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize normalization when using exponential decay. Consider incorporating fill ratio as a multiplier. Introduce a small bonus for \"nearly full\" bins. Properly handle edge cases, especially when no feasible bins exist, to encourage exploration of new bins.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a few key factors like fill ratio and minimizing wasted space *after* placement. Add small bonuses for desirable states and penalties for undesirable ones. Scale and normalize appropriately, and always handle edge cases to avoid unexpected behavior. Avoid overly complex combinations of factors without clear rationale.\n\nFavor tighter fits with exponential decay of remaining capacity. Use -np.inf for infeasible bins. Simpler combinations of factors for the priority calculation lead to better performance. Avoid adding too many bonuses or penalties as these can complicate the heuristic.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
