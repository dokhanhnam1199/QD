**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic normalizes remaining capacity in the exponential decay calculation using `np.max(bins_remain_cap)`, while the worst directly uses `bins_remain_cap`. The best heuristic also multiplies the exponential decay by the `fill_ratio`, whereas the worst only uses the exponential decay. The best also handles the edge case where no bins are feasible by assigning negative priorities. The worst fills the entire `priorities` array with `-np.inf` if no valid bins exist.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the second-best heuristic includes a bonus for bins that are nearly full, and uses exponential decay without multiplying with the `fill_ratio`, while the third-best does not explicitly include a bonus for nearly full bins but multiplies exponential decay by the `fill_ratio`. The second-best heuristic's exponent is dependent on `np.max(bins_remain_cap)` to normalize remaining capacity, while the third-best does.

Comparing (1st) vs (4th), the first multiplies the exponential decay by the `fill_ratio`, whereas the fourth does not. Also, the first one only adds negative priorities if `feasible` is false, the second always does.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), no differences exist between the two heuristics.

Overall: The better heuristics normalize the remaining capacity to the max capacity when calculating the exponential decay. Multiplying the exponential decay with `fill_ratio` seems to improve results. Adding a bonus to nearly full bins has a slightly positive impact. Properly handling edge cases where no bins are feasible (assigning negative values based on the bin index) is also important.

**Experience:**
Prioritize normalization when using exponential decay. Consider incorporating fill ratio as a multiplier. Introduce a small bonus for "nearly full" bins. Properly handle edge cases, especially when no feasible bins exist, to encourage exploration of new bins.
