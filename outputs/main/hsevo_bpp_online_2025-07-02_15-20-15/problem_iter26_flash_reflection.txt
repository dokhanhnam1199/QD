**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic uses more sophisticated tight-fit and capacity penalty calculations, along with tuned weights, whereas the 20th focuses on a simpler normalized capacity and fill ratio. (2nd) vs (19th) are almost identical with small number. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) the 3rd function is same as the first and second, the 4th function use exponential decay for tight fit and square for higher fill ratios. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see heuristic 11th has better values 0.7 and 0.3 for fit_priority and fill_ratio than the last one (normalized_capacity + fill_ratio * 0.5). Overall: The better heuristics include a combination of tight fit, fill ratio, and capacity awareness, often with tuned weights or normalization. They also incorporate exploration, but less aggressively when no feasible bin exists. They avoid overly simplistic calculations and seem to benefit from fine-tuning of weight parameters.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors like tight fit, fill ratio, and capacity. Normalize values where appropriate. Experiment with different weighting schemes and small exploration factors. Don't over-simplify the logic, and consider the case where no feasible solution exists.
