Okay, here's a refined view of self-reflection for designing better bin-packing heuristics, focusing on actionable improvements and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Core logic, controlled exploration, tunable weights, graceful infeasibility.
*   **Advice:** Focus on simple, well-defined priority calculations. Experiment with normalization and reciprocal remaining capacity *early* in the design process. Explicitly handle edge cases related to infeasibility.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex conditional logic, excessive bonuses/penalties without justification, premature optimization of secondary factors.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize clear, tunable core logic. Controlled exploration is essential, not an afterthought. Tune weights systematically, not randomly. Infeasibility handling should be part of the *initial* design.

This approach emphasizes a simpler, more structured, and testable heuristic development process.
