**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first calculates fill ratio using `item / bins_remain_cap[feasible]` while the last computes it as `(bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item) / bins_remain_cap[feasible]`. The first prioritizes bins based on how full they would become *if* the item was added while the last focus on the proportion of used space *before* adding item. Also, the first utilizes an exponential decay function based on the normalized remaining capacity and adds a bonus for nearly full bins, while the last only considers normalized remaining capacity and fill ratio, with a linear combination.
(2nd) vs (19th), these are quite similar except for the "nearly full" bonus of the 2nd and how fill_ratio is computed. 2nd one computes `item / bins_remain_cap[feasible]` vs `(bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item) / bins_remain_cap[feasible]` of the 19th.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the difference lies in the bonus for nearly full bins (0.2 vs 0.25) and a slightly different phrasing in docstring. These are negligibly different.
(3rd) vs (4th), the third version calculates fill ratio as `item / bins_remain_cap[feasible]`, while the fourth calculates as `(bins_remain_cap[feasible] - remaining_capacity_after_placement) / bins_remain_cap[feasible]`. The third calculates `normalized_remaining_capacity` and directly multiplies the exponential decay, whereas the fourth combines normalized fill ratio and exponential decay with weights (0.7 and 0.3 respectively). Also 4th has fallback in case no bins feasible.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see significant overlaps with one another.
Overall: The better heuristics utilize exponential decay based on normalized remaining capacity, often combined with the fill ratio, and provide bonuses for nearly full bins. Some heuristics handle the edge case where no bins are feasible by prioritizing bins with the smallest remaining capacity or using bin index. The less effective heuristics tend to use simpler linear combinations or lack specific bonus mechanisms for nearly full bins.

**Experience:**
Prioritize complete solutions: Consider fill ratio, remaining capacity, and "nearly full" states. Use exponential decay for nuanced prioritization. Address edge cases (e.g., no feasible bins) with appropriate fallback strategies. Carefully weigh different factors for optimal performance.
