Okay, let's redefine self-reflection for better heuristic design, focusing on avoiding pitfalls and emphasizing effective strategies.

*   **Keywords:** Multi-criteria, normalization, infeasibility handling, controlled exploration, adaptive weighting.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering *multiple* normalized factors like fit, fill, and capacity. Implement controlled, *adaptive* exploration strategies instead of static randomness.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex logic *without justification*. Fixating on post-placement metrics, and numerous static bonuses/penalties.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance diverse factors with adaptable weights. Normalization prevents domination. Graceful infeasibility handling and controlled exploration enhances robustness. Avoid over-engineering without clear benefits.
