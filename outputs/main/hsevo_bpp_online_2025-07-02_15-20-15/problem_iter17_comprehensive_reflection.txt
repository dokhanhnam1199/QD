Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into something more actionable for designing better bin packing heuristics, while avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." We'll focus on clarity, concrete suggestions, and avoiding complexity without justification.

Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Tight-fit, controlled randomness, normalization, infeasibility handling, reciprocal capacity, balanced factors, exploration

*   **Advice:** Start with a small, well-defined set of priority factors (e.g., tightness of fit, fill ratio) and *systematically* introduce complexity if needed. Experiment with reciprocal remaining capacity instead of exponential decay. Use controlled randomness (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to explore new bin openings.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex combinations of factors without a clear, testable hypothesis. Relying solely on bonuses/penalties without a solid baseline heuristic. Prematurely normalizing all priority scores, especially without understanding individual factor distributions.

*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create interpretable heuristics. Track the impact of each added factor. Focus on a reciprocal remaining capacity to emphasize tight fits while avoiding the potential for exponential decay to overly prioritize certain bins. Handle infeasibility explicitly and with minimal impact on other parts of heuristic.
