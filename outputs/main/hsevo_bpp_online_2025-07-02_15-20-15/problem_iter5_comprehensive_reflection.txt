Okay, let's refine the concept of "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, specifically avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection". We aim for concise, impactful insights.

Here's a refined definition:

*   **Keywords:** Parsimony, core factors, feasibility, decay.
*   **Advice:** Focus on fundamental drivers (e.g., fill ratio with exponential capacity decay penalty). Prioritize feasibility; immediately invalidate infeasible moves.
*   **Avoid:** Over-engineered scoring functions, gratuitous bonuses/penalties.
*   **Explanation:** Emphasize simple, interpretable combinations of *essential* factors. Use exponential decay of remaining capacity. Explicitly model feasibility constraints, and handle them strictly.
