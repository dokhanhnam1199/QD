Okay, I'm ready to help you redefine 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics! Let's aim for a more effective and insightful approach.

Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' focusing on actionable improvements:

*   **Keywords:** Goal-oriented, iterative, adaptable, trade-offs, evaluation metrics, systematic exploration, assumptions, validation.
*   **Advice:** Define clear, measurable goals *before* designing. Iteratively test and refine heuristics based on performance data. Document assumptions and limitations. Actively explore diverse heuristic structures.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, rigid adherence to initial designs, neglecting edge cases, relying solely on intuition without validation.
*   **Explanation:** Emphasize a goal-driven, iterative design process with systematic exploration of different heuristic structures. Avoid getting stuck in initial designs by continuously validating and adapting based on concrete performance metrics. Consider and document the limitations in advance.
