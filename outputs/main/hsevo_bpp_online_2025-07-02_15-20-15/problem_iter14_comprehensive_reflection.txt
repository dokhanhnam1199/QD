Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better bin-packing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection." Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, Bin Initialization, Remaining Capacity, Priority Function, Edge Cases, Normalization, Exploration.

*   **Advice:** Rigorously test priority functions on varied datasets. Emphasize graceful infeasibility handling to encourage exploration, and efficient bin initialization strategies.

*   **Avoid:** Unjustified complexity in priority calculations. Premature scaling without experimentation. Over-reliance on bonuses without clear understanding of their impact. Blindly normalizing without empirical justification.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on designing priority functions based on sound mathematical principles and extensive experimentation. Understand the interplay between feasibility constraints, exploration mechanisms, and the overall heuristic's performance.
