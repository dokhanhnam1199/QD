Okay, I understand the task. Let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective in designing heuristics, based on avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, Exploration, Normalization, Simplicity, Edge Cases.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize exploring *feasible* solutions. Focus on normalizing key factors (e.g., fill ratio, remaining capacity) before combining them. Explicitly design for edge cases (no feasible bins).
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex formulas, adding bonuses/penalties without strong justification.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should focus on creating *feasible* assignments. Simpler, normalized factor combinations help maintain control and avoid unintended consequences. Edge case handling ensures robustness.
