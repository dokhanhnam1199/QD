**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic prioritizes tight fits using the reciprocal of remaining capacity after placement, incorporates a fill ratio component, and adds a small constant to prevent division by zero. It uses `+ fill_ratio * 0.1` to add a fill ratio, while the worst only considers the inverse of remaining capacity and adds a fill ratio boost. The best also adds a small random component when no bin is feasible, using `np.random.rand(len(bins_remain_cap)) * 0.0001` to encourage exploration, whereas the worst prioritizes emptiest bin with noise. The best heuristics use `priorities = bins_remain_cap + np.random.rand(len(bins_remain_cap)) * 0.0001` if no bin is feasible.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see the second best prioritizes bins based on reciprocal remaining capacity and noise for infeasible bins. Boost partially full bins using `partially_full = (waste > 0) & (waste < 0.2 * bins_remain_cap[feasible])` and `priorities[feasible][partially_full] += 0.5`, with a noise for infeasible bins `priorities[infeasible] = -np.random.rand(np.sum(infeasible))`. The second worst heuristic also prioritizes based on reciprocal remaining capacity but boost partially full bins with noise (exploration) with condition `partially_full = (waste > 0) & (waste < 0.2 * bins_remain_cap[feasible])`. In the else case, the second worst heuristic uses random exploration `priorities = np.random.rand(len(bins_remain_cap))` if all bins are infeasible.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are all the same.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are all the same.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst prioritizes the emptiest bin with noise if no feasible bin while the worst prioritize emptiest bin with noise if no feasible bins as well.

Overall:
The best heuristics seem to strike a balance between prioritizing tight fits (small remaining capacity), encouraging reasonable fill ratios, considering existing bin utilization, and incorporating an element of exploration (randomness) to escape local optima or handle cases where no feasible bins exist. Infeasible bins are consistently handled by assigning a very low priority (often -np.inf) or by using noise to ensure exploration. Weighting different factors (tightness of fit, fill ratio, bin utilization) appears to be a crucial element in differentiating the better heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing bin packing heuristics, consider a weighted combination of tightness of fit, fill ratio, and existing bin utilization. Introduce controlled randomness for exploration, especially when no feasible bins are available. Normalizing priority scores is useful to prevent domination by one factor.
