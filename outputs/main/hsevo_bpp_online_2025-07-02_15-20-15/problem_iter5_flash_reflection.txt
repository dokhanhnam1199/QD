**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses only exponential decay on remaining capacity while the worst introduces a waste threshold and combines exponential decay with a linear term for remaining space. The best gives -inf priority to infeasible bins while the worst gives -np.arange(len(bins_remain_cap)).
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic combines fill ratio with exponential decay and adds a bonus for bins close to full, while the second worst prioritizes utilization scores and fit scores, penalizing bins with too much remaining capacity.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best uses exponential decay while the second best uses `fill_ratio * np.exp()`. Also, the second best introduces small bonus for bins that are close to full after placement.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see these two are the same.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst uses same logic with the best while the worst introduces a waste threshold and combines exponential decay with a linear term for remaining space.

Overall:
The better heuristics prioritize a tighter fit, often using exponential decay on the remaining capacity, and handle infeasible bins by assigning a very low priority (-np.inf). They tend to avoid complex combinations of factors. Simplicity in the combination of factors seems to be favored.

**Experience:**
Favor tighter fits with exponential decay of remaining capacity. Use -np.inf for infeasible bins. Simpler combinations of factors for the priority calculation lead to better performance. Avoid adding too many bonuses or penalties as these can complicate the heuristic.
