{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nFavor tighter fits with exponential decay of remaining capacity. Use -np.inf for infeasible bins. Simpler combinations of factors for the priority calculation lead to better performance. Avoid adding too many bonuses or penalties as these can complicate the heuristic.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a few key factors like fill ratio and minimizing wasted space *after* placement. Add small bonuses for desirable states and penalties for undesirable ones. Scale and normalize appropriately, and always handle edge cases to avoid unexpected behavior. Avoid overly complex combinations of factors without clear rationale.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
