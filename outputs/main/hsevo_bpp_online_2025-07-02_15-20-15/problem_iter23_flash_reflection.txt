**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best functions use pre-defined and well-tuned weights and small numbers to ensure stability and good performance across a wide range of inputs. The fill ratio calculation differs subtly: the best version uses `(bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item) / remaining_capacity`, while other versions use `item / (bins_remain_cap[feasible] + 0.0001)` or `(item) / (bins_remain_cap[feasible] + 0.0001)`. The handling of infeasible bins appears similar, but the crucial difference lies in the tunable parameters and how the fill ratio is calculated.
*   Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we observe no difference. Both are identical, which is unexpected given the ranking. This suggests a potential issue with the ranking process.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are exactly the same.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see they are exactly the same.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are exactly the same.
*   Overall: The superior heuristics prioritize a combination of tight-fit and fill ratio, with carefully chosen weights and a small constant to avoid division by zero. Normalizing the remaining capacity seems beneficial. Exploration through random noise is present across many heuristics, suggesting its general usefulness, but the best versions likely tune the scale of this noise. The consistent use of `-np.inf` for infeasible bins is a good practice. More recent versions normalize remaining capacity and clip the fill ratio between \[0, 1].

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, prioritize a combination of multiple factors (tight-fit, fill ratio, remaining capacity). Use carefully tuned weights to balance these factors. Normalize input values to a common range. Incorporate controlled exploration with small random noise. Handle edge cases like infeasible solutions and division by zero gracefully.
