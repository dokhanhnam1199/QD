**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first one considers near fit, avoids fragmentation, and tries to completely fill bins, whereas the last one simply calculates the negative log of the ratio between item size and remaining bin capacity. (second best) vs (second worst) are the same, there is no difference between them. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are exactly the same, no difference. (3rd) vs (4th) also the same, nothing changed. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the functions from 11th to 20th use only `ratios = item / bins_remain_cap; log_ratios = np.log(ratios); priorities = -log_ratios` while the others consider multiple factors and are much more complex. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors, including near fit, fragmentation avoidance, and complete filling, while the worse ones rely on a single, simple calculation.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and combine them thoughtfully. Avoid overly simplistic approaches that may neglect important aspects of the problem. Fine-tune the weights and thresholds of different factors based on experimentation and domain knowledge.
