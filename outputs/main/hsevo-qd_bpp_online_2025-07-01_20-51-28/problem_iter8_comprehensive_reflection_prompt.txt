{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize a multifaceted approach combining near-fit, fragmentation avoidance, complete fill, and fill level considerations. Dynamic weighting of these factors based on the specific item and bin states leads to better performance. Named arguments with optimized default values for all parameters affecting scoring is a good strategy.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and combine them thoughtfully. Avoid overly simplistic approaches that may neglect important aspects of the problem. Fine-tune the weights and thresholds of different factors based on experimentation and domain knowledge.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for packing problems, consider combining multiple relevant factors with weighted bonuses and penalties. Prioritize heuristics that address common issues like fragmentation and incomplete filling. Handle edge cases explicitly and dynamically adjust weights based on the current state.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
