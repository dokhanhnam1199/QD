Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on effectiveness:

*   **Keywords:** Holistic analysis, adaptive weighting, empirical validation, iterative refinement.
*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze problem components, dynamically adjust factor influence, and rigorously test outcomes.
*   **Avoid:** Fixating on initial assumptions, neglecting data-driven adjustments, and premature convergence.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static, intuitive heuristics towards dynamically refined approaches grounded in empirical observation and continuous adaptation.
