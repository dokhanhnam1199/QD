Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd) vs (19th) shows a similar contrast. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the inclusion of capacity ratio weighting and its effect. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals the impact of handling bins that can't contain items and marking all possible bins minimally acceptable. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we observe no functional difference. Comparing (16th) vs (20th), again no change. Comparing (7th) vs (8th), there's a shift to using named arguments with preset default values, which are optimized, for all parameters affecting scoring. (13th) vs (16th), using dynamic bonus. Overall: The better heuristics use a combination of different strategies.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to drive better heuristic design.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, state-dependent, multifaceted scoring, constraint balancing, dynamic prioritization, implicit constraints.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt factor weights based on current bin and item states. Model implicit constraints and balances different potentially conflicting objectives.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static weights, rigid factor combinations, ignoring state information, and a single-objective focus.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond fixed approaches. Create heuristics that intelligently react to the specific packing situation, balancing factors and addressing implicit constraints dynamically.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
