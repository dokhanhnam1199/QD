Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines near-fit, fragmentation avoidance, capacity ratio, with handling for full bins and dynamic adjustments.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    near_fit_threshold = 0.9\n    near_fit_bonus = 10.0\n    small_fragment_threshold = 0.1\n    large_fragment_penalty = -5.0\n    complete_fill_bonus = 20.0\n    capacity_ratio_weight = 2.0\n\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return priorities\n    \n    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    avg_bin_capacity = np.mean(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins])\n\n    for i, remaining_cap in enumerate(bins_remain_cap):\n        if remaining_cap < item:\n            priorities[i] = -np.inf\n            continue\n\n        # Near Fit\n        near_fit_ratio = item / remaining_cap\n        if near_fit_ratio >= near_fit_threshold:\n            priorities[i] += near_fit_bonus\n        \n        if item == remaining_cap:\n            priorities[i] += complete_fill_bonus\n\n        # Fragmentation\n        new_remaining = remaining_cap - item\n        if new_remaining > 0 and (new_remaining / avg_bin_capacity) < small_fragment_threshold:\n            priorities[i] += large_fragment_penalty\n\n        # Capacity Ratio\n        priorities[i] += near_fit_ratio * capacity_ratio_weight\n\n    # If no possible bins are good, make all possible bins minimally acceptable.\n    if not np.any(priorities[possible_bins] > -np.inf):\n        priorities[possible_bins] += 0.001\n        \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective for designing heuristics, considering your tips.\n\nHere's a revised approach focusing on concrete, actionable advice, and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflection:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Weights, Multifaceted, Edge Cases, Simplicity Bias, Experimental Calibration, Dynamic Adjustment, Named Arguments\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics combining multiple factors (near-fit, fragmentation, fill level). Dynamically adjust weights based on problem state. Use named arguments with optimized defaults for scoring parameters. Handle edge cases gracefully.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches. Static, inflexible weighting schemes. Ignoring common problem-specific issues (e.g., fragmentation in packing).\n\n*   **Explanation:** Blend relevant factors, adjusting parameter weights on the fly depending on progress and context, and provide reasonable defaults for all scoring parameters to achieve a better trade-off between solution quality and computation speed.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
