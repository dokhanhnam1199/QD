**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic considers "Near Fit", "Fragmentation Avoidance", and "Complete Fill" with specific bonuses and penalties, while the worst only uses a log ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see the same pattern - the more complex heuristic with defined strategies outperforms the simplistic ratio-based one. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first three heuristics are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) the major difference is heuristic 4 introduces `capacity_ratio_weight` and calculation for  `priorities[i] += (item / remaining_cap) * capacity_ratio_weight` to have a more continuous measure of suitability. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), all three are identical. Comparing (17th) vs (18th), (17th) heuristic is more complex, by consider "Near Fit", "Fragmentation Avoidance", "Complete Fill", "Fill Level Preference", "Avoid Overfill", which gives better result. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors, using bonuses and penalties to guide the item placement process towards desired outcomes (e.g., minimizing fragmentation, maximizing near fits). Simpler approaches relying solely on ratios are less effective. Adding dynamic weights and fill level preferences improves performance. The best heuristics also handle edge cases gracefully, such as when no valid bins are available.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for packing problems, consider combining multiple relevant factors with weighted bonuses and penalties. Prioritize heuristics that address common issues like fragmentation and incomplete filling. Handle edge cases explicitly and dynamically adjust weights based on the current state.
