Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to drive better heuristic design.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, state-dependent, multifaceted scoring, constraint balancing, dynamic prioritization, implicit constraints.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt factor weights based on current bin and item states. Model implicit constraints and balances different potentially conflicting objectives.

*   **Avoid:** Static weights, rigid factor combinations, ignoring state information, and a single-objective focus.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond fixed approaches. Create heuristics that intelligently react to the specific packing situation, balancing factors and addressing implicit constraints dynamically.
