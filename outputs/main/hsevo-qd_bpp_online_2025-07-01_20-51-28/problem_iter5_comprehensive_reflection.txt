Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** State-awareness, dynamic adaptation, problem-specific tuning, factor interaction analysis.

*   **Advice:** Instead of just stating "adjust weights," focus on *how* to adjust them. Think about learning mechanisms (e.g., reinforcement learning, adaptive search) to guide weight tuning based on observed performance and the state of the packing. Also, consider how different factors interact with each other and what happens if those interactions go wrong.

*   **Avoid:** Vague recommendations like "handle edge cases explicitly."

*   **Explanation:** A good heuristic design involves actively observing its performance in different conditions, analyzing its failures to learn better adjustment strategies for parameters, and understanding factor dependencies.
