**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates near-fit, fragmentation avoidance, and capacity ratio, while the worst only uses a logarithmic capacity ratio. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), heuristics 17 and 18 present a similar contrast. The better heuristic adaptively combines multiple factors and handles edge cases. The worst heuristic uses only a ratio.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the codes are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the codes are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the codes are identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the first uses discrete bonuses/penalties, while the third uses adaptive bonuses/penalties based on ratios. The first also includes a complete fill bonus, and a raise score option.

Comparing (14th) vs (16th), 14th uses a first fit preference with an adaptive near fit threshold based on average bin capacity. 16th uses dynamic near fit and fragmentation adjustments as well.

Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple relevant factors (near fit, fragmentation, capacity ratio), use adaptive weights or bonuses, consider edge cases (empty bins, overfill), and sometimes incorporate a slight preference for the first available bin. Simpler heuristics relying on a single metric perform worse. Parameter tuning is important.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics by combining multiple relevant factors and adaptively adjusting weights or bonuses based on the specific problem context. Handle edge cases carefully and consider a slight bias towards simpler solutions (e.g., first-fit) for efficiency. Calibrate parameters via experimentation.
