**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates near-fit, fragmentation avoidance, capacity ratio, complete fill bonuses, and dynamic adjustments, while the worst only uses the inverse log of the item-to-bin capacity ratio.
*   Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), which are both identical with the best one, we see the second best is identical to the best, and second worst is identical to the worst.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see there is no difference between them.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd has same code with 1st and 2nd. 4th version uses a different approach in calculating fragmentation penalty. It also normalizes remaining capacity.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see there is no difference between them.
*   Comparing (9th) vs (10th), they are identical.
*   Comparing (16th) vs (17th), they are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics are characterized by a comprehensive consideration of factors like near-fit, fragmentation, capacity utilization, and employ dynamic adjustments based on the current state of the bin packing process. Adaptive weighting and penalties seem crucial. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on ratios perform poorly.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing (or similar optimization problems), consider multiple factors, and adapt weights/parameters dynamically. Favor comprehensive approaches over simplistic ratios. Penalties for undesirable outcomes (fragmentation) are effective, and normalizing values relative to bin capacity is a good practice.
