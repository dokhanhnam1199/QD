Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Heuristic 1: \"Near Fit\" - Prefer bins where the item fills a significant portion\n    #  but doesn't overflow.

(second best) vs (second worst) are the same, there is no difference between them. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are exactly the same, no difference. (3rd) vs (4th) also the same, nothing changed. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the functions from 11th to 20th use only `ratios = item / bins_remain_cap; log_ratios = np.log(ratios); priorities = -log_ratios` while the others consider multiple factors and are much more complex. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors, including near fit, fragmentation avoidance, and complete filling, while the worse ones rely on a single, simple calculation.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on effectiveness:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Holistic analysis, adaptive weighting, empirical validation, iterative refinement.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze problem components, dynamically adjust factor influence, and rigorously test outcomes.\n*   **Avoid:** Fixating on initial assumptions, neglecting data-driven adjustments, and premature convergence.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static, intuitive heuristics towards dynamically refined approaches grounded in empirical observation and continuous adaptation.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
