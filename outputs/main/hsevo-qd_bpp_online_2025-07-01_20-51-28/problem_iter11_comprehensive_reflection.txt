Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for designing heuristics, considering your tips.

Here's a revised approach focusing on concrete, actionable advice, and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflection:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Weights, Multifaceted, Edge Cases, Simplicity Bias, Experimental Calibration, Dynamic Adjustment, Named Arguments

*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics combining multiple factors (near-fit, fragmentation, fill level). Dynamically adjust weights based on problem state. Use named arguments with optimized defaults for scoring parameters. Handle edge cases gracefully.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches. Static, inflexible weighting schemes. Ignoring common problem-specific issues (e.g., fragmentation in packing).

*   **Explanation:** Blend relevant factors, adjusting parameter weights on the fly depending on progress and context, and provide reasonable defaults for all scoring parameters to achieve a better trade-off between solution quality and computation speed.
