**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates near-fit, fragmentation avoidance, and complete fill bonuses with explicit control over bin qualification and penalties, while the worst uses a simple log ratio. (2nd) vs (19th) shows a similar contrast. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the inclusion of capacity ratio weighting and its effect. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals the impact of handling bins that can't contain items and marking all possible bins minimally acceptable. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we observe no functional difference. Comparing (16th) vs (20th), again no change. Comparing (7th) vs (8th), there's a shift to using named arguments with preset default values, which are optimized, for all parameters affecting scoring. (13th) vs (16th), using dynamic bonus. Overall: The better heuristics use a combination of different strategies.

**Experience:**
Prioritize a multifaceted approach combining near-fit, fragmentation avoidance, complete fill, and fill level considerations. Dynamic weighting of these factors based on the specific item and bin states leads to better performance. Named arguments with optimized default values for all parameters affecting scoring is a good strategy.
