Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

It also normalizes remaining capacity.\n*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see there is no difference between them.\n*   Comparing (9th) vs (10th), they are identical.\n*   Comparing (16th) vs (17th), they are identical.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics are characterized by a comprehensive consideration of factors like near-fit, fragmentation, capacity utilization, and employ dynamic adjustments based on the current state of the bin packing process. Adaptive weighting and penalties seem crucial. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on ratios perform poorly.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined approach to \"Current Self-Reflection\" for heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls, tailored for optimizing bin packing heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, dynamic weighting, fragmentation avoidance, near-fit, complete fill, parameter optimization, edge case handling.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics using a weighted combination of factors like near-fit, minimizing fragmentation, aiming for complete fills, and current fill level. Implement dynamic weighting that adjusts based on the item being packed and the current state of the bins.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on simplistic ratios or single-factor approaches. Neglecting edge cases. Static weighting schemes.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple objectives. Dynamic weighting allows the heuristic to adapt to different scenarios. Experimentation is essential to find optimal default parameter values, providing a solid base for parameter adjustment and improvement.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
