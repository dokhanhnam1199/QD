Okay, here's a refined approach to "Current Self-Reflection" for heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls, tailored for optimizing bin packing heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, dynamic weighting, fragmentation avoidance, near-fit, complete fill, parameter optimization, edge case handling.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics using a weighted combination of factors like near-fit, minimizing fragmentation, aiming for complete fills, and current fill level. Implement dynamic weighting that adjusts based on the item being packed and the current state of the bins.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on simplistic ratios or single-factor approaches. Neglecting edge cases. Static weighting schemes.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple objectives. Dynamic weighting allows the heuristic to adapt to different scenarios. Experimentation is essential to find optimal default parameter values, providing a solid base for parameter adjustment and improvement.
