To refine 'Current self-reflection' and design better heuristics, let's analyze the given texts.

* Keywords: Non-linear prioritization, balance, tight fitting, future capacity, normalization, penalty terms.
* Advice: Focus on creating a balance between fitting items tightly and leaving room for future items using non-linear functions.
* Avoid: Unnecessary complexity, penalty terms, and normalization unless significantly impactful.
* Explanation: The ineffective self-reflection points suggest that while non-linear prioritization is key, simplicity and direct targeting of the problem's objective are crucial. Thus, a balanced approach that avoids unnecessary complexity is ideal.
