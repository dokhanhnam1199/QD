    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is based on the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.
    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item will have the highest priority.
    A bin that is too small for the item will have a priority of negative infinity.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
