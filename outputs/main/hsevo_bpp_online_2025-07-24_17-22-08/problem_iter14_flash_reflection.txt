**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines non-linear prioritization with a penalty for large remaining capacity, using `np.exp(-remaining_cap_after_addition / item) - penalty_weight * remaining_cap_after_addition / bins_remain_cap`, while the worst uses a simple ratio `(bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap`. The top heuristic balances tight fitting and future capacity more effectively. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear prioritization but the 1st includes a penalty term with a tuned weight. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, suggesting a potential tie or redundancy in the ranking. (19th) vs (20th) are also identical, further indicating that the ranking may not always reflect a significant difference between adjacent heuristics. Overall, the top heuristics tend to use more complex, non-linear functions to balance tight fitting and future capacity, and some include normalization or additional balancing terms.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, use non-linear functions to balance tight fitting and future capacity, consider penalty terms for large remaining capacities, and apply normalization or additional balancing terms as needed.
