**Analysis:**
Comparing the top-ranked heuristics (1st) with the lower-ranked ones (e.g., 10th, 20th), we observe that the top heuristics incorporate more nuanced penalty terms and non-linear prioritization. For instance, the 1st heuristic combines non-linear prioritization with a refined penalty term and introduces a slight perturbation. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st heuristic has a more complex combination of scores with a refined penalty term, indicating a potential improvement. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows identical implementations, suggesting a potential redundancy or overfitting in the ranking. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both (19th) and (20th) introduce different penalty terms and prioritization methods, but (20th) lacks the perturbation seen in higher-ranked heuristics. 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to have more sophisticated penalty terms, non-linear prioritization, and perturbations.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, incorporate nuanced penalty terms, non-linear prioritization, and slight perturbations to balance tight fit and future capacity effectively. Analyze and combine successful elements from top-ranked heuristics.
