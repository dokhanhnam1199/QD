**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st and 2nd) with the worst (19th and 20th), we see they share a similar structure but differ in parameter tuning and normalization. The top heuristics use a fixed penalty weight and scale factor, whereas the worst ones use tuned parameters. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical implementations, suggesting a potential tie for the top spot. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a difference in penalty term formulation. Overall, top heuristics balance tight fits and future capacity using non-linear prioritization and refined penalty terms.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on balancing tight fits and future capacity through non-linear prioritization and penalty terms, and consider both fixed and tuned parameters for adaptability.
