Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    The priority is based on a non-linear function that balances between tight fitting and future capacity.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item)), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Return the priority scores\n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines best-fit and tight-fitting heuristics with a simple, non-linear priority score.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Weigh the priority scores by the remaining capacity after addition to encourage tight-fitting\n    valid_bins = priority != -np.inf\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        # Use a non-linear function to balance between tight fitting and future capacity\n        priority[valid_bins] *= (1 + np.tanh(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item - np.mean(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins])))\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics tend to use a non-linear function to balance between tight fitting and future capacity, such as `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item) / item)`, while the worst ones use simpler or less effective non-linear functions. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that dividing by `item` in the exponent makes a difference. \n(3rd) vs (4th) shows that using `bins_remain_cap` as the denominator in the exponent and adding a penalty term can be effective. \nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that using `np.log(bins_remain_cap - item + 2)` is less effective than other non-linear functions. \nOverall, the top heuristics tend to use more sophisticated non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity.\n- \nTo redefine 'Current self-reflection' and come up with better ideas for designing heuristics, let's analyze the given information.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe 'Current self-reflection' suggests using non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity and dividing by relevant variables to improve performance. However, 'Ineffective self-reflection' points out the need to avoid unnecessary complexity and normalization unless it significantly impacts performance.\n\n### Redefined Self-Reflection\n\nHere are the key takeaways in 4 bullet points:\n\n* **Keywords**: Simple, non-linear functions, balancing tight fitting and future capacity.\n* **Advice**: Use intuitive logic targeting the problem's objective, and consider non-linear functions that prioritize bins based on remaining capacity.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary normalization and complexity, penalty terms unless significantly impactful.\n* **Explanation**: The goal is to strike a balance between fitting items tightly and leaving room for future items, using simple yet effective logic to guide the heuristic design.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
