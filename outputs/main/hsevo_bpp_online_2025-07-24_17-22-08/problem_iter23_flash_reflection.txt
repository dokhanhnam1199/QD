**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a simple yet effective non-linear prioritization based on the remaining capacity, while the worst heuristic complicates the prioritization with additional logarithmic adjustments. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear prioritization, but (2nd) introduces a refined penalty term, suggesting that a balance between simplicity and penalty terms is crucial.
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that applying additional penalties or adjustments can degrade performance if not done carefully, as (3rd) and (4th) are very similar but (4th) lacks an additional penalty.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (19th) and (20th) are identical, indicating that the worst heuristic might not be the worst if slightly modified.
Overall, effective heuristics tend to strike a balance between non-linear prioritization and penalty terms or balancing factors, without overly complicating the calculations.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simple, effective non-linear prioritization and balance it with appropriate penalty or balancing terms, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
