    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prefers bins that have just enough capacity for the item.
    It uses a negative exponential function to assign higher priority to bins 
    with remaining capacity close to the item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, np.exp(-diff), -1e9)
