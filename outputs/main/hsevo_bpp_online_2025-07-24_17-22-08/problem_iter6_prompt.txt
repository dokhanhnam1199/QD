Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    The priority is based on the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.\n    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item will have the highest priority.\n    A bin that is too small for the item will have a priority of negative infinity.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, bins_remain_cap - item, -np.inf)\n    \n    # Then, we normalize the priority scores so that the bin with the smallest remaining capacity \n    # that is still enough for the item gets the highest priority\n    priority = -priority\n    \n    # Return the priority scores\n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n* **Keywords**: Non-linear functions, remaining capacity, trade-off, intuitive logic\n* **Advice**: Use complex prioritization and consider future implications\n* **Avoid**: Simple, tight-fitting logic and unnecessary normalization\n* **Explanation**: By using non-linear functions and considering the trade-off between fitting items tightly and leaving room for future items, we can create more effective heuristics that go beyond straightforward, intuitive logic.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
