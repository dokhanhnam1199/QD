**Analysis:**
Comparing the top-ranked heuristics (1st) vs the lower-ranked ones (e.g., 20th), we see that the top heuristics tend to have more complex and nuanced priority calculations, often incorporating multiple factors such as tight fit, future capacity, and non-linear penalty terms. For instance, the 1st heuristic uses a combination of `np.exp(-remain_cap_after_add / item) * (1 + tight_fit_measure)` and a penalty term, whereas the 20th heuristic uses a simpler `-np.log1p(proportion_remain)`. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are nearly identical, suggesting that the top heuristics may have converged to a similar optimal solution. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we again see similar patterns. However, as we move down the list, we notice that the heuristics become simpler and less nuanced, with some (e.g., 20th) using a single penalty term without considering multiple factors. Overall, the top heuristics tend to be more sophisticated and adaptable, while the lower-ranked ones are simpler and less effective.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple factors (tight fit, future capacity, non-linear penalties) and introduce nuanced calculations (e.g., dynamic penalty terms, non-linear prioritization). Avoid oversimplification and consider adaptability and robustness.
