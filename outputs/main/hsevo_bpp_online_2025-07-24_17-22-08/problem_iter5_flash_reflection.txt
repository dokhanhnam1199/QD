**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that both prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after adding the item, but the best uses an exponential function to prioritize bins with remaining capacity closer to the item size, while the worst uses a First-Fit decreasing heuristic. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first uses an exponential function, while the second uses a linear function to prioritize bins. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that both use a similar approach, but the third uses a reciprocal function, while the fourth uses a simple subtraction. 
Overall, the better heuristics tend to use more sophisticated functions to prioritize bins, such as exponential or reciprocal functions.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, use non-linear functions that prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after adding the item, and consider the trade-off between fitting the item tightly and leaving room for future items.
