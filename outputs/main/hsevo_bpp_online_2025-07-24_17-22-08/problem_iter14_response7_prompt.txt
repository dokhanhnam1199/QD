Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a penalty for large remaining capacity.\n    Balances tight fitting and future capacity by using bins_remain_cap in the exponent.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if item fits and calculate remaining capacity after addition\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Non-linear priority with a penalty term for large remaining capacity\n    # Divide by item in the exponent to balance tight fitting and future capacity\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins == 1, np.exp(-remaining_cap_after_addition / item) - 0.01 * remaining_cap_after_addition / bins_remain_cap, 0)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    The priority is based on the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.\n    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item and has a larger remaining capacity after packing will have a higher priority.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n    \n    # Return the priority scores\n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines non-linear prioritization with a penalty for large remaining capacity, using `np.exp(-remaining_cap_after_addition / item) - penalty_weight * remaining_cap_after_addition / bins_remain_cap`, while the worst uses a simple ratio `(bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap`. The top heuristic balances tight fitting and future capacity more effectively. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear prioritization but the 1st includes a penalty term with a tuned weight. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, suggesting a potential tie or redundancy in the ranking. (19th) vs (20th) are also identical, further indicating that the ranking may not always reflect a significant difference between adjacent heuristics. Overall, the top heuristics tend to use more complex, non-linear functions to balance tight fitting and future capacity, and some include normalization or additional balancing terms.\n- \nTo improve the heuristics design, let's analyze the given information.\n\n* Keywords: non-linear functions, balance, tight fitting, future capacity, normalization, penalty terms\n* Advice: Focus on simple and intuitive logic; use non-linear functions to prioritize bins based on remaining capacity; balance tight fitting and future capacity.\n* Avoid: Unnecessary normalization, unnecessary complexity, penalty terms unless significantly impactful.\n* Explanation: Redefining 'Current self-reflection' involves combining the effective aspects while avoiding the ineffective ones, resulting in using simple, non-linear functions that balance the trade-off between tight fitting and future capacity, with a focus on intuitive logic.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
