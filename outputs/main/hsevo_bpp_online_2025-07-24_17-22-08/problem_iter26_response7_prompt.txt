Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a refined penalty term for balance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remain_cap_after_add = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Non-linear prioritization with a refined penalty for large remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, \n                         np.exp(-remain_cap_after_add / item) / (1 + remain_cap_after_add), \n                         -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    The priority is based on the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.\n    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item will have the highest priority.\n    A bin that is too small for the item will have a priority of negative infinity.\n    The priority also considers the future capacity of the bin after packing the item.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Then, we apply a penalty term to bins that will be too full after packing the item\n    # This term encourages leaving some capacity for future items\n    penalty_term = np.where(bins_remain_cap - item > 0, (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap, 0)\n    priority *= penalty_term\n    \n    # Return the priority scores\n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best (Heuristics 1st) and the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a combination of non-linear prioritization and a penalty term to encourage tighter fits, while the worst heuristic uses a similar approach but with redundant imports and less optimal balancing terms. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use non-linear prioritization but the first one applies a more refined penalty term. \n(3rd) vs (4th) are identical, indicating a potential redundancy in the list. \nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, suggesting that the worst heuristics are repetitive. \nOverall, effective heuristics tend to balance non-linear prioritization with penalty terms for large remaining capacities and avoid unnecessary imports.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's the analysis:\n\n* **Keywords**: Non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, simplicity, tight fitting, future capacity.\n* **Advice**: Focus on simple, effective non-linear prioritization that balances tight fitting and future capacity. Consider refining penalty terms and balancing strategies to optimize bin selection.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and ineffective normalization or penalty terms that don't significantly impact performance.\n* **Explanation**: By simplifying and refining non-linear prioritization, and balancing tight fitting with future capacity, we can create more effective heuristics that optimize the bin selection process.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
