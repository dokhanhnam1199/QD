Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a penalty for large remaining capacity.\n    Balances tight fitting and future capacity effectively.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    \n    # Non-linear priority with a penalty for large remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins == 1, np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item)), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Adjust priority to balance between tight fitting and future capacity\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins == 1, priority * (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap, priority)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a balance term for tight fitting and future capacity.\n    Uses np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item) / item) and a balancing term for valid bins.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate priority score using a non-linear function for valid bins\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item) / item), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Apply a balancing term to valid bins to prioritize bins that are not too full\n    valid_bins = priority != -np.inf\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n        # Balance between tight fitting and future capacity\n        priority[valid_bins] *= (remaining_cap_after_addition / bins_remain_cap[valid_bins])\n        \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of non-linear prioritization and balancing terms to effectively manage tight fitting and future capacity. The best heuristics (1st and 2nd) utilize `np.exp` functions with adjustments for remaining capacity, while the worst (18th, 19th, 20th) use a mix of squared terms and logarithmic functions. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use non-linear prioritization but differ in normalization and penalty terms. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a progression towards more complex balancing terms. Overall, the top heuristics tend to use more refined non-linear functions and balancing terms.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n* **Keywords:** Non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, normalization, penalty strategies.\n* **Advice:** \n    - Refine non-linear prioritization to balance tight fitting and future capacity.\n    - Experiment with different normalization and penalty strategies.\n* **Avoid:** \n    - Unnecessary complexity.\n    - Overemphasis on simple, intuitive logic that doesn't consider the trade-offs.\n* **Explanation:** Redefining 'Current self-reflection' involves synthesizing the effective aspects from both sections, emphasizing the importance of non-linear prioritization and balancing terms while avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on strategies that significantly impact performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
