**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic prioritizes bins based on the remaining capacity after adding the item, while the worst heuristic implements a First-Fit decreasing heuristic with normalization. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, but (1st) directly uses the remaining capacity after addition, whereas (2nd) calculates the negative of the remaining capacity after addition.
(3rd) vs (4th) shows similar logic with slight variations in calculation.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both implement First-Fit decreasing heuristic.
Overall: Top heuristics tend to prioritize bins based on how well the item fits, with a focus on minimizing remaining capacity.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simple, intuitive logic that directly targets the problem's objective, such as minimizing waste by fitting items tightly into bins. Avoid unnecessary normalization unless it significantly impacts performance.
