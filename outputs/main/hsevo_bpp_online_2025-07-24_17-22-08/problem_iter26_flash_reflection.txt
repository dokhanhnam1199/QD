**Analysis:**
Comparing the best (Heuristics 1st) and the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a combination of non-linear prioritization and a penalty term to encourage tighter fits, while the worst heuristic uses a similar approach but with redundant imports and less optimal balancing terms. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use non-linear prioritization but the first one applies a more refined penalty term. 
(3rd) vs (4th) are identical, indicating a potential redundancy in the list. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, suggesting that the worst heuristics are repetitive. 
Overall, effective heuristics tend to balance non-linear prioritization with penalty terms for large remaining capacities and avoid unnecessary imports.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on balancing non-linear prioritization with refined penalty terms and avoid redundant code and unnecessary imports.
