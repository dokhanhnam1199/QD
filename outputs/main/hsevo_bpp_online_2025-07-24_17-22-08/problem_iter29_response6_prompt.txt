Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The top heuristics use a fixed penalty weight and scale factor, whereas the worst ones use tuned parameters. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical implementations, suggesting a potential tie for the top spot. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a difference in penalty term formulation. Overall, top heuristics balance tight fits and future capacity using non-linear prioritization and refined penalty terms.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information.\n\n* **Keywords**: non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, tight fitting, future capacity, simplicity.\n* **Advice**: Focus on creating simple yet effective non-linear prioritization functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider thoughtful balancing terms.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, unnecessary normalization, and ineffective penalty terms.\n* **Explanation**: By avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on simple, effective non-linear prioritization, we can create better heuristics that balance competing objectives like tight fitting and future capacity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
