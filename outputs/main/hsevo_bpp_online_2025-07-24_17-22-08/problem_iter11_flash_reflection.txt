**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics tend to use a non-linear function to balance between tight fitting and future capacity, such as `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item) / item)`, while the worst ones use simpler or less effective non-linear functions. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that dividing by `item` in the exponent makes a difference. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that using `bins_remain_cap` as the denominator in the exponent and adding a penalty term can be effective. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that using `np.log(bins_remain_cap - item + 2)` is less effective than other non-linear functions. 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to use more sophisticated non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, use non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider dividing by relevant variables like `item` to improve performance.
