To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information.

* **Keywords**: non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, tight fitting, future capacity, simplicity.
* **Advice**: Focus on creating simple yet effective non-linear prioritization functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider thoughtful balancing terms.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, unnecessary normalization, and ineffective penalty terms.
* **Explanation**: By avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on simple, effective non-linear prioritization, we can create better heuristics that balance competing objectives like tight fitting and future capacity.
