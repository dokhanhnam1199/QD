**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a simple, normalized priority score based on the remaining capacity, while the worst uses a logarithmic function with a penalty term. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear functions, but the 1st normalizes the priority scores directly, whereas the 2nd normalizes after applying a reciprocal function. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that both combine elements of best-fit and tight-fitting heuristics, but the 3rd weighs priority scores by remaining capacity, whereas the 4th uses a non-linear function with an additional term for future items. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are almost identical, using a logarithmic function with a penalty term. 
Overall, top heuristics tend to use simpler, more direct normalization and non-linear functions, while worse heuristics often introduce additional complexity or penalty terms.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simple, normalized priority scores and non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and penalty terms.
