Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Priority score for each bin based on a non-linear function of remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    Combines elements of priority_v0 and avoids unnecessary normalization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if item fits and calculate remaining capacity after addition\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)  \n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Use a non-linear function to prioritize bins with remaining capacity closest to zero\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins == 1, np.exp(-remaining_cap_after_addition / bins_remain_cap), 0)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    The priority is based on a non-linear function of the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.\n    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item and leaves some room for future items will have the highest priority.\n    A bin that is too small for the item will have a priority of negative infinity.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, np.log(bins_remain_cap - item + 1), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Then, we add a penalty term to bins with very large remaining capacity to encourage tighter packing\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, priority - 0.1 * (bins_remain_cap - item) / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-6), priority)\n    \n    # Return the priority scores\n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a simple, normalized priority score based on the remaining capacity, while the worst uses a logarithmic function with a penalty term. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear functions, but the 1st normalizes the priority scores directly, whereas the 2nd normalizes after applying a reciprocal function. \n(3rd) vs (4th) shows that both combine elements of best-fit and tight-fitting heuristics, but the 3rd weighs priority scores by remaining capacity, whereas the 4th uses a non-linear function with an additional term for future items. \nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are almost identical, using a logarithmic function with a penalty term. \nOverall, top heuristics tend to use simpler, more direct normalization and non-linear functions, while worse heuristics often introduce additional complexity or penalty terms.\n- \nTo redesign 'Current self-reflection' and come up with ideas to design better heuristics while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's first analyze the given inputs.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Current self-reflection** suggests focusing on simple, normalized priority scores and non-linear functions that balance between tight fitting and future capacity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and penalty terms.\n- **Ineffective self-reflection** advises using simple, intuitive logic targeting the problem's objective directly, like minimizing waste. It suggests using non-linear functions to prioritize bins based on remaining capacity and considering the trade-off between tight fitting and future capacity, avoiding unnecessary normalization.\n\n### Redefining 'Current self-reflection'\n\nBy synthesizing insights from both, we can redefine 'Current self-reflection' to be more effective.\n\n### Response\n\nHere are the key points in 4 bullet points (<100 words):\n* **Keywords**: Simple logic, non-linear functions, balance, intuitive.\n* **Advice**: Use non-linear functions to balance tight fitting and future capacity; directly target the problem's objective.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, penalty terms, and normalization unless significantly impactful.\n* **Explanation**: By combining simplicity with non-linear prioritization, heuristics can effectively minimize waste and optimize bin usage, directly addressing the problem's objectives without unnecessary complications.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
