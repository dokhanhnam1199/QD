{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple factors (tight fit, future capacity, non-linear penalties) and introduce nuanced calculations (e.g., dynamic penalty terms, non-linear prioritization). Avoid oversimplification and consider adaptability and robustness.\nTo design better heuristics, focus on balancing non-linear prioritization with refined penalty terms and avoid redundant code and unnecessary imports.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simple, intuitive logic that directly targets the problem's objective, such as minimizing waste by fitting items tightly into bins. Avoid unnecessary normalization unless it significantly impacts performance.\n\nTo design better heuristics, use non-linear functions that prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after adding the item, and consider the trade-off between fitting the item tightly and leaving room for future items.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simple, normalized priority scores and non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and penalty terms.\n\nTo design better heuristics, use non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider dividing by relevant variables like `item` to improve performance.\n\nTo design better heuristics, use non-linear functions to balance tight fitting and future capacity, consider penalty terms for large remaining capacities, and apply normalization or additional balancing terms as needed.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on creating non-linear prioritization functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and apply thoughtful balancing terms to optimize the bin selection process.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on refining non-linear prioritization functions and incorporating effective balancing terms that consider both tight fitting and future capacity, and experiment with different normalization and penalty strategies.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simple, effective non-linear prioritization and balance it with appropriate penalty or balancing terms, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on balancing tight fits and future capacity through non-linear prioritization and penalty terms, and consider both fixed and tuned parameters for adaptability.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining non-linear prioritization with nuanced penalty terms that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider the trade-off between complexity and effectiveness.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
