def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is based on a non-linear function of the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.
    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item will have a relatively high priority.
    A bin that is too small for the item will have a priority of negative infinity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
