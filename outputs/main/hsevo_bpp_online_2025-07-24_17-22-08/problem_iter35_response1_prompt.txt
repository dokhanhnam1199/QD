Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Enhances the priority function by introducing a more nuanced non-linear prioritization \n    and a dynamic penalty term that adapts based on the item size and bin capacity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identify valid bins\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    \n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item and its proportion to the item size\n    remain_cap_after_add = bins_remain_cap - item\n    proportion_remain = remain_cap_after_add / item\n    \n    # Non-linear prioritization with a dynamic penalty term that considers the relative remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins == 1, \n                         np.exp(-proportion_remain) - 0.05 * (proportion_remain ** 2),  # More nuanced penalty for larger remaining capacity relative to item size\n                         -np.inf)\n    \n    # Apply a bonus for bins with very tight fits to encourage efficient packing\n    tight_fit_bonus = np.where((remain_cap_after_add > 0) & (remain_cap_after_add < 0.1 * item), 0.1, 0)\n    priority += tight_fit_bonus\n    \n    # Normalize priority scores for adaptability, handling the case where all priorities are -inf\n    max_priority = np.max(priority)\n    if max_priority != -np.inf:\n        priority = priority / max_priority\n    else:\n        priority = valid_bins - 1  # When all bins are invalid, return -1 for invalid bins\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a refined penalty term for better bin selection.\n    Balances tight fitting and future capacity using a nuanced formulation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Non-linear prioritization for bins with sufficient capacity, normalized by item size\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item) / item), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Refined penalty term to balance tight fitting and future capacity\n    valid_bins = priority != -np.inf\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        # Use a term that considers both remaining capacity and item size\n        balancing_term = 1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item))\n        priority[valid_bins] *= balancing_term * ((bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[valid_bins])\n        \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the top-ranked heuristics (1st) vs the lower-ranked ones (e.g., 20th), we see that the top heuristics tend to have more complex and nuanced priority calculations, often incorporating multiple factors such as tight fit, future capacity, and non-linear penalty terms. For instance, the 1st heuristic uses a combination of `np.exp(-remain_cap_after_add / item) * (1 + tight_fit_measure)` and a penalty term, whereas the 20th heuristic uses a simpler `-np.log1p(proportion_remain)`. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are nearly identical, suggesting that the top heuristics may have converged to a similar optimal solution. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we again see similar patterns. However, as we move down the list, we notice that the heuristics become simpler and less nuanced, with some (e.g., 20th) using a single penalty term without considering multiple factors. Overall, the top heuristics tend to be more sophisticated and adaptable, while the lower-ranked ones are simpler and less effective.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n* **Keywords**: non-linear prioritization, penalty terms, tight fitting, future capacity, balancing, simplicity.\n* **Advice**: Combine non-linear prioritization with nuanced penalty terms, balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider simplicity and adaptability.\n* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and excessive normalization.\n* **Explanation**: Effective heuristics require a balance between competing factors (tight fitting and future capacity) using non-linear prioritization and penalty terms, while maintaining simplicity and adaptability to optimize performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
