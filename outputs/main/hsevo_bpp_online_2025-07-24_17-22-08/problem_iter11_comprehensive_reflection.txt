To redefine 'Current self-reflection' and come up with better ideas for designing heuristics, let's analyze the given information.

### Analysis

The 'Current self-reflection' suggests using non-linear functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity and dividing by relevant variables to improve performance. However, 'Ineffective self-reflection' points out the need to avoid unnecessary complexity and normalization unless it significantly impacts performance.

### Redefined Self-Reflection

Here are the key takeaways in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Simple, non-linear functions, balancing tight fitting and future capacity.
* **Advice**: Use intuitive logic targeting the problem's objective, and consider non-linear functions that prioritize bins based on remaining capacity.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary normalization and complexity, penalty terms unless significantly impactful.
* **Explanation**: The goal is to strike a balance between fitting items tightly and leaving room for future items, using simple yet effective logic to guide the heuristic design.
