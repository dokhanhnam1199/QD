To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:

* **Keywords**: Non-linear functions, remaining capacity, trade-off, intuitive logic
* **Advice**: Use complex prioritization and consider future implications
* **Avoid**: Simple, tight-fitting logic and unnecessary normalization
* **Explanation**: By using non-linear functions and considering the trade-off between fitting items tightly and leaving room for future items, we can create more effective heuristics that go beyond straightforward, intuitive logic.
