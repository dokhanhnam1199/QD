To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:

* **Keywords:** Non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, normalization, penalty strategies.
* **Advice:** 
    - Refine non-linear prioritization to balance tight fitting and future capacity.
    - Experiment with different normalization and penalty strategies.
* **Avoid:** 
    - Unnecessary complexity.
    - Overemphasis on simple, intuitive logic that doesn't consider the trade-offs.
* **Explanation:** Redefining 'Current self-reflection' involves synthesizing the effective aspects from both sections, emphasizing the importance of non-linear prioritization and balancing terms while avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on strategies that significantly impact performance.
