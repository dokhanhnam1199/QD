**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a non-linear function that balances tight fitting and future capacity effectively. The worst heuristic, on the other hand, applies multiple balancing terms and uses a simple, intuitive logic. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear prioritization but the first one includes an additional penalty for large remaining capacity. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that the third heuristic balances between tight fitting and future capacity by considering remaining capacity in a non-linear way, whereas the fourth does not. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both apply multiple balancing terms but with different approaches. 
Overall, effective non-linear prioritization and balancing terms that consider both tight fitting and future capacity are key characteristics of better heuristics.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on creating non-linear prioritization functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and apply thoughtful balancing terms to optimize the bin selection process.
