{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, use non-linear functions that prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after adding the item, and consider the trade-off between fitting the item tightly and leaving room for future items.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simple, intuitive logic that directly targets the problem's objective, such as minimizing waste by fitting items tightly into bins. Avoid unnecessary normalization unless it significantly impacts performance.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
