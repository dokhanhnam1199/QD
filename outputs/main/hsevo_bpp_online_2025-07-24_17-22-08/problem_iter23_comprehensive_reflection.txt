To provide a redefined 'Current self-reflection' that avoids the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

### Redefined Current self-reflection
- **Keywords**: Simple, non-linear prioritization, balance, penalty terms, normalization.
- **Advice**: Focus on creating effective non-linear prioritization functions that consider both tight fitting and future capacity. Balance these functions with thoughtful penalty or balancing terms. 
- **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, ineffective normalization, and penalty terms that don't significantly impact performance. Avoid overly simplistic or rigid logic that doesn't adapt to the problem's nuances.
- **Explanation**: By focusing on simple yet effective non-linear prioritization and balancing it with appropriate terms, we can design better heuristics. This approach avoids the pitfalls of unnecessary complexity and inefficiency by emphasizing adaptability and performance impact.

Let's break it down into 4 bullet points as requested:
* **Keywords**: Simple, non-linear, balance, normalization
* **Advice**: Create non-linear prioritization functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and apply thoughtful balancing terms.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, ineffective normalization, and rigid logic.
* **Explanation**: Emphasize adaptability and performance impact to design effective heuristics.
