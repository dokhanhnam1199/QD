**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of non-linear prioritization and balancing terms to effectively manage tight fitting and future capacity. The best heuristics (1st and 2nd) utilize `np.exp` functions with adjustments for remaining capacity, while the worst (18th, 19th, 20th) use a mix of squared terms and logarithmic functions. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use non-linear prioritization but differ in normalization and penalty terms. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a progression towards more complex balancing terms. Overall, the top heuristics tend to use more refined non-linear functions and balancing terms.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on refining non-linear prioritization functions and incorporating effective balancing terms that consider both tight fitting and future capacity, and experiment with different normalization and penalty strategies.
