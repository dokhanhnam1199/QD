To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. 

* **Keywords**: Non-linear prioritization, nuanced penalty terms, balancing tight fitting and future capacity.
* **Advice**: Combine non-linear prioritization with refined penalty terms, and consider trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and overly simplistic approaches that don't balance competing objectives.
* **Explanation**: The goal is to create heuristics that effectively balance competing demands, such as tight fitting and future capacity, using non-linear prioritization and thoughtful penalty terms, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
