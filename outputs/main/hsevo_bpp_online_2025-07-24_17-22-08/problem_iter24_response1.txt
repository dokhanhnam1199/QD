    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is based on a combination of the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item,
    incorporating a non-linear prioritization that balances tight fitting and future capacity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
