Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

For example, Heuristics 1st and 2nd use `np.exp` for non-linear prioritization and incorporate terms that consider both remaining capacity and item size. In contrast, lower-ranked heuristics like 19th and 20th, although similar in structure, lack the nuanced balancing terms seen in the top heuristics. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear prioritization but differ in their penalty terms; the 1st heuristic incorporates a more complex balancing term. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a similar pattern, with the 3rd using a simpler yet effective non-linear prioritization. Overall, the top heuristics strike a balance between complexity and effectiveness in their prioritization and penalty terms.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. \n\n* **Keywords**: Non-linear prioritization, nuanced penalty terms, balancing tight fitting and future capacity.\n* **Advice**: Combine non-linear prioritization with refined penalty terms, and consider trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and overly simplistic approaches that don't balance competing objectives.\n* **Explanation**: The goal is to create heuristics that effectively balance competing demands, such as tight fitting and future capacity, using non-linear prioritization and thoughtful penalty terms, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
