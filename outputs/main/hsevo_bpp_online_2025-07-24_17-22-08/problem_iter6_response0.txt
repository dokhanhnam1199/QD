    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is based on a non-linear function of the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
