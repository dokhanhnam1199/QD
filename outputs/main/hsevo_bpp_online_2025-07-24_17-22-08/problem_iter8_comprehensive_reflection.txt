To redesign 'Current self-reflection' and come up with ideas to design better heuristics while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's first analyze the given inputs.

### Analysis

- **Current self-reflection** suggests focusing on simple, normalized priority scores and non-linear functions that balance between tight fitting and future capacity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and penalty terms.
- **Ineffective self-reflection** advises using simple, intuitive logic targeting the problem's objective directly, like minimizing waste. It suggests using non-linear functions to prioritize bins based on remaining capacity and considering the trade-off between tight fitting and future capacity, avoiding unnecessary normalization.

### Redefining 'Current self-reflection'

By synthesizing insights from both, we can redefine 'Current self-reflection' to be more effective.

### Response

Here are the key points in 4 bullet points (<100 words):
* **Keywords**: Simple logic, non-linear functions, balance, intuitive.
* **Advice**: Use non-linear functions to balance tight fitting and future capacity; directly target the problem's objective.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, penalty terms, and normalization unless significantly impactful.
* **Explanation**: By combining simplicity with non-linear prioritization, heuristics can effectively minimize waste and optimize bin usage, directly addressing the problem's objectives without unnecessary complications.
