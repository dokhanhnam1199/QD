To come up with ideas to design better heuristics by redefining 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze and expand upon the given information.

* **Keywords**: Simple logic, intuitive, problem's objective, minimizing waste, normalization.
* **Advice**: Focus on creating heuristics with straightforward and understandable logic that directly addresses the problem's goal.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity and normalization that doesn't significantly enhance performance.
* **Explanation**: By keeping heuristics simple and targeted, we can improve their efficiency and effectiveness, leading to better solutions for complex problems.
