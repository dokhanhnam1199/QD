To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's the analysis:

* **Keywords**: Non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, simplicity, tight fitting, future capacity.
* **Advice**: Focus on simple, effective non-linear prioritization that balances tight fitting and future capacity. Consider refining penalty terms and balancing strategies to optimize bin selection.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and ineffective normalization or penalty terms that don't significantly impact performance.
* **Explanation**: By simplifying and refining non-linear prioritization, and balancing tight fitting with future capacity, we can create more effective heuristics that optimize the bin selection process.
