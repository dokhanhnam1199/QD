To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:

* **Keywords**: non-linear prioritization, penalty terms, tight fitting, future capacity, balancing, simplicity.
* **Advice**: Combine non-linear prioritization with nuanced penalty terms, balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider simplicity and adaptability.
* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, unnecessary complexity, redundant code, and excessive normalization.
* **Explanation**: Effective heuristics require a balance between competing factors (tight fitting and future capacity) using non-linear prioritization and penalty terms, while maintaining simplicity and adaptability to optimize performance.
