Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    The priority is based on the remaining capacity of the bin and the size of the item.\n    A bin with a remaining capacity that is just enough for the item will have the highest priority.\n    A bin that is too small for the item will have a priority of negative infinity.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # First, we identify bins that are too small for the item and give them a very low priority\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, bins_remain_cap - item, -np.inf)\n    \n    # Then, we normalize the priority scores so that the bin with the smallest remaining capacity \n    # that is still enough for the item gets the highest priority\n    priority = -priority\n    \n    # Return the priority scores\n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo improve the heuristics design, let's analyze the given information.\n\n* Keywords: non-linear functions, balance, tight fitting, future capacity, normalization, penalty terms\n* Advice: Focus on simple and intuitive logic; use non-linear functions to prioritize bins based on remaining capacity; balance tight fitting and future capacity.\n* Avoid: Unnecessary normalization, unnecessary complexity, penalty terms unless significantly impactful.\n* Explanation: Redefining 'Current self-reflection' involves combining the effective aspects while avoiding the ineffective ones, resulting in using simple, non-linear functions that balance the trade-off between tight fitting and future capacity, with a focus on intuitive logic.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
