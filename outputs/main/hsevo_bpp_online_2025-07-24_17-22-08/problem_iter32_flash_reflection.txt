**Analysis:**
Comparing the top-ranked heuristics with the lower-ranked ones, we observe that the top heuristics tend to use a combination of non-linear prioritization and refined penalty terms to balance tight fitting and future capacity. For example, Heuristics 1st and 2nd use `np.exp` for non-linear prioritization and incorporate terms that consider both remaining capacity and item size. In contrast, lower-ranked heuristics like 19th and 20th, although similar in structure, lack the nuanced balancing terms seen in the top heuristics. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use non-linear prioritization but differ in their penalty terms; the 1st heuristic incorporates a more complex balancing term. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a similar pattern, with the 3rd using a simpler yet effective non-linear prioritization. Overall, the top heuristics strike a balance between complexity and effectiveness in their prioritization and penalty terms.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining non-linear prioritization with nuanced penalty terms that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider the trade-off between complexity and effectiveness.
