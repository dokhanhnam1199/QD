To improve the heuristics design, let's analyze the given information.

* Keywords: non-linear functions, balance, tight fitting, future capacity, normalization, penalty terms
* Advice: Focus on simple and intuitive logic; use non-linear functions to prioritize bins based on remaining capacity; balance tight fitting and future capacity.
* Avoid: Unnecessary normalization, unnecessary complexity, penalty terms unless significantly impactful.
* Explanation: Redefining 'Current self-reflection' involves combining the effective aspects while avoiding the ineffective ones, resulting in using simple, non-linear functions that balance the trade-off between tight fitting and future capacity, with a focus on intuitive logic.
