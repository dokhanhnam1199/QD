To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding the pitfalls in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:

* **Keywords**: Non-linear prioritization, nuanced penalty terms, balancing tight fit and future capacity.
* **Advice**: Focus on combining non-linear prioritization with refined penalty terms and effective balancing terms to optimize bin selection.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, oversimplification, redundant code, and unnecessary normalization or penalty terms.
* **Explanation**: By striking a balance between competing factors and avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can create more effective heuristics that adapt to different scenarios.
