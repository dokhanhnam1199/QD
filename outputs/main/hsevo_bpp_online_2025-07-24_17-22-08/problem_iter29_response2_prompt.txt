Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a refined balancing term for optimal bin selection.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remain_cap_after_add = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Non-linear prioritization with a penalty for large remaining capacity and a balancing term\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, \n                         np.exp(-remain_cap_after_add / item) * (1 - remain_cap_after_add / bins_remain_cap), \n                         -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                penalty_weight: float = 0.2226320942296571, \n                exp_scale_factor: float = 3.2571208170312453) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines non-linear prioritization with a refined penalty term for tighter fits and future capacity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identify valid bins and calculate remaining capacity after adding the item\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    remain_cap_after_add = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Non-linear prioritization with a penalty for large remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins == 1, \n                         np.exp(-remain_cap_after_add / (item * exp_scale_factor)) - penalty_weight * remain_cap_after_add,  \n                         -np.inf)\n    \n    # Normalize priority scores for better adaptability\n    max_priority = np.max(priority)\n    if max_priority != -np.inf:\n        priority = priority / max_priority\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st and 2nd) with the worst (19th and 20th), we see they share a similar structure but differ in parameter tuning and normalization. The top heuristics use a fixed penalty weight and scale factor, whereas the worst ones use tuned parameters. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical implementations, suggesting a potential tie for the top spot. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a difference in penalty term formulation. Overall, top heuristics balance tight fits and future capacity using non-linear prioritization and refined penalty terms.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information.\n\n* **Keywords**: non-linear prioritization, balancing terms, tight fitting, future capacity, simplicity.\n* **Advice**: Focus on creating simple yet effective non-linear prioritization functions that balance tight fitting and future capacity, and consider thoughtful balancing terms.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant code, unnecessary normalization, and ineffective penalty terms.\n* **Explanation**: By avoiding unnecessary complexity and focusing on simple, effective non-linear prioritization, we can create better heuristics that balance competing objectives like tight fitting and future capacity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
