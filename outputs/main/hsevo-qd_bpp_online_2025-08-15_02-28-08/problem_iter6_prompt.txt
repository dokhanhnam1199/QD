Leverage vectorization for computational efficiency.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear scoring functions requiring extensive tuning and obscure array manipulations.\n*   **Explanation:** Focusing on robust, simple metrics and efficient implementation leads to more reliable, maintainable, and adaptable heuristics, crucial for dynamic optimization problems.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
