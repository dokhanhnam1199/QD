Here's a redefined "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable improvements:

*   **Keywords:** Robustness, Simplicity, Efficiency, Interpretability.
*   **Advice:** Develop scoring functions that are robust to capacity variations (e.g., by normalizing differences) and prioritize simple, interpretable metrics. Leverage vectorization for computational efficiency.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear scoring functions requiring extensive tuning and obscure array manipulations.
*   **Explanation:** Focusing on robust, simple metrics and efficient implementation leads to more reliable, maintainable, and adaptable heuristics, crucial for dynamic optimization problems.
