The extensive commented-out exploration in Heuristic 2 doesn't translate to a distinct improvement or change in the final implemented logic compared to Heuristic 1.\n\nComparing Heuristic 3 and Heuristic 12/13/14: Heuristic 3 uses `bins_remain_cap / (diff + epsilon)`, similar to Heuristic 1. Heuristics 12, 13, and 14 introduce a tiered approach: highest priority for exact fits (score 2.0), and medium priority for non-exact fits based on normalized differences (scaled to be less than 2.0, e.g., `1.0 - normalized_diff + 0.1`). This tiered approach is more sophisticated than a single scoring function.\n\nComparing Heuristic 6 and Heuristic 7: Heuristic 6 uses a two-tier system: 1.0 for exact fits, and then normalized scores (0.0-0.9) for non-exact fits based on inverse of excess capacity relative to the minimum excess. Heuristic 7 is similar but assigns 2.0 to exact fits and scales non-exact fits to [0.1, 1.0]. The normalization in Heuristic 7 might be more robust if the range of excess capacities is large.\n\nComparing Heuristic 10/11 and Heuristic 16/17/19: Heuristics 10, 11 use a fixed priority of 1.0 for exact fits and scale non-exact fits to a range [0.5, 0.99] based on inverse normalized excess. Heuristics 16, 17, 19 also give 1.0 to exact fits but scale non-exact fits to a range like [0.1, 0.9] using inverse excess capacity relative to the maximum inverse excess capacity. The scaling in 16/17/19 seems more nuanced for ranking close fits.\n\nComparing Heuristic 8 and Heuristic 9: Heuristic 8 sorts available bins by remaining capacity and then assigns ranks based on sorted priorities (which appears to be a form of inverse remaining capacity). Heuristic 9 directly uses the inverse of available capacity (not excess capacity) and normalizes it. Heuristic 8's approach of ranking based on sorted values might be more stable.\n\nComparing Heuristic 15/18 and Heuristic 20: Heuristic 15/18 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and scales non-exact fits to [0, 0.9] using normalized inverse of space after placement. Heuristic 20 also prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 but scales non-exact fits to [0.5, 0.99] using inverse of normalized excess capacity. The latter scaling and explicit re-assertion of exact fit priority seem slightly more robust.\n\nOverall: More sophisticated heuristics implement a multi-tiered strategy (exact fit, then best fit based on normalized excess/inverse excess) with carefully chosen scaling factors to differentiate priorities. Simple inverse or ratio-based scoring is less effective than tiered approaches.\n- \nHere's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Exact Fit, Minimal Excess Capacity, Scaled Difference, Vectorization.\n*   **Advice:** Explicitly separate exact fits with maximum priority. For close fits, score based on a scaled measure of excess capacity, ensuring these scores are always lower than exact fit scores. Leverage vectorized operations for efficiency.\n*   **Avoid:** Complex non-linear transformations on capacity differences, convoluted array manipulations, and overly aggressive normalization that can obscure relative performance.\n*   **Explanation:** This approach clearly prioritizes perfect solutions while providing a predictable and tunable mechanism for selecting the \"best\" imperfect fit, all within an efficient computational framework.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
