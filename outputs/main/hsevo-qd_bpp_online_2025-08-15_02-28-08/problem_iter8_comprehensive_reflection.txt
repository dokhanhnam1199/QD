Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Interpretability, Vectorization, Hybridization, Simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Focus on direct, well-scaled scoring functions that clearly represent the heuristic's objective. Combine exact matches with robust "close fit" metrics, normalizing differences appropriately. Leverage vectorized operations extensively.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear scoring functions that demand extensive tuning. Unnecessary array manipulations or obscure code that hinders clarity.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritizing interpretable scores and vectorization ensures efficiency and maintainability, while a hybrid approach offers robustness by balancing exact solutions with practical approximations, directly informing heuristic design for better performance and adaptability.
