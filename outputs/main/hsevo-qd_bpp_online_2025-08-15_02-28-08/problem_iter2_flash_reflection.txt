**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1 and 2: These are identical. They implement a "First Fit" strategy that prioritizes bins that can fit the item, with a secondary priority given to bins that offer a "tight fit" to minimize fragmentation. The normalization of "tight fit scores" is a good attempt to make the priorities relative.

Comparing Heuristics 3 and 4: These are identical. They use an "Inverse Distance" (Proximity Fit) approach, prioritizing bins where the remaining capacity is just enough or slightly more than the item. The use of `1 / (space_after_placement + epsilon)` directly rewards smaller positive differences. Setting priority to `-np.inf` for bins that don't fit is a strong negative signal.

Comparing Heuristics 5 and 8: These are identical. They seem to aim for an "Almost Full Fit" by sorting available bins and assigning priorities based on their inverse remaining capacity after placing the item, then re-ranking these priorities. The re-ranking with `np.argsort(np.argsort(...))` is unusual and might be intended to assign ranks based on the sorted inverse capacities.

Comparing Heuristics 6 and 9: These are identical. They implement an "Exact Fit First" heuristic. They give the highest priority to bins where the remaining capacity *exactly* matches the item size. If no exact fit exists, they fall back to prioritizing bins with the least excess capacity (closest to an exact fit) among those that can fit the item. Normalization of scores to [0, 1] is applied in the fallback case.

Comparing Heuristics 7 and the others: Heuristic 7 uses a "Random Fit" description but its implementation is closer to a "Best Fit" variant. It prioritizes bins that can fit the item and assigns priorities based on the inverse of the remaining capacity (after fitting), normalizing these values. This favors bins that will be more full after the item is placed.

Comparing Heuristics 10, 11, and 12: These are identical. They represent a basic "Inverse Fit" strategy. They iterate through bins, assigning a priority of `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)` if the item fits, and 0 otherwise. This is a straightforward approach to favor tighter fits.

Comparing Heuristics 13 through 20: These are all identical and represent a "Sigmoid Fit Score" heuristic. They aim to use a sigmoid function to assign priorities. The current implementation calculates `item / available_caps` as a `fit_quality`, intending to favor bins where the item fills a larger portion of the remaining capacity. A sigmoid is then applied to this `fit_quality` with specific `k` and `threshold` parameters. Bins that cannot fit the item receive a priority of 0.

Overall Comparison:
- **Best:** Heuristics 1 & 2 ("First Fit" with tight fit consideration) and Heuristics 3 & 4 ("Inverse Distance" / Proximity Fit) seem to be well-reasoned strategies for minimizing waste. Heuristics 6 & 9 ("Exact Fit First") are also strong, directly targeting ideal fits.
- **Middle:** Heuristics 10, 11, 12 (basic "Inverse Fit") are simple and effective. Heuristic 7's implementation (normalized inverse capacity) is also reasonable.
- **Lower:** Heuristics 5 & 8's use of `argsort(argsort())` is unclear in its intent and likely suboptimal.
- **Worst:** Heuristics 13-20 ("Sigmoid Fit Score") have a complex, potentially over-engineered approach. The choice of `item / available_caps` and the specific sigmoid parameters (`k=10`, `threshold=0.7`) might not generalize well and could be sensitive to the distribution of item and bin sizes. The description also seems contradictory, mentioning penalizing large wasted space and then favoring bins where the item fills a "significant portion" (which implies less wasted space but also potentially very tight fits).

**Experience:**
Prioritize exact fits and tight fits to minimize fragmentation. Simple inverse relationships with remaining space often perform well. Complex non-linear functions (like sigmoid) require careful tuning and may not generalize. Avoid unusual array manipulations like nested `argsort` without clear justification. Ensure clear intent in docstrings and implementation.
