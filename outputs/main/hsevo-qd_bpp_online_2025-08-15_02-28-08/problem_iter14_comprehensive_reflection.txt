Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Exact fit, scaled closeness, interpretability, robustness, vectorization.
*   **Advice:** Design a multi-tiered scoring system. Assign the highest scores to exact fits. For near-fits, use a scaled inverse of *normalized* excess capacity, ensuring scores decrease monotonically with increasing excess capacity. Keep scoring functions simple and directly tied to fit quality.
*   **Avoid:** Complex, non-monotonic, or highly sensitive non-linear scoring functions. Avoid manual iteration over array elements; leverage vectorization. Do not normalize without a clear rationale, as over-normalization can obscure differences.
*   **Explanation:** This approach balances the strong preference for exact fits with a robust, interpretable method for ranking near-fits, while promoting efficient, maintainable code.
