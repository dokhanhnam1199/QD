{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize exact fits and tight fits to minimize fragmentation. Simple inverse relationships with remaining space often perform well. Complex non-linear functions (like sigmoid) require careful tuning and may not generalize. Avoid unusual array manipulations like nested `argsort` without clear justification. Ensure clear intent in docstrings and implementation.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
