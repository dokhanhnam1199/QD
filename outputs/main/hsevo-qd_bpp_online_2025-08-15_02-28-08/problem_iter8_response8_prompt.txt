The 9th heuristic attempts a similar goal but uses a more complex normalization and weighting scheme (`1.0 + inverted_normalized_tight_fit * 0.1`) which might overcomplicate the priority assignment without a clear performance gain. The 1st heuristic is more direct and likely more effective for its intended purpose.\n\n*   **Heuristics 2nd vs. 4th:** The 2nd heuristic seems to be a duplicate of the 1st heuristic in terms of its core logic (`bins_remain_cap / (diff + epsilon)`). The 4th heuristic (`1.0 / (available_bins_cap + 1e-9)`) and its normalized version gives higher priority to bins with *less* remaining capacity, which is a valid approach for favoring tighter fits. However, the 1st/2nd heuristic's score is `remaining_capacity / (remaining_capacity - item + epsilon)`, which can be interpreted as `(item + diff) / (diff + epsilon)`. This score is inherently higher when `diff` is smaller, effectively favoring tighter fits more strongly and potentially providing a better distinction between bins.\n\n*   **Heuristics 3rd vs. 11th/12th/14th/15th/16th/17th/18th/19th/20th:** These heuristics focus on an \"Exact Fit First\" strategy, which is a good principle.\n    *   Heuristics 3rd, 11th, 12th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th implement a hybrid approach: exact fits get the highest priority (e.g., 1.0 or 2.0), and then other fitting bins are prioritized based on their \"closeness\" (minimal excess capacity).\n    *   The normalization and scaling in these hybrids vary:\n        *   Heuristics 3rd and 11th/12th/14th use a form of `1 / (excess - min_excess + epsilon)` or similar to rank closer fits higher, scaling them to a specific range (e.g., `[0.5, 0.99]` or `[0.1, 0.9]`).\n        *   Heuristics 15th and 16th use `1.0 - normalized_diff + 0.1` which is a decreasing function of normalized difference, and assign a base priority of 2.0 to exact fits.\n        *   Heuristics 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th combine exact fit (priority 1.0) with a normalized proximity score that attempts to stay below 1.0. Heuristic 20th, for example, uses `1.0 / (space_after_placement + 1e-9)` and then ranks these, mapping them to `[0.1, 0.9]`.\n    *   The primary difference between these hybrid heuristics lies in the specific scoring and scaling of \"close fits\" and how strictly they enforce the hierarchy over exact fits. Heuristics 11th/12th/14th have a clear separation by using `[0.5, 0.99]` for close fits and `1.0` for exact fits. Heuristics 15th/16th assign `2.0` to exact fits, which is a stronger hierarchy. Heuristic 1st/2nd's score `bins_remain_cap / (diff + epsilon)` is a more direct approach to prioritizing close fits without explicit exact-fit separation, potentially making it more adaptable if an exact fit isn't always available.\n\n*   **Heuristics 5th vs. 7th:** These appear to be identical to Heuristic 4th, using a normalized inverse of available capacity.\n\n*   **Heuristics 6th:** This heuristic calculates `1.0 / (available_bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)` which is similar to the 1st/2nd heuristic's core idea, but then it applies `np.argsort(np.argsort(...))`. This effectively ranks the bins based on their proximity scores, assigning ranks from 0 to N-1. This means it prioritizes bins with smaller excesses, but the absolute priority values are just ranks, which might be less sensitive to the magnitude of differences compared to direct scores.\n\n*   **Heuristics 9th vs. 13th:** Heuristic 13th is a simple loop-based implementation of `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + 1e-9)` for fitting bins, which is the core logic of the \"inverse difference\" or \"best fit\" strategy. Heuristic 9th attempts a more complex normalization and weighting, which isn't clearly better than the direct inverse difference. Heuristic 13th is simpler but might suffer from non-vectorized operations if the list of bins is very large.\n\n*   **Overall:** The first heuristic (`bins_remain_cap / (diff + epsilon)`) seems to offer a good balance of simplicity and effectiveness by directly prioritizing bins where the remaining capacity is closest to the item size. Hybrid approaches (like 3rd, 11th, 15th) that explicitly handle exact fits first are also strong contenders. The \"normalized inverse remaining capacity\" (4th, 5th, 7th) is a reasonable heuristic for promoting tighter fits but might not distinguish as well between very close fits as the `bins_remain_cap / diff` approach. The ranking-based approach (6th) is also viable but potentially less nuanced.\n- \nHere's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Interpretability, Vectorization, Hybridization, Simplicity.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on direct, well-scaled scoring functions that clearly represent the heuristic's objective. Combine exact matches with robust \"close fit\" metrics, normalizing differences appropriately. Leverage vectorized operations extensively.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear scoring functions that demand extensive tuning. Unnecessary array manipulations or obscure code that hinders clarity.\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritizing interpretable scores and vectorization ensures efficiency and maintainability, while a hybrid approach offers robustness by balancing exact solutions with practical approximations, directly informing heuristic design for better performance and adaptability.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
