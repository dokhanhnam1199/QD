Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Intuitiveness, Measurability, Robustness.
*   **Advice:** Focus on simple, linear or monotonic relationships that directly address core problem objectives. Ensure your heuristic's behavior is easily understood and its impact on key metrics can be directly measured. Prioritize solutions that are less sensitive to parameter tuning and edge cases.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-monotonic, or "black box" logic. Unnecessary algorithmic overhead. Heuristics that require extensive data fitting or are brittle to slight input variations.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are transparent and predictable. By favoring straightforward logic and clear objectives, you create more robust and maintainable solutions that are easier to debug and improve over time, ultimately leading to better optimization outcomes.
