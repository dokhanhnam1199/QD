Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Exact Fit, Minimal Excess Capacity, Scaled Difference, Vectorization.
*   **Advice:** Explicitly separate exact fits with maximum priority. For close fits, score based on a scaled measure of excess capacity, ensuring these scores are always lower than exact fit scores. Leverage vectorized operations for efficiency.
*   **Avoid:** Complex non-linear transformations on capacity differences, convoluted array manipulations, and overly aggressive normalization that can obscure relative performance.
*   **Explanation:** This approach clearly prioritizes perfect solutions while providing a predictable and tunable mechanism for selecting the "best" imperfect fit, all within an efficient computational framework.
