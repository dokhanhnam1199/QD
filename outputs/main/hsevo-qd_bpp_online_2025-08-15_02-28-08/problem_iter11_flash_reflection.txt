**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Best) and Heuristic 5 (also the same as 1): Both use `bins_remain_cap / (diff + epsilon)` to prioritize tight fits, favoring bins where `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item`.

Comparing Heuristic 2 and Heuristic 4: Both are identical to Heuristic 1, essentially repeating the same logic. The extensive commented-out exploration in Heuristic 2 doesn't translate to a distinct improvement or change in the final implemented logic compared to Heuristic 1.

Comparing Heuristic 3 and Heuristic 12/13/14: Heuristic 3 uses `bins_remain_cap / (diff + epsilon)`, similar to Heuristic 1. Heuristics 12, 13, and 14 introduce a tiered approach: highest priority for exact fits (score 2.0), and medium priority for non-exact fits based on normalized differences (scaled to be less than 2.0, e.g., `1.0 - normalized_diff + 0.1`). This tiered approach is more sophisticated than a single scoring function.

Comparing Heuristic 6 and Heuristic 7: Heuristic 6 uses a two-tier system: 1.0 for exact fits, and then normalized scores (0.0-0.9) for non-exact fits based on inverse of excess capacity relative to the minimum excess. Heuristic 7 is similar but assigns 2.0 to exact fits and scales non-exact fits to [0.1, 1.0]. The normalization in Heuristic 7 might be more robust if the range of excess capacities is large.

Comparing Heuristic 10/11 and Heuristic 16/17/19: Heuristics 10, 11 use a fixed priority of 1.0 for exact fits and scale non-exact fits to a range [0.5, 0.99] based on inverse normalized excess. Heuristics 16, 17, 19 also give 1.0 to exact fits but scale non-exact fits to a range like [0.1, 0.9] using inverse excess capacity relative to the maximum inverse excess capacity. The scaling in 16/17/19 seems more nuanced for ranking close fits.

Comparing Heuristic 8 and Heuristic 9: Heuristic 8 sorts available bins by remaining capacity and then assigns ranks based on sorted priorities (which appears to be a form of inverse remaining capacity). Heuristic 9 directly uses the inverse of available capacity (not excess capacity) and normalizes it. Heuristic 8's approach of ranking based on sorted values might be more stable.

Comparing Heuristic 15/18 and Heuristic 20: Heuristic 15/18 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and scales non-exact fits to [0, 0.9] using normalized inverse of space after placement. Heuristic 20 also prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 but scales non-exact fits to [0.5, 0.99] using inverse of normalized excess capacity. The latter scaling and explicit re-assertion of exact fit priority seem slightly more robust.

Overall: More sophisticated heuristics implement a multi-tiered strategy (exact fit, then best fit based on normalized excess/inverse excess) with carefully chosen scaling factors to differentiate priorities. Simple inverse or ratio-based scoring is less effective than tiered approaches.

**Experience:**
Prioritize exact fits with the highest score. For non-exact fits, use inverse of normalized excess capacity, scaling to differentiate ranks while keeping them below exact fit scores. Robust normalization is key for handling diverse capacity ranges.
