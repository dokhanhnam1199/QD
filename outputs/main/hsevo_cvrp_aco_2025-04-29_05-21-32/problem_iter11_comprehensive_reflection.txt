- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics. We need to move beyond just listing techniques and focus on *why* and *how* to apply them effectively.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, problem-specific knowledge, iterative refinement, evaluation metrics, trade-off analysis.
*   **Advice:** Frame heuristic design as an iterative learning process driven by problem-specific insights and performance evaluation. Focus on understanding the underlying problem structure.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly adding features or tuning weights without a clear rationale. Avoid complexity without demonstrated performance improvement.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply stating techniques, emphasize adapting heuristic components based on *observed* performance and a deep understanding of the problem's characteristics.
