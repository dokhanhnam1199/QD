**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic uses depot proximity with adaptive pruning, angle from depot, and sparsification based on the mean of heuristic values, while the bottom heuristic relies on inverse distance, demand consideration, depot proximity, k-NN, and sparsification using a quantile-based threshold. The top heuristic also focuses on pruning infeasible edges related to capacity early on.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), the second-best also contains depot proximity, angle from depot, and sparsification but lacks the explicit adaptive pruning based on capacity constraints. The second-worst only calculates demand penalty instead of hard pruning edges.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the top heuristic includes stronger depot connection boosts and considers a normalized angle reward, while the second heuristic omits the route completion incentive.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd and 4th heuristic are similar, but the 4th heuristic incorporates route completion incentives, stronger depot connection boosts, and a more sophisticated sparsification approach based on combined distance and demand. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both functions are virtually identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more nuanced adaptive sparsification techniques (based on means and combined metrics), depot proximity and angle considerations and prioritize pruning infeasible edges.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, focus on incorporating adaptive pruning based on problem-specific constraints like capacity. Consider combinations of factors such as distance, demand, and angles to derive more informed edge selection probabilities. Use normalization for stability.
