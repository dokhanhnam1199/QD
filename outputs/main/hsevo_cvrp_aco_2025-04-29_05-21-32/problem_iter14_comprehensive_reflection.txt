- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics, aiming to avoid pitfalls and focusing on actionable insights.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive parameters, incremental refinement, problem-specific constraints, normalization, k-NN intensification, sparsification.

*   **Advice:** Begin with simple components, progressively integrate adaptive mechanisms (k-NN, sparsification), and normalize intermediate results. Focus on problem constraints to drive adaptation.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex formulas, fixed parameters, neglecting problem-specific constraints, relying solely on intuition, and premature optimization.

*   **Explanation:** Start simple, *adapt* to the *problem*, and control scaling through normalization. Let problem constraints *guide* heuristic refinement, not complicate it.
