    """
    Heuristics function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.
    This version incorporates demand, distance, depot proximity, angle considerations, k-NN intensification,
    and adaptive sparsification with refined weight tuning and depot-specific adjustments.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (shape: n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands.
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n x n).
