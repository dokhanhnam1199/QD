- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable steps and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, factor incorporation, normalization, simplicity, adaptability.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a clear, basic heuristic. Systematically add factors (demand, depot proximity, etc.) one at a time, evaluating the impact of each addition on performance.

*   **Avoid:** Over-engineered formulas, premature optimization, overly specific parameters, complex interactions without empirical justification.

*   **Explanation:** Emphasize incremental improvements and data-driven decisions. Simple, adaptable heuristics are easier to understand, debug, and modify, ultimately leading to more robust solutions.
