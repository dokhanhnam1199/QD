**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic utilizes a combination of inverse distance, demand considerations (with depot-specific adjustments), depot proximity, k-nearest neighbors, and sparsification, followed by normalization. The 20th heuristic uses a similar approach but lacks specific scaling factors for depot departures based on remaining capacity and uses hardcoded boosts.
(2nd best) vs (second worst): (2nd) uses a weighted combination of distance, demand, and depot proximity. (19th) uses inverse distance, demand factor adjusted for depot location, depot proximity factor, k-nearest neighbors, and sparsification. The primary difference lies in the explicit inclusion of k-NN and sparsification in (1st) which seems to be essential for better performance.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) employs a more complex and refined approach by integrating k-NN bonus, a more aggressive sparsification based on a dynamic threshold, and specific boost from the depot alongside normalization, whereas (2nd) relies on a simpler, weighted combination of distance, demand, and depot proximity. The sophisticated tuning and edge pruning in (1st) likely contribute to its superior performance.
(3rd) vs (4th): Both implementations are nearly identical, meaning there's little to differentiate between them in terms of design.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see a similar approach that considers inverse distance, demand and depot proximity, but weights them differently and does not include k-NN or sparsification. The normalization step remains consistent. Overall, the lack of k-NN and sparsification leads to decreased performance.

Overall: The best heuristics in the list combine several factors: inverse distance as a base, demand considerations with capacity constraints, depot proximity encouragements, k-nearest neighbor bonuses, and sparsification to prune unpromising edges. The key to better performance involves fine-tuning the weights and thresholds of these components and incorporating more problem-specific information to make better routing decisions. The weaker heuristics often lack the k-NN and sparsification components and have less refined scaling for different factors. Normalization appears to be a standard practice.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with basic components (distance, demand). Gradually add more sophisticated elements like k-NN to intensify the search around promising areas, sparsification to cut off unlikely edges, and depot-specific adjustments to route construction. Tuning weights is crucial.
