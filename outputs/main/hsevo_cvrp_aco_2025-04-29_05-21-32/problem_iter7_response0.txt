    """
    Heuristics function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.
    This version incorporates demand, distance, depot proximity and angle considerations with adaptive sparsification and simplified components.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (shape: n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (shape: n).
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.
        depot_boost_weight (float): Weight for boosting edges from the depot. Default is 0.3.
        detour_penalty_weight (float): Weight for penalizing detours from the direct depot route. Default is 0.05.
        demand_capacity_threshold (float): Threshold for pruning based on demand and capacity. Default is 1/3.
        angle_reward_weight (float): Weight for rewarding edges with similar angles from the depot. Default is 0.1.
        sparsification_threshold_factor (float): Factor for determining the sparsification threshold. Default is 0.01.
        inverse_distance_epsilon (float): Epsilon value to avoid division by zero in inverse distance calculation. Default is 1e-9.
        mean_depot_distance_epsilon (float): Epsilon value to avoid division by zero when calculating detour penalty. Default is 1e-9.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n x n).
