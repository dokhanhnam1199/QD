**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st heuristic focuses on simplicity, using inverse distance modified by demand and depot proximity, while the 2nd incorporates the Clarke-Wright savings algorithm and coordinate distances. The 2nd also normalizes savings. Overall, the 1st heuristics seems to be more straightforward.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see heuristic 2nd includes savings calculations from Clarke-Wright and also coordinate distance. The 19th makes use of angle and capacity slack. These factors might be too specific or not generally effective, potentially overfitting to certain problem instances. Heuristic 2nd normalizes savings by dividing by `np.max(savings_matrix)`. This appears to be important.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), we see that they are different.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd is identical to the 2nd, but the 4th uses weights for distance, demand, and depot proximity, also using exponential functions for demand and proximity. The use of tunable weights may not be enough.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), 19th vs 20th is identical. Perhaps it wasn't possible to improve on the bad designs.

Overall: The better heuristics generally balance simplicity with relevant factors (distance, demand, depot proximity) without over-engineering. Normalization is important. Angular considerations, while intuitive, may not always improve performance. Overly complex combinations of factors can also hinder performance.

**Experience:**
Start with a simple, intuitive heuristic (e.g., inverse distance). Gradually incorporate additional factors like demand and depot proximity. Use normalization techniques and avoid over-complex combinations or excessively specific calculations (e.g., Clarke-Wright savings, complex angular penalties). Weights may not be helpful.
