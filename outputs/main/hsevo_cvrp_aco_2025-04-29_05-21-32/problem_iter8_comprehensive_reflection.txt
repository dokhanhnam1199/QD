- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection" (which is currently empty, implying all current reflections are potentially valuable). Here's a redefinition:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive pruning, problem constraints, factor combinations (distance, demand, angles), normalization, iterative refinement, k-NN intensification, sparsification, depot-specific adjustments, weight tuning.
*   **Advice:** Begin with simple, intuitive heuristics. Incrementally add sophistication (k-NN, sparsification, depot adjustments) while prioritizing weight tuning for parameter control and balance.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex combinations or excessively specific calculations early on. Prematurely dismissing the value of weight optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Start simple, normalize to stabilize, adapt based on problem constraints, tune weights to balance factors, and iteratively improve the heuristic's components.
