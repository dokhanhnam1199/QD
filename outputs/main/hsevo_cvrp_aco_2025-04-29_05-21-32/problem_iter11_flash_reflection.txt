**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates inverse distance, demand/capacity considerations, depot proximity with adaptive pruning and k-NN, angle from depot, and sparsification, while the worst uses only inverse distance, demand-aware pruning, depot proximity, and sparsification. (2nd) vs (19th) shows k-NN dropped. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) shows the more complex logic with different weighting and aggressive sparsification helps. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst included K-NN while the worst does not. Overall: Better heuristics tend to incorporate more features (distance, demand, depot proximity, angles), adaptive pruning/sparsification, and intensification techniques (k-NN). They also carefully manage edge cases and normalize the heuristic values. Simpler heuristics are often outperformed by more complex, well-tuned ones.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with basic components and incrementally add more features. Adaptive parameters and careful weight tuning are crucial. Consider techniques like k-NN for intensification and sparsification for efficiency. Normalizing the output ensures consistent scaling.
