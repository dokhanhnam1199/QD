{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with basic components (distance, demand). Gradually add more sophisticated elements like k-NN to intensify the search around promising areas, sparsification to cut off unlikely edges, and depot-specific adjustments to route construction. Tuning weights is crucial.\nStart with a simple, intuitive heuristic (e.g., inverse distance). Gradually incorporate additional factors like demand and depot proximity. Use normalization techniques and avoid over-complex combinations or excessively specific calculations (e.g., Clarke-Wright savings, complex angular penalties). Weights may not be helpful.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
