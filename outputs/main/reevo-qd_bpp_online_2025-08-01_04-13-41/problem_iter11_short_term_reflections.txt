Filter invalid choices. Implement strategic fit rules. Add bonuses for ideal outcomes like perfect fits.
Filter invalid choices. Prioritize options leading to high resource utilization, especially perfect fits.
Heuristics must leverage problem-specific information and optimize for a clear objective, like minimizing waste.
Ensure feasibility. Prioritize tight fits; strongly reward perfect packing.
Prioritize optimal immediate fits, and intelligently penalize choices creating problematic future bin states.
Prioritize choices that minimize waste and penalize infeasible options for better bin utilization.
Beyond immediate fit, consider future bin utility to avoid difficult-to-fill gaps.
Design heuristics that strategically evaluate bin remaining capacity for tight fits, avoiding non-fitting bins.
Strategically evaluate bin state: minimize waste, reward perfect fits, penalize awkward small gaps.
Prioritize tight fits, minimize remaining capacity, and filter infeasible options.
