Evaluate placement impact; prioritize options minimizing future waste and filtering invalid choices.
Prioritize choices that minimize wasted space or optimize resource utilization.
Prioritize tight fits to minimize wasted space. Consider item size when selecting bins.
Leverage item and bin states to minimize *relative* waste. Define clear objective functions for strategic packing decisions.
Utilize problem-specific context (item size, bin state) to minimize relative waste, aiming for compact fits.
Utilize problem context (item, capacities) to calculate relevant metrics for informed, waste-minimizing decisions.
Utilize item and bin properties to minimize remaining bin capacity, optimizing bin utilization.
Consider remaining capacity. Prioritize bins that lead to a tighter fit, excluding overflows.
Utilize problem state (item/bin sizes) to minimize waste and find best-fit opportunities.
Heuristics must strategically optimize for efficiency, e.g., minimizing waste or maximizing utilization.
