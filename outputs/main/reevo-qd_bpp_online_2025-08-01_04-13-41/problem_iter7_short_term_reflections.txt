Prioritize bins for tight fits, minimizing remaining waste after item placement.
Validate choices. Optimize locally (e.g., Best Fit). Strategically reward ideal outcomes (e.g., perfect fits).
Prioritize tight fits. Penalize awkward remaining capacities to minimize future waste and improve long-term packing efficiency.
Prioritize valid fits. Implement greedy choice (Best Fit). Add bonuses for ideal outcomes like perfect fits.
Prioritize best fit to current item, but penalize outcomes that create awkward future gaps.
Leverage problem structure for informed, greedy, waste-minimizing choices.
Utilize item and bin state for informed decisions; prioritize snug relative fits to minimize waste.
Leverage bin capacities. Best-Fit minimizes remaining space, improving packing density for better utilization.
Evaluate item-bin fit. Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space for better packing.
Prioritize tight fits (minimal remaining capacity). Leverage item and bin sizes to avoid arbitrary placement.
