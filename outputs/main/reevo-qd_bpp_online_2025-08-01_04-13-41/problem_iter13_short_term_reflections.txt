Incorporate item and bin state to minimize waste; avoid arbitrary choices.
Prioritize tight fits to minimize wasted space, improving bin utilization. Use item and bin data strategically.
Evaluate choices based on their impact, filter infeasible options, and incentivize optimal local solutions.
Strategically minimize waste, maximize perfect fits, and avoid awkward, hard-to-fill leftover gaps.
Optimize for future bin utility: prioritize perfect fits and avoid awkward, hard-to-fill gaps.
Dynamically use item/bin state to calculate priorities, minimizing relative waste for snug fits.
Minimize remaining capacity. Reward perfect fits. Penalize small, awkward gaps for long-term efficiency.
Incorporate item-bin fit. Reward perfect matches and penalize awkward remaining spaces for better utilization.
Prioritize immediate fit, reward perfect fills, and penalize "awkward" remaining capacities to optimize long-term utilization.
Design priorities to minimize fragmentation and maximize bin utilization by using problem-specific data.
