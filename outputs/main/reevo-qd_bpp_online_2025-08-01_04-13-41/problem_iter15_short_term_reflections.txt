Use problem state to filter and rank choices; add strategic bonuses for optimal outcomes.
Utilize specific heuristics (e.g., Best Fit) to minimize waste, considering item/bin properties, with deterministic tie-breaking.
Minimize immediate waste; strategically reward perfect fits, penalize awkward small gaps using domain knowledge.
Prioritize tight fits. Penalize creating awkward gaps to minimize future waste and improve long-term bin utility.
Reward perfect fits, penalize awkward gaps, and prioritize minimal waste for better long-term bin utilization.
Filter invalid options. Reward optimal fits. Minimize remaining capacity for other choices.
Strategically prioritize: minimize waste, reward perfect fits, avoid awkward gaps for better utilization.
Prioritize tight fits, reward perfect packing, and penalize awkward remaining gaps for better long-term utilization.
Evaluate item-bin fit quality: prioritize minimal remaining space and perfect fits.
Reward perfect fits, penalize awkward gaps, and optimize for future bin utility.
