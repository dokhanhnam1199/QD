    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements a "Best Fit" strategy, augmented to
    evaluate the 'impact' of the placement by applying a penalty if
    the placement would result in a "medium" amount of remaining capacity
    in the bin. This aims to minimize future waste by discouraging
    the creation of awkwardly sized gaps that might be difficult to fill.
    It prioritizes bins that would be nearly full (very small remainder)
    or those that would still have a large remaining capacity after the item
    is placed.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        The bin with the highest score (least negative) will be selected.

    # In standard Bin Packing Problems, the bin capacity is fixed and known.

    # for normalized problems, or infer it from the initial state if an empty bin
    # (with full capacity) is guaranteed to be in bins_remain_cap.
    # For a general solution, assuming 1.0 (typical for normalized problems) is reasonable.
    # If item sizes are integers, BIN_CAPACITY would be an integer as well (e.g., 100).
    BIN_CAPACITY = 1.0 # This should ideally be passed as an argument or global constant.
                       # For demonstration, assuming a normalized bin capacity of 1.0.

    # Calculate the remaining capacity if the item were placed in each bin.

    # This part penalizes scenarios where placing the item leaves a 'medium' amount
    # of remaining capacity. Such gaps can be considered "waste" because they are

    penalty_value = item * 2.0  # Example: 2 times the item size as penalty.
                                 # This ensures the penalty scales with item magnitudes.
