Utilize item and bin sizes to intelligently minimize wasted space and prioritize tighter fits.
Leverage problem state to make informed decisions; prioritize snug fits to minimize waste.
Utilize item and bin state to strategically prioritize fits, minimizing wasted space for efficiency.
Evaluate and prioritize bin choices based on item fit/utilization, avoiding arbitrary selections.
Evaluate item-bin interaction: prioritize tighter fits and exclude impossible placements.
Leverage all available data. Define a clear strategic objective (e.g., Best-Fit) to intelligently prioritize bin choices, minimizing waste.
Define priority based on problem-specific metrics, like resulting remaining capacity or best fit, not arbitrary values.
Prioritize choices based on predicted outcomes, favoring those that minimize waste or maximize utilization.
Actively use item and bin data to prioritize feasible fits and minimize remaining space for better packing.
Define clear local objectives. Use problem data to score choices, minimizing immediate waste or maximizing fit.
