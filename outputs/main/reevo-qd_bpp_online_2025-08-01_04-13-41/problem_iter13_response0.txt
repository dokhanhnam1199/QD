    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function refines the Best Fit heuristic by explicitly rewarding perfect fits
    and prioritizing snug, immediate fits. It addresses the "Prior reflection" points:
    1.  Filter invalid: Bins where the item does not fit are assigned an extremely low priority.
    2.  Reward perfect fits: Bins that result in zero remaining capacity are given a very high priority bonus.
    3.  Prioritize snug, immediate ones: For non-perfect fits, bins leaving the smallest positive
        remaining capacity are preferred (standard Best Fit).
    4.  Penalize awkward future gaps: Implicitly addressed by strongly preferring perfect fits
        (which eliminate awkward fragmentation for that bin) and minimizing remaining waste otherwise.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        The bin with the highest score will be selected.
