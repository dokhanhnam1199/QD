Filter invalid bins. Minimize remaining capacity. Strategically reward perfect fits.
Design heuristics to strategically minimize waste by fitting items tightly.
Filter invalid options. Prioritize choices that minimize waste and maximize utilization, especially perfect fits.
Incorporate item size and bin capacities to prioritize minimizing relative waste or fragmentation.
Leverage item and bin properties to minimize waste and optimize future bin utilization.
Prioritize choices that minimize remaining bin capacity, maximizing utilization and reducing waste.
Leverage item size and bin capacity to minimize fractional waste.
Prioritize strategic bin selection: Use "Best Fit", augmented by penalizing awkward remaining spaces for future efficiency.
Heuristics must leverage item and bin states to minimize relative waste through snug fits.
Evaluate post-placement bin states: minimize waste, reward perfect fits, penalize awkward gaps. Tune weights.
