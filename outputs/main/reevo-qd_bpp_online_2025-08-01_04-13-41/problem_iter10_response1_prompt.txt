BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Bins where the item does not fit are given an extremely low priority.\n    2. For bins where the item fits, priority is inversely proportional to the\n       remaining capacity after placement, meaning smaller remaining capacity\n       yields higher priority (Best Fit principle). This maps priorities for\n       non-perfect fits to a range between 0 (for very large remaining capacity)\n       and 1 (for remaining capacity approaching zero).\n    3.
