Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following \"heuristics\". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution.

Overall: The better heuristics seem to prioritize sparsification based on percentile thresholds, combined with normalization. Adaptive degree penalties, especially when applied to nodes with significantly above-average degrees, also appear beneficial. Adding randomness can be helpful, but it should be controlled and applied judiciously. The shortest path calculation using Dijkstra is consistently present in the better heuristics.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's refine that reflection to design better heuristics, focusing on effectiveness and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Penalties, Multi-Source Information, Controlled Stochasticity, Post-Normalization\n*   **Advice:** Fuse node characteristics (degree) with network structure (shortest paths, distance) adaptively. Experiment with different combination functions (e.g., weighted sums, multiplicative models). Control randomness via temperature parameters.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature normalization, static penalties, isolated component design.\n*   **Explanation:** Combine node-level features and path information. Adaptive penalties based on evolving network state better manage exploration. Combine and *then* normalize to preserve component influence.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `heuristics_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
