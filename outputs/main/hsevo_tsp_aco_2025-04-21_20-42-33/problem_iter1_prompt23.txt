Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following \"heuristics\". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.\n\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    return 1 / distance_matrix\n\n\nRefer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `heuristics_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\n"}
