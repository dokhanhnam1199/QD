- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I will help you redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls and focusing on effective strategies. Here's a breakdown to guide the process:

*   **Keywords:** Informed Exploration, Node Degree Penalty, Inverse Distance, Shortest Path Integration, Controlled Randomness, Solution Balancing.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize shortest path information and inverse distance metrics, then gently bias exploration by penalizing high-degree node connections only when necessary. Use randomization sparingly, guided by the quality of the existing solution.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly penalizing high-degree nodes, uncontrolled or excessive randomness, neglecting shortest path information and solution balance.

*   **Explanation:** Combining these factors ensures the heuristic balances exploration with exploitation of good solutions, leverages distance and path information, and avoids getting stuck in local optima due to over-penalization or excessive randomness.
