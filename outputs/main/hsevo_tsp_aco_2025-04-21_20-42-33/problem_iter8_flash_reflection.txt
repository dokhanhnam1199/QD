**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first heuristic uses sparsification with a fixed percentile (20), while the second uses a higher percentile (75) and adds controlled randomness. The first one performs sparsification before normalization while the second performs sparsification after normalization.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the third heuristic introduces stochasticity based on heuristic values (higher heuristic -> lower temperature) and uses a more aggressive sparsification (30th percentile).  The second heuristic adds randomness with a fixed temperature. The third heuristic makes the temperature adaptive.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the fourth heuristic only applies the degree penalty if the degree is above the average and adds a small amount of randomness, ensuring non-zero values. The third heuristic applies a degree penalty regardless of being above average and applies a stochastic temperature scaled by heuristic value.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), the fifth heuristic reduces the penalty applied to nodes with above-average degrees.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), they are identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (17th), the adaptive degree penalty in (17th) applies penalty only when both nodes have row sums greater than the mean while first heuristic always applies a degree penalty.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), The adaptive node degree penalty in 17th simply divides the heuristic matrix. In 16th, a pheromone inspired component is incorporated as a weighted sum.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (20th), (1st) applies adaptive degree bias via geometric means, and sparsifies via percentile, whereas 20th uses weighted sum with degree penalty and a "node potential" term.

Overall: The better heuristics tend to combine inverse distance with shortest paths and adaptive degree biases. Sparsification, controlled randomness, and normalization are also important. Adaptive temperature based on heuristic value and using geometric mean seems to perform better than using constant temperature or weighted sums. Penalizing high-degree nodes, encouraging exploration, and using node potential can further improve the heuristic. Applying sparsification earlier seems beneficial.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for TSP benefit from combining multiple factors (distance, shortest paths, degree). Adaptive penalties and temperature control based on the current heuristic values can improve performance. Sparsification should be applied earlier. Different combinations can lead to good results.
