- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a refined view of self-reflection for designing better TSP heuristics, focusing on actionability and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Component importance, adaptive penalties, sparsification timing, controlled randomness.

*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each component (distance, degree, shortest path) during heuristic construction. Track their influence on solution quality to guide adaptive parameter adjustments.

*   **Avoid:** Premature commitment to fixed parameter settings. Avoid overly complex, untestable combinations of components initially.

*   **Explanation:** Continuous monitoring and evaluation are crucial. Instead of assuming a combination works, measure its effect.
