**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see (1st) includes sparsification based on a percentile threshold and normalization, while (20th) adds randomness after the core heuristic calculation, and sparsifies based on an absolute threshold;
(2nd best) vs (second worst), both have similar structures but (2nd) includes Dijkstra for shortest paths and focuses on inverse distance, and (19th) calculates edge centrality and applies randomness; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they appear identical; (3rd) vs (4th), (3rd) calculates degree differently using a loop, while (4th) incorporates controlled randomness and adjusts the degree penalty; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the degree penalty calculation is different, and (19th) incorporates shortest paths using Floyd-Warshall, whereas (20th) focuses on the inverse distance. Overall: The better heuristics seem to prioritize sparsification based on percentile thresholds, combined with normalization. Adaptive degree penalties, especially when applied to nodes with significantly above-average degrees, also appear beneficial. Adding randomness can be helpful, but it should be controlled and applied judiciously. The shortest path calculation using Dijkstra is consistently present in the better heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize core components like inverse distance and shortest paths using Dijkstra. Implement an adaptive degree penalty focused on high-degree nodes, and consider sparsification based on percentile thresholds. Controlled randomness can be added, but with careful consideration. Normalization should be done after combining the heuristic components.
