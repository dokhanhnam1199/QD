{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with fundamental components like inverse distance and shortest paths. Adaptively adjust penalties based on node degree. Sparsify to focus on the most promising edges and normalize to maintain consistent scaling. Introduce randomness judiciously to balance exploration and exploitation. Experiment to find best combination startegies.\nEffective heuristics should combine inverse distance with node degree and some measure of shortest paths. Penalizing connections between high-degree nodes encourages exploration and balances the solution. Randomness can be included, but should be carefully controlled and combined with informed exploration strategies.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize core components like inverse distance and shortest paths using Dijkstra. Implement an adaptive degree penalty focused on high-degree nodes, and consider sparsification based on percentile thresholds. Controlled randomness can be added, but with careful consideration. Normalization should be done after combining the heuristic components.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for TSP benefit from combining multiple factors (distance, shortest paths, degree). Adaptive penalties and temperature control based on the current heuristic values can improve performance. Sparsification should be applied earlier. Different combinations can lead to good results.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
