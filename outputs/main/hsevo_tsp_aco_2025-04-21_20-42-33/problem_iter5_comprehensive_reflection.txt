- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine that reflection to design better heuristics, focusing on effectiveness and avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Penalties, Multi-Source Information, Controlled Stochasticity, Post-Normalization
*   **Advice:** Fuse node characteristics (degree) with network structure (shortest paths, distance) adaptively. Experiment with different combination functions (e.g., weighted sums, multiplicative models). Control randomness via temperature parameters.
*   **Avoid:** Premature normalization, static penalties, isolated component design.
*   **Explanation:** Combine node-level features and path information. Adaptive penalties based on evolving network state better manage exploration. Combine and *then* normalize to preserve component influence.
