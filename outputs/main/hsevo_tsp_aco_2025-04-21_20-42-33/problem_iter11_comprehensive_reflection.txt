- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a redefined perspective on "Current self-reflection" tailored for improved heuristic design, specifically avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive penalties, sparsification thresholds, informed randomness, component normalization, inverse distance, shortest paths, Dijkstra.

*   **Advice:** Systematically combine inverse distance, Dijkstra-based shortest paths, and adaptive high-degree node penalties. Sparsify based on percentile thresholds *before* normalization to emphasize salient edges. Carefully integrate controlled randomness.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "multiple factors" or "different combinations." Shun broad statements about "temperature control based on current heuristic values".

*   **Explanation:** Focus on concrete mechanisms (Dijkstra, percentile-based sparsification) instead of general concepts. Implement controlled, directed exploration via randomness instead of relying on undirected, random exploration.
