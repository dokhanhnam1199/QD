Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following \"heuristics\". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"TSP heuristic: Combines inverse distance, adaptive degree bias, and shortest paths with sparsification.\"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Inverse distance\n    inverse_distance = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-9)\n\n    # Shortest path estimate (Dijkstra)\n    graph = scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(distance_matrix)\n    shortest_paths = dijkstra(graph, directed=False, indices=range(n))\n\n    # Adaptive degree bias\n    degree_penalty = np.ones((n, n))\n    degrees = np.sum(inverse_distance, axis=1)\n    avg_degree = np.mean(degrees)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                penalty_i = max(1, avg_degree / (degrees[i] + 1e-9))\n                penalty_j = max(1, avg_degree / (degrees[j] + 1e-9))\n                degree_penalty[i, j] = penalty_i * penalty_j\n            else:\n                degree_penalty[i, j] = 0\n\n    # Combine heuristics\n    heuristic_matrix = inverse_distance * degree_penalty / (shortest_paths + 1e-9)\n\n    # Sparsification\n    threshold = np.percentile(heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix > 0], 20)\n    heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < threshold] = 0\n\n    # Normalize\n    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristic_matrix)\n    if max_heuristic > 0:\n        heuristic_matrix /= max_heuristic\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `heuristics_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, here's a refined view of self-reflection for designing better TSP heuristics, focusing on actionability and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Component importance, adaptive penalties, sparsification timing, controlled randomness.\n\n*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each component (distance, degree, shortest path) during heuristic construction. Track their influence on solution quality to guide adaptive parameter adjustments.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature commitment to fixed parameter settings. Avoid overly complex, untestable combinations of components initially.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Continuous monitoring and evaluation are crucial. Instead of assuming a combination works, measure its effect.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
