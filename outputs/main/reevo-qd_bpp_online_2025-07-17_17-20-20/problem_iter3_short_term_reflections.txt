Focus on feasibility first, then prioritize smaller remainders, avoid overfilling, and balance fullness.

Explicitly minimize waste, strongly prioritize near-full bins, and penalize infeasibility. Add randomness for exploration.

Waste minimization, almost-full bonuses, infeasibility penalties, and tie-breaking randomness are key improvements.

Prioritize fullness, discourage large waste, and penalize infeasible solutions strongly for online bin packing.

The better code uses inverse slack and normalized remaining capacity, providing nuanced bin prioritization and penalization.

Focus on minimizing waste, filling bins, avoiding fragmentation, and adding randomness for exploration.

Explicitly minimizing waste and rewarding near-full bins, instead of implicit penalties/bonuses, improves performance.

Prioritize snug fits (FFD), normalized remaining capacity, and harshly penalize bins that cannot fit.

Prioritize fullness *and* minimize waste. Dynamically adjust priorities based on remaining capacity and waste thresholds.

Prioritize snug fits and penalize waste. Normalize remaining capacity and reward balance.
