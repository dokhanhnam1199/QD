Focus on fit tightness and moderate remaining capacity. Avoid complex combinations and harsh infeasibility penalties.

The better code prioritizes feasible bins, utilizes remaining capacity normalization, and balances rewards/penalties with randomness.

Feasibility, snug fits, balance, and perfect fit bonuses improve bin packing heuristics.

The better code uses bin capacity slack, normalized remaining capacity, and hard constraints (cannot fit) for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility, snug fits, balance, and perfect fits. Avoid direct ratio comparisons; consider normalization.

Prioritize snug fits, penalize infeasibility, and consider normalized remaining capacity with balanced incentives.

The improved heuristic prioritizes feasible bins, minimizes waste, favors tight fits, and adds exploration.

Prioritize feasibility, snug fits, balanced fill, and perfect fits. Avoid direct ratio calculations.

Focus on tight fits and balanced bin utilization. Avoid excessive penalties and normalizations that obscure true fit.

Focus on simple, direct reward/penalty based on slack, and target half-full bins. Avoid complex combinations.
