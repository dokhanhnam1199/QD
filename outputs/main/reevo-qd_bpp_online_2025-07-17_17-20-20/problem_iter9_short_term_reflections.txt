Prioritize feasibility, snug fits, balance, and perfect fits with adaptive bonuses. Penalize waste effectively.

Prioritize snug fits and balance, penalize waste, and strongly reward perfect fits.

Focus on snug fits, penalize waste, reward balanced fill, and significantly reward perfect/almost-full bins.

Prioritize feasible, snug fits, balanced fill, and near-full bins with bonuses. Exploit perfect fits heavily.

Gaussian balance bonus, larger perfect fit bonus, and encouraging almost-full bins improve bin packing.

Reduce "almost full" bonus aggressiveness and add slight randomness to break ties for improved exploration.

Prioritize perfect/snug fits, reward balanced remaining capacity, and incentivize near-full bins more strongly.

Subtle changes matter: Reduce "almost full" bonus, and add randomness to break ties.

The better code adds slight randomness and reduces the "almost full" bonus, improving exploration and balance.

Gaussian balance bonus, larger perfect fit bonus, and "almost full" bin encouragement improve performance.
