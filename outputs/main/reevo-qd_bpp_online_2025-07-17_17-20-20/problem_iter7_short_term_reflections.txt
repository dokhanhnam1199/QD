Feasibility checks, snug fit rewards, capacity normalization, and randomness improve heuristic performance.

Prioritize feasibility, snug fits, moderate remaining capacity, and add randomness for exploration.

Prioritize snug fits, reward balanced fill, and provide significant bonuses for perfect fits to improve bin packing.

Focus on tighter fits (FFD), balance bin utilization, and avoid infeasible placements.

Prioritize feasibility, snug fits, balance, and perfect/almost full bin utilization with tuned bonuses.

Prioritize snug fits, reward balanced fill, and provide bonuses for perfect or near-full fits.

Prioritize snug fits, balance remaining capacity, and reward perfect fits for improved bin packing.

Prioritize feasible bins. Reward near-full bins, penalize waste, and consider inverse slack with added randomness.

Prioritize snug fits, balance remaining capacity, and reward perfect fits. Waste minimization is key.

Focus on slack, avoid excessive normalization/penalties, and encourage bins near half-full for better packing.
