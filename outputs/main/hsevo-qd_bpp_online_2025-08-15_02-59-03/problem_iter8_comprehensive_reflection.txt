Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Robustness, Interpretability, Explicit Penalties, Logical Hierarchy.
*   **Advice:** Focus on intuitive, rule-based strategies. Define a clear, prioritized sequence of simple objectives. Implement explicit checks and penalties for invalid or suboptimal choices.
*   **Avoid:** Complex, opaque mathematical functions without empirical validation. Arbitrary weighting or blending of criteria. Mimicking sequential logic through static scores.
*   **Explanation:** Simpler heuristics are easier to debug, adapt, and understand, leading to more reliable performance across diverse problem instances. Explicitly addressing constraints and undesirable states through penalties makes the heuristic's behavior predictable.
