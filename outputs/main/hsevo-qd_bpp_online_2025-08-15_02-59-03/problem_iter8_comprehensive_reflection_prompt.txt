{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize clarity, interpretability, and a logical hierarchy of objectives. Simple, well-defined strategies like Exact Fit First followed by Best Fit are often more robust than complex, parameter-tuned functions (like sigmoids or exponential blends) that can be sensitive to specific problem instances. Explicitly penalizing unsuitable options is also key.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, well-defined goals (e.g., tightest fit, exact fit). Explicitly handle edge cases (unsuitable bins, zero capacities) and ensure that numerical stability is maintained (e.g., using epsilon for division). Avoid overly complex transformations (like specific sigmoid tunings without clear justification) unless they demonstrably improve performance. Mimic known heuristic strategies (like Best Fit, Exact Fit) directly.\n\nPrioritize exact fits with the highest score, then apply a refined Best Fit strategy. Avoid arbitrary secondary criteria and ensure the scoring mechanism directly reflects the desired packing objective (e.g., minimizing remaining capacity). Simulating sequential heuristics like First Fit via priority scores is generally less effective.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
