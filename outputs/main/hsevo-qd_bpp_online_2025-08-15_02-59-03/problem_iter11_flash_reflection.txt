**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Exact fit + graded Best Fit) vs. Heuristic 10 (Basic inverse of remaining capacity without handling exact fits or suitability): Heuristic 1 is superior due to its explicit handling of exact fits and its more nuanced scoring for non-exact fits, leading to more predictable and often better packing.

Comparing Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 12 (Simple inverse of remaining capacity for fitting bins): Heuristic 1's explicit high priority for exact fits (score 2.0) and graded scoring for non-exact fits (1.0 / diff) provides a more robust "Best Fit" approach than Heuristic 12's simple inverse, which might not distinguish between exact fits and other close fits as effectively.

Comparing Heuristic 2 (Modified Best Fit with perfect fit prioritization) vs. Heuristic 11 (Balanced Fit, prioritizing moderate remaining capacity): Heuristic 2's explicit prioritization of perfect fits (score 2.0) and then a graded "least remaining capacity" for others is a clear hierarchy. Heuristic 11's approach of peaking at a moderate remaining capacity (using `r * exp(-k*r)`) is a different strategy that might perform better in some scenarios by avoiding overly full bins, but lacks the clear initial preference for exact fits that Heuristic 2 provides.

Comparing Heuristic 18/19 (Exact fit + scaled Best Fit) vs. Heuristic 1 (Exact fit + graded Best Fit): Heuristics 18/19 use a scaled inverse of the difference for non-exact fits, normalized to a range below the exact fit priority. Heuristic 1 uses a simpler inverse. Heuristics 18/19 offer a more controlled prioritization for non-exact fits, ensuring they are clearly secondary to exact fits.

Comparing Heuristic 16 (First Fit simulation) vs. Heuristic 20 (First Fit simulation with minor index bias): Both are attempts to mimic First Fit (FF). Heuristic 16 and 20 assign a high priority to the *first* bin that fits. The minor bias in Heuristic 20 is an artificial way to favor earlier bins, which is inherent in FF's sequential nature. However, a true FF implementation typically involves sequential iteration, not just scoring. These are less sophisticated than "Best Fit" variations.

Overall: Heuristics that explicitly prioritize exact fits and then use a graded approach for "Best Fit" (like 1, 18, 19) or combine exact fits with a well-defined secondary strategy (like 2, 9) tend to be better. Simple "Best Fit" (12, 13) or variations that aim for moderate fill (11, 14, 15) are also reasonable. Heuristics simulating First Fit (16, 20) or basic inverse scoring without refinement (10) are generally less robust.

**Experience:**
Explicitly prioritizing exact fits is crucial. A graded "Best Fit" approach, valuing smaller remaining capacities, is generally effective. Strategies aiming for a moderate remaining capacity (like `r * exp(-k*r)`) offer an alternative to pure Best Fit, potentially improving overall utilization by avoiding overly full bins. Simple inversions or simulations of sequential search heuristics like FF are less nuanced.
