Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Best Fit strategy.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    suitable_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if np.any(suitable_bins_mask):\n        remaining_capacities = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask] - item\n        min_remaining_capacity = np.min(remaining_capacities)\n        best_fit_mask = (bins_remain_cap >= item) & (bins_remain_cap - item == min_remaining_capacity)\n        priorities[best_fit_mask] = 1.0\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nHere's a redefinition of self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, measurable improvement, adaptive strategies, principled design.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* a strategy works. Does it directly address a quantifiable objective (e.g., minimizing waste)? Explore how to *adapt* to different problem characteristics, rather than just mimicking existing ones.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, arbitrary mathematical functions (like `r * exp(-k*r)`) without a clear theoretical or empirical justification for their specific form. Avoid \"simulating\" known heuristics if a more direct, objective-driven approach is possible.\n*   **Explanation:** The goal is to build heuristics that are understood through their objective alignment and demonstrable performance improvements, not through the intricacy of their mathematical formulation or a blind imitation of prior methods.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
