Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Objective alignment, iterative refinement, empirical validation, robust design.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how your heuristic *directly* optimizes the primary objective. If a secondary criterion is needed, ensure it's a logical extension or a robust tie-breaker, not an arbitrary addition. Validate performance against diverse problem instances.
*   **Avoid:** Relying on "mimicking" existing heuristics without understanding their underlying logic. Over-engineering with complex, unproven transformations or prioritizing easily quantifiable but less impactful metrics.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection in heuristic design means dissecting *why* a strategy works, ensuring alignment with the core problem, and building robustness through testing, not just imitation or complexity.
