Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Objective Alignment, Robustness, Simplicity, Empirical Validation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how your heuristic directly addresses the *specific objective* (e.g., minimizing wasted space, maximizing item packing). Build in mechanisms to gracefully handle boundary conditions and data irregularities.
*   **Avoid:** Over-engineering with complex, unjustified mathematical transformations or blindly copying existing heuristics without understanding their underlying rationale in your context.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection means ensuring your heuristic's design choices are *purposeful*, testable, and contribute directly to solving the problem, rather than adding unnecessary complexity or relying on unverified assumptions.
