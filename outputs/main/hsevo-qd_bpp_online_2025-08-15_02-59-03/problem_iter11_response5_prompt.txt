Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Heuristic 11's approach of peaking at a moderate remaining capacity (using `r * exp(-k*r)`) is a different strategy that might perform better in some scenarios by avoiding overly full bins, but lacks the clear initial preference for exact fits that Heuristic 2 provides.\n\nComparing Heuristic 18/19 (Exact fit + scaled Best Fit) vs. Heuristic 1 (Exact fit + graded Best Fit): Heuristics 18/19 use a scaled inverse of the difference for non-exact fits, normalized to a range below the exact fit priority. Heuristic 1 uses a simpler inverse. Heuristics 18/19 offer a more controlled prioritization for non-exact fits, ensuring they are clearly secondary to exact fits.\n\nComparing Heuristic 16 (First Fit simulation) vs. Heuristic 20 (First Fit simulation with minor index bias): Both are attempts to mimic First Fit (FF). Heuristic 16 and 20 assign a high priority to the *first* bin that fits. The minor bias in Heuristic 20 is an artificial way to favor earlier bins, which is inherent in FF's sequential nature. However, a true FF implementation typically involves sequential iteration, not just scoring. These are less sophisticated than \"Best Fit\" variations.\n\nOverall: Heuristics that explicitly prioritize exact fits and then use a graded approach for \"Best Fit\" (like 1, 18, 19) or combine exact fits with a well-defined secondary strategy (like 2, 9) tend to be better. Simple \"Best Fit\" (12, 13) or variations that aim for moderate fill (11, 14, 15) are also reasonable. Heuristics simulating First Fit (16, 20) or basic inverse scoring without refinement (10) are generally less robust.\n- \nHere's a redefinition of self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, measurable improvement, adaptive strategies, principled design.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* a strategy works. Does it directly address a quantifiable objective (e.g., minimizing waste)? Explore how to *adapt* to different problem characteristics, rather than just mimicking existing ones.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, arbitrary mathematical functions (like `r * exp(-k*r)`) without a clear theoretical or empirical justification for their specific form. Avoid \"simulating\" known heuristics if a more direct, objective-driven approach is possible.\n*   **Explanation:** The goal is to build heuristics that are understood through their objective alignment and demonstrable performance improvements, not through the intricacy of their mathematical formulation or a blind imitation of prior methods.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
