**Analysis:**
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 8 (and 2, 4, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20):** Heuristic 1 (Exact Fit, then Best Fit with penalty) is more direct and explicit about its prioritization. Heuristics 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 17, 20 use sigmoid or exponential functions to model "tightness" or "moderate fit". While potentially more nuanced, they are less interpretable and rely on tuned parameters (`scaling_factor`, `steepness`, `k`). Heuristic 1's clear hierarchy of Exact Fit > Best Fit is generally a strong and understandable strategy.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 3:** Heuristic 1 uses a distinct highest priority (1.0) for exact fits and then scales other fits. Heuristic 3 uses a higher priority (2.0) for exact fits, which is a clearer way to denote absolute preference. However, Heuristic 1's approach of using 1.0 for exact fits and then scaling others below that is also valid. Heuristic 3's score for non-exact fits (`1.0 / (difference + 1e-9)`) can lead to very high priorities for very small differences, potentially more volatile than Heuristic 1's approach.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 5 & 6 (and 9):** Heuristics 5, 6, and 9 introduce a secondary criterion (favoring bins that are less empty). Heuristic 1 prioritizes tightest fits after exact fits. The introduction of secondary criteria adds complexity and tunable parameters (like the scaling for non-best-fit bins) that might not always be beneficial. Heuristic 1's focused approach is simpler.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 7 & 9:** Heuristics 7 and 9 attempt to refine Best Fit by penalizing "too full" bins or by favoring a peak at a moderate remaining capacity (`r_after * exp(-k*r_after)`). While these are interesting "outside the box" ideas, they introduce more parameters (`tolerance`, `k`, `weights`, `tightness_threshold_factor`) and are less straightforward than Heuristic 1's clear Best Fit logic.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 13 (First Fit):** Heuristic 1 (Best Fit) is generally considered better than First Fit for minimizing the number of bins, as it makes more informed local decisions. Heuristic 13 is a basic implementation of First Fit and doesn't use priority scores in a way that allows for selection among multiple fitting bins.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 15 & 17:** Heuristics 15 and 17 combine exact fit (1.0) with a sigmoid score for tight fits. The sigmoid approach (`1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratio - 1)))`) aims to penalize larger bins. Heuristic 1's approach is simpler: exact fits first, then pure Best Fit (implicitly, by penalizing bins that cannot fit). The sigmoid adds complexity with the `k` parameter.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 16 & 20:** Heuristics 16 and 20 use a multi-component scoring system (tightness, anti-tightness, fullness preference) with weights. This is significantly more complex and parameter-dependent than Heuristic 1.
*   **Heuristics 1 vs 18:** Heuristic 18 combines exact fit (1.0) with inverse remaining capacity, scaled. It also assigns a low priority to unsuitable bins. Heuristic 1's explicit penalty for unsuitable bins (implicitly by assigning 0 priority) and its clear two-tier Best Fit logic make it more understandable.
*   **Overall:** Heuristic 1 stands out for its clarity, simplicity, and effective combination of two strong strategies (Exact Fit First and Best Fit). It avoids complex, tunable functions or multi-component scores, making it a robust and easy-to-understand heuristic. The other heuristics introduce complexity (sigmoid, multi-factor scoring, peak functions) often tied to specific tunable parameters or less direct logic.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize clarity, interpretability, and a logical hierarchy of objectives. Simple, well-defined strategies like Exact Fit First followed by Best Fit are often more robust than complex, parameter-tuned functions (like sigmoids or exponential blends) that can be sensitive to specific problem instances. Explicitly penalizing unsuitable options is also key.
