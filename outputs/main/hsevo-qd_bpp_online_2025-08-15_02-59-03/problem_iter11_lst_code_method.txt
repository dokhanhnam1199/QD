Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.\n- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:\n\"**Analysis:**\n**Experience:**\"\nIn there:\n+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.\nExample: \"Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:\"\n\n+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
