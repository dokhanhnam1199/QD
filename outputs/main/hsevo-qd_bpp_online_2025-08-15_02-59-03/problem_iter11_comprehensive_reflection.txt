Here's a redefinition of self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, measurable improvement, adaptive strategies, principled design.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* a strategy works. Does it directly address a quantifiable objective (e.g., minimizing waste)? Explore how to *adapt* to different problem characteristics, rather than just mimicking existing ones.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, arbitrary mathematical functions (like `r * exp(-k*r)`) without a clear theoretical or empirical justification for their specific form. Avoid "simulating" known heuristics if a more direct, objective-driven approach is possible.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to build heuristics that are understood through their objective alignment and demonstrable performance improvements, not through the intricacy of their mathematical formulation or a blind imitation of prior methods.
