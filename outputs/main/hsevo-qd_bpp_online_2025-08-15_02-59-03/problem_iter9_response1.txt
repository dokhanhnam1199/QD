            # So, we need to find the minimum of `bins_remain_cap[best_fit_bins_mask]`.
            
            # Example:
            # item = 3
            # bins_remain_cap = [5, 5, 8, 10]
            # suitable_bins_mask = [T, T, T, T]

            # min_original_capacity_among_best_fit = 5
            # most_full_best_fit_mask = [T, T, F, F]
            # priorities[most_full_best_fit_mask] = 1.0
            # This is still the same as the original best fit if capacities are identical.

            # What if we want to prioritize bins that, after fitting, leave a *very small* remaining gap?
            # This is already captured by the best fit.
            
            # Consider the "First Fit Decreasing" intuition: larger items first.
            # In an online setting, we don't know future items.
            # The advice: "Focus on intuitive, rule-based strategies. Define a clear, prioritized sequence of simple objectives."

            # Let's try a multi-objective approach represented by a single score:
            # Objective 1: Minimize remaining capacity after fit (Best Fit).
            # Objective 2: Maximize initial fullness (minimize initial remaining capacity) among best fit.
            
            # The current `priorities[best_fit_bins_mask] = 1.0` already captures Best Fit.
            # If there's a tie in Best Fit (multiple bins result in `min_remaining_capacity`),
            # we need to break it. The prompt suggests "explicit penalties, logical hierarchy".
            
            # Let's assign priorities such that the "most full" among best-fit bins gets the absolute highest.
            # If there's only one best-fit bin, it gets the highest score.
            # If there are multiple best-fit bins, we need to differentiate them.

            # A clearer way to implement the tie-breaker:
            
            # 1. Find all bins that can fit the item.
            # 2. Calculate the remaining capacity after fitting for each suitable bin.
            # 3. Find the minimum of these remaining capacities. This is the 'best fit' target.
            # 4. Identify all bins that achieve this minimum remaining capacity (these are the 'best fit' bins).
            # 5. Among these 'best fit' bins, find the one with the minimum *original* remaining capacity. This is the 'most full best fit' bin.
            # 6. Assign the highest priority score to this 'most full best fit' bin.
            # 7. Assign a slightly lower, but still high, priority score to other 'best fit' bins if they exist.
            # 8. Assign lower scores to bins that are suitable but not best fit.
            
            # Let's refine the scores to be distinct if needed for selection.
            
            # A common heuristic is "Best Fit Decreasing" but in online, we don't have 'decreasing'.
            # "Best Fit" is the base. "Worst Fit" is another option.
            # "First Fit" is also common.

            # Consider the advice: "Explicitly addressing constraints and undesirable states through penalties makes the heuristic's behavior predictable."
            # What's undesirable? Having bins with very small remaining capacities that can't fit much.
            # So, we want to avoid creating too many "almost full" bins unless necessary.
            
            # Let's try to create a scoring mechanism that inherently ranks.
            
            # For each suitable bin, we can assign a score.
            # Score = (high value) if it's a best fit.
            # Secondary criterion: if it's a best fit, add a bonus if its original capacity was small.
            
            # Let's try to assign scores directly:
            
            # For suitable bins:
            # Calculate remaining capacity after fit: `rem_cap_after = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask] - item`
            # Calculate original remaining capacity: `orig_rem_cap = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask]`
            
            # We want to prioritize bins where `rem_cap_after` is minimized.
            # Then, among those with minimum `rem_cap_after`, we want to prioritize bins where `orig_rem_cap` is minimized.
            
            # Let's create a composite score.
            # A simple way to combine two objectives:
            # Score = - (remaining capacity after fit) + epsilon * (-original remaining capacity)
            # Using negative values because we want to maximize the score.
            # epsilon should be small enough not to dominate the primary criterion.
            
            # Let's simplify again. The core of Best Fit is minimizing `bins_remain_cap - item`.
            # The "better" version should likely enhance this or add a meaningful secondary criterion.
            
            # The hint "Logical Hierarchy":
            # Priority 1: Bin must be suitable (capacity >= item).
            # Priority 2: Bin should minimize `capacity - item`. (Best Fit)
            # Priority 3 (Tie-breaker): Among bins satisfying P2, choose the one with minimum `capacity`. (Most full initially)
