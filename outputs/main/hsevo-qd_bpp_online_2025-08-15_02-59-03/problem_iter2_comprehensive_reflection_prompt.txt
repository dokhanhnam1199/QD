{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, well-defined goals (e.g., tightest fit, exact fit). Explicitly handle edge cases (unsuitable bins, zero capacities) and ensure that numerical stability is maintained (e.g., using epsilon for division). Avoid overly complex transformations (like specific sigmoid tunings without clear justification) unless they demonstrably improve performance. Mimic known heuristic strategies (like Best Fit, Exact Fit) directly.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
