**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic utilizes an adaptive temperature based on edge variance, sparsification, and node desirability, while the bottom heuristic relies on inverse distance, stochasticity, node degree, and global penalization without normalization or adaptive parameters. (2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical, implying the ranker does not differentiate between them. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see only hyperparameter differences. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, implying the ranker does not differentiate between them. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), heuristics 19 and 20 are exactly the same. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate adaptive mechanisms like temperature scaling based on variance and dynamic sparsification, whereas the worst rely on static combinations of factors, often without normalization, adaptive elements, or clear mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. Normalization and adaptive parameters are key differentiators.

**Experience:**
Prioritize adaptive components (temperature, sparsification) in heuristics. Normalize outputs to ensure fair contributions from different factors. Dynamically adjust exploration/exploitation balance. Avoid static combinations of factors without normalization.
