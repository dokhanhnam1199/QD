- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a redefinition of "Current self-reflection" focused on designing better heuristics, avoiding common pitfalls, and a roadmap for improvement:

*   **Keywords:** Heuristic design, exploitation-exploration balance, global context, premature convergence, adaptive strategies, performance metrics.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt their exploration/exploitation ratio based on search progress and problem characteristics. Incorporate global information strategically, using it to guide, not dictate, the search. Rigorously test and benchmark heuristics against diverse problem instances.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on any single strategy (e.g., pure exploitation), neglecting global problem context, ignoring performance metrics and feedback loops.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a nuanced understanding of the problem landscape. Balance short-term gains with broader exploration guided by global awareness and adapt your strategy based on real-world performance data.
