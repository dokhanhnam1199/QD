**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses adaptive temperature scaling based on edge variance, a concept absent in the worst, which uses fixed weights for inverse distance, stochasticity, and node desirability. (2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical, suggesting their ranking may be due to random variation during evaluation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see only difference in parameters. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical, indicating a similar situation. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The top heuristics focus on adaptive parameters based on the evolving search state, while the worst relies on fixed weighting of simpler components. Incorporating adaptive mechanisms is key to better performance. The use of shortest paths, savings heuristics, and contextual node connectivity appear sporadically across the rankings.

**Experience:**
Adaptive parameters, especially temperature based on edge variance, are crucial. Exploring different combinations of shortest paths, savings heuristics and node connectivity should also provide an improvement. Calibrating the weights of combined heuristics matters. Finally, normalization is often important.
