- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a refined definition of "Current Self-Reflection" focused on designing better heuristics, built around your feedback and designed to avoid ineffective practices:

**Current Self-Reflection (Refined):**

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Normalized, Contextual, Exploration/Exploitation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt their components (e.g., parameters, search strategies) based on the problem context and search progress. Normalize data before combining factors. Prioritize balancing exploration and exploitation throughout the search.
*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, combinations of unnormalized factors, ignoring global context.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to react intelligently to the problem instance and search trajectory. Rigidity and a lack of awareness leads to suboptimal performance. Normalization ensures fair evaluation and contribution of features or components.
