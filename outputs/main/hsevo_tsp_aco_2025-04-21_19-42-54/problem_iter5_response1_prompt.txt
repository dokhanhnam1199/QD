(2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical, implying the ranker does not differentiate between them. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see only hyperparameter differences. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, implying the ranker does not differentiate between them. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), heuristics 19 and 20 are exactly the same. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate adaptive mechanisms like temperature scaling based on variance and dynamic sparsification, whereas the worst rely on static combinations of factors, often without normalization, adaptive elements, or clear mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation. Normalization and adaptive parameters are key differentiators.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, here's a refined definition of \"Current Self-Reflection\" focused on designing better heuristics, built around your feedback and designed to avoid ineffective practices:\n\n**Current Self-Reflection (Refined):**\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Normalized, Contextual, Exploration/Exploitation.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt their components (e.g., parameters, search strategies) based on the problem context and search progress. Normalize data before combining factors. Prioritize balancing exploration and exploitation throughout the search.\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, combinations of unnormalized factors, ignoring global context.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to react intelligently to the problem instance and search trajectory. Rigidity and a lack of awareness leads to suboptimal performance. Normalization ensures fair evaluation and contribution of features or components.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `heuristics_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
