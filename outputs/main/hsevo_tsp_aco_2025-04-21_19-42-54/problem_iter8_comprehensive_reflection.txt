- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Dynamic Calibration, Contextual Awareness, Exploration-Exploitation Balance, Adaptive Strategies.
*   **Advice:** Focus on creating self-aware heuristics that adapt based on real-time performance and global solution context. Use dynamic calibration to continuously optimize the weights of different heuristic components.
*   **Avoid:** Static parameter settings and heuristic combinations lacking a feedback loop. Avoid relying solely on local information.
*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics that "learn" during the search, dynamically adjusting parameters and strategies based on their impact on solution quality. Integrate global context to guide the search towards promising regions and prevent stagnation.
