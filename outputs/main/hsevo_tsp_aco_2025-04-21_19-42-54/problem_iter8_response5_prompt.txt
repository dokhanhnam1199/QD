(2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical, suggesting their ranking may be due to random variation during evaluation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see only difference in parameters. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical, indicating a similar situation. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The top heuristics focus on adaptive parameters based on the evolving search state, while the worst relies on fixed weighting of simpler components. Incorporating adaptive mechanisms is key to better performance. The use of shortest paths, savings heuristics, and contextual node connectivity appear sporadically across the rankings.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Dynamic Calibration, Contextual Awareness, Exploration-Exploitation Balance, Adaptive Strategies.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on creating self-aware heuristics that adapt based on real-time performance and global solution context. Use dynamic calibration to continuously optimize the weights of different heuristic components.\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameter settings and heuristic combinations lacking a feedback loop. Avoid relying solely on local information.\n*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics that \"learn\" during the search, dynamically adjusting parameters and strategies based on their impact on solution quality. Integrate global context to guide the search towards promising regions and prevent stagnation.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `heuristics_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
