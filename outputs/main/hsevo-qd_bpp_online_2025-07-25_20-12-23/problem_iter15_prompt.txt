Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This design implements a heuristic based on the remaining capacity of the bins.\n    Is a priority score based on filling tighter bins first, aiming to close the \n    bins as much as possible to trigger first fit for new bins sooner.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Inverse of remaining capacity (sinusoidal function to prioritize the almost full bins)\n    return 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + 0.1)  # adding a small epsilon to avoid division by zero\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive scaling, reward/penalty systems, nuanced control, multiple factors\n- **Advice**: Implement adaptive scaling and balanced reward/penalty systems that incorporate strategic conditions and avoid overly detailed penalties/rewards\n- **Avoid**: Overly simplistic heuristics, unnecessary functions or complexities, detailed balancing that might reduce efficiency, and neglecting strategic placement rewards\n- **Explanation**: Focus on integrating adaptive mechanisms that can adjust based on the current state of the bin packing problem while balancing rewards and penalties to encourage strategic placements. This should be nuanced enough to guide the heuristic effectively without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
