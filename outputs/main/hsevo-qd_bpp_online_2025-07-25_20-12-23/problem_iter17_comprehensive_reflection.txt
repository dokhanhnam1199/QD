- **Keywords**: Adaptive scaling, strategic rewards, underutilization penalties, nuanced control.
- **Advice**: Develop flexible heuristics with dynamic rewards for exact fits and strategic penalties for inefficient placements, balancing bin usage precisely to avoid large leftovers.
- **Avoid**: Simplicity-driven shortcuts (e.g., simplistic priority measures) and single-factor optimizations (e.g., balancing bin usage alone).
- **Explanation**: By focusing on adaptive scaling and strategic rewards/penalties, you enhance your heuristics' ability to navigate complex scenarios effectively, avoiding inefficiencies and leveraging optimal packing conditions without resorting to overly simplistic approaches.
