**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st) effectively balances between not exceeding the bin capacity and minimizing the leftover space, which leads to efficient bin usage and minimizes waste. The worst heuristic (20th) prioritizes bins with the largest remaining capacity regardless of the leftover space, leading to underutilized bins and higher waste. (Second best) vs (second worst) shows a stark contrast in flexibility; while the second best considers both the space left and exact fitting, the second worst purely penalizes larger empty spaces. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first efficiently uses both penalties and bonuses, whereas the second complicates the priority with a sinusoidal function that may not effectively prioritize closely filled bins. (3rd) vs (4th) shows redundant implementations of similar logic with the fourth introducing unnecessary complexity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see a minimal difference in approach; both prioritize large remaining capacity without differentiating the leftover space effectively. Overall, the most effective heuristics balance penalties for leftover space with incentives for efficient bin usage, highlighting the need for simplicity and a clear approach to balance these factors.

**Experience:**
Balancing bin usage by penalizing large leftover spaces and rewarding efficient fits leads to better packing efficiency. Simplicity in heuristic design is crucial, avoiding unnecessary functions or complexities.
