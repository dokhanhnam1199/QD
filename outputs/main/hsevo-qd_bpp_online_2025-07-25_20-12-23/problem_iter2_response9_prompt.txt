Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The worst heuristic (20th) prioritizes bins with the largest remaining capacity regardless of the leftover space, leading to underutilized bins and higher waste. (Second best) vs (second worst) shows a stark contrast in flexibility; while the second best considers both the space left and exact fitting, the second worst purely penalizes larger empty spaces. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first efficiently uses both penalties and bonuses, whereas the second complicates the priority with a sinusoidal function that may not effectively prioritize closely filled bins. (3rd) vs (4th) shows redundant implementations of similar logic with the fourth introducing unnecessary complexity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see a minimal difference in approach; both prioritize large remaining capacity without differentiating the leftover space effectively. Overall, the most effective heuristics balance penalties for leftover space with incentives for efficient bin usage, highlighting the need for simplicity and a clear approach to balance these factors.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Bin packing, efficiency, simplicity, penalization, reward, heuristics.\n- **Advice**: Focus on clear and adaptable scoring systems that penalize poor packing and reward optimal use. Incorporate machine learning techniques to dynamically adjust penalties and rewards based on empirical data.\n- **Avoid**: Overly complex calculations that do not significantly improve efficiency; rigid systems that do not adapt to different scenarios; unnecessary penalizations or rewards that do not contribute to better outcomes.\n- **Explanation**: By maintaining simplicity while allowing for adaptability and intelligent adjustments, the heuristic can effectively optimize bin usage without introducing unnecessary complexity. This balance ensures that the heuristic remains both efficient and effective across a wide range of scenarios.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
