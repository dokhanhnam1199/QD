{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nBalanced rewards, penalties, and adaptive scaling in heuristics lead to more efficient bin packing.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nBalancing bin usage by penalizing large leftover spaces and rewarding efficient fits leads to better packing efficiency. Simplicity in heuristic design is crucial, avoiding unnecessary functions or complexities.\n\nPrioritize detailed balancing with specific penalties/rewards and adaptive scaling to design robust heuristics.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
