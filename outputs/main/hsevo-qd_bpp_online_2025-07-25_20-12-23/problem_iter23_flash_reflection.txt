**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (Heuristics 1st) effectively balances exact fit prioritization and adaptive sigmoid rewards, leading to better capacity utilization compared to the worst heuristic (Heuristics 19th) that simply prioritizes bins that can fit the item based on remaining capacity.
(second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the primary differences are in the sigmoid function parameters and the presence of a penalty for bins that cannot fit the item, making the first more robust in penalizing inefficient placements.
(3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (4th) vs (5th), and (5th) vs (6th) show no significant differences, indicating redundancy in the ranking of these heuristics.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no meaningful distinction in mechanisms, both focusing on basic fit capacity without penalties or rewards for efficiency.
Overall, the best heuristics incorporate exact fit bonuses, dynamic scaling, and penalties for inefficiencies, promoting balanced and efficient bin packing.

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by integrating exact fit bonuses, adaptive scaling, and penalties/priorities for efficient utilization, avoiding simple fit capacity checks.
