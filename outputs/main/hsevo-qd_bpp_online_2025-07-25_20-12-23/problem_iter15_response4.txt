    This version uses an adaptive scaling mechanism to prioritize bins that
    are closer to being filled, while also penalizing bins that are too full
    to fit the current item. It aims to balance rewards and penalties to
    encourage strategic placements.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
