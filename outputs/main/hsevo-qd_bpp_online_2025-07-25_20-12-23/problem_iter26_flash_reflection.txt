**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st) uses a complex multi-factorial design with adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, penalties for inefficiencies, underutilization, and sigmoid rewards, which are meticulously tuned with specific hyperparameters. The worst heuristic (20th) simply multiplies the boolean mask of whether the item can fit into the bin by the remaining capacity divided by the item size, lacking depth in policy components. 
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see that the second-best uses adaptive scaling, exact fit prioritization, and sigmoid rewards, while the 19th uses a much simpler heuristic that emphasizes immediate fitting capability and remaining capacity proportionally.
Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), we see identical code except for comments, suggesting no differences in functionality.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see additional penalties and rewards in the 1st heuristic, improving the balance between efficiency and effective placement.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second-worst also emphasizes immediate fitting capability but adds sophistication through rewards and penalties for remaining capacity usage, distinguishing it from the simplest approach of the worst.
Comparing the most complex (1st, 2nd) heuristics with the simpler (19th, 20th) heuristics, we observe that complexity leads to potentially better adaptability and fine-grained control over bin usage, at the cost of higher computational overhead.
Overall, the most effective heuristics are those with adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, penalties for inefficiencies, and proportionate sigmoid rewards, indicating a balance between efficiency and adaptability.

**Experience:**
Complex heuristics with adaptive scaling, rewards, and penalties improve efficiency and adaptability at the cost of complexity, suggesting tailored policy components for effective bin packed solutions.
