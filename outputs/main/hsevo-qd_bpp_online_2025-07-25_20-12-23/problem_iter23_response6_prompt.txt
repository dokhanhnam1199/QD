Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority score for each bin using a combination of penalty and reward,\n    balancing leftover space and efficiency with adaptive scaling.\n    \"\"\"\n    ifbinsfit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    penalty = np.where(ifbinsfit, 0, -np.inf)\n    reward = np.where(ifbinsfit, 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 0.1), 0)\n    priority_score = penalty + reward\n    return priority_score\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This heuristic emphasizes adaptability and simplicity by prioritizing bins that \n    can immediately accommodate the item while still considering how full the bins are.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Priority score based on whether the bin can fit the item and remaining capacity\n    can_fit = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    return can_fit * (bins_remain_cap / item)\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (Heuristics 1st) effectively balances exact fit prioritization and adaptive sigmoid rewards, leading to better capacity utilization compared to the worst heuristic (Heuristics 19th) that simply prioritizes bins that can fit the item based on remaining capacity.\n(second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the primary differences are in the sigmoid function parameters and the presence of a penalty for bins that cannot fit the item, making the first more robust in penalizing inefficient placements.\n(3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (4th) vs (5th), and (5th) vs (6th) show no significant differences, indicating redundancy in the ranking of these heuristics.\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no meaningful distinction in mechanisms, both focusing on basic fit capacity without penalties or rewards for efficiency.\nOverall, the best heuristics incorporate exact fit bonuses, dynamic scaling, and penalties for inefficiencies, promoting balanced and efficient bin packing.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, penalties, inefficiency, parameter tuning, multifactor design\n- **Advice**: Integrate adaptive scaling mechanisms that dynamically adjust based on current conditions and continuously fine-tune the parameters to balance various factors like exact fit rewards and penalties for inefficiencies.\n- **Avoid**: Simplistic priority measures, unnecessary complexities, overreliance on simple fit capacity checks, ignoring the need for nuanced control over the heuristic design.\n- **Explanation**: Focus on designing heuristics that not only reward efficient or exact fits but also penalize inefficient placements and underutilization. This multifaceted approach ensures that the heuristic can adapt to different scenarios, leading to more optimal solutions. Avoid simplifications that might overlook critical aspects of the problem, ensuring the heuristic remains robust and flexible.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
