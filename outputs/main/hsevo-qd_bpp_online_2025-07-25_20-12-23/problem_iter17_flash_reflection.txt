**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic uses an adaptive scaling mechanism with rewards for exact fills and penalties for small remaining capacities, promoting efficient use of space. The worst heuristic is repetitive and does not adapt to the situation beyond simple inverse priority based on remaining capacity.
(second best) vs (second worst) reveals similar patterns, with the second best using an adaptive scaling and sigmoid functions to balance rewards and penalties effectively. The second worst provides less adaptability and relies solely on inverse capacity, disregarding specific rewards and penalties.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic incorporates a more nuanced adaptive scaling with exact fit rewards and small capacity penalties. The second heuristic only uses a simple inverse of remaining capacity, lacking adaptations to different scenarios.
(3rd) vs (4th) continues the trend of the third heuristic being an adaptive scaling version with strategic rewards and penalties, whereas the fourth solely uses the inverse of remaining capacity.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst still contains the adaptive sigmoid mechanism, which is more advanced than the worst's simple inverse function.

Overall, the top-ranked heuristics are distinguished by their adaptive scaling and reward/penalty logic, ensuring efficient and strategic bin filling, whereas the lower-ranked ones rely solely on simple inverse priority measures.

**Experience:**
Incorporate adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, and penalties for underutilization; avoid simplistic priority measures for better heuristic design.
