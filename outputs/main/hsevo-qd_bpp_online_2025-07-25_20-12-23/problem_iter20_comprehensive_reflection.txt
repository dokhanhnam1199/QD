- **Advice**:
  - Design heuristics that dynamically adjust parameters based on the current state or previous outcomes (adaptive scaling).
  - Implement precise reward systems for obtaining exact fits to encourage optimal packing decisions.
  - Introduce penalties for underutilization or inefficient placements to discourage poor configurations.
  - Emphasize the importance of balancing multiple factors with fine-grained control mechanisms.

- **Avoid**:
  - Over-reliance on simplistic balancing measures like penalizing large leftover spaces without contextual considerations.
  - Neglecting the complexity required for designing robust and adaptive heuristics.
  - Simplicity in heuristic design to the point of overlooking nuanced aspects of efficient solutions.

- **Explanation**: By focusing on adaptive scaling and strategic reward/penalty systems, the heuristic design becomes more dynamic and responsive to various scenarios, leading to better packing efficiency. Avoiding simplism ensures that the heuristic can handle the complexity and nuance of real-world problems, ultimately yielding more efficient results.
