**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st) combines exact fit rewards and penalizes leftover space with exact and adjustable weights, showing balance and adaptability. The worst heuristic (20th) simply assigns priority based on item fit and relative space, which is less nuanced and lacks specific reward structures.
(Second best) vs (second worst) contrasts the detailed penalty and reward system of the second-best heuristic (2nd) with the simpler, less dynamic approach of the second-worst (19th). Both use sigmoid functions but the second-best strategically rewards and penalizes more explicitly.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see minor similarities in approach but the first leverages weights for exact fits and non-fits more effectively.
(3rd) vs (4th) illustrates a more specific reward structure (3rd) compared to a generic inverse of remaining capacity (4th); the third approach targets bins that leave minimal space more precisely.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see subtle improvements in considering relative space left in the second worst heuristic (19th) which adjusts scores based on bin initial sizes whereas the worst (20th) fails to adapt to bigger bin initial sizes effectively.
Overall: The top heuristics combine detailed balancing mechanisms with explicit penalties and rewards, making them more adaptable and effective. The lower heuristics are simpler, often omitting weights, explicit penalties/rewards, and adaptive scaling.

**Experience:**
Prioritize detailed balancing with specific penalties/rewards and adaptive scaling to design robust heuristics.
