- **Keywords**: Efficiency, Adaptability, Simplicity, Balance
- **Advice**: Emphasize adaptability and simplicity in designing heuristics, focusing on incremental adjustments rather than complex reward and penalty systems.
- **Avoid**: Detailed balancing with specific penalties/rewards and adaptive scaling leading to overly complex heuristics.
- **Explanation**: Effective heuristics should be adaptable to different scenarios without relying on a complex system of penalties and rewards. Simplicity ensures they remain flexible and easier to implement, improving their overall efficiency. Overly detailed balancing can introduce unnecessary complexity, leading to heuristics that are less effective and harder to refine.
