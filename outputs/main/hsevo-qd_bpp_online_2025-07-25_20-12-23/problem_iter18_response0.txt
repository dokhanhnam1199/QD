    This version of the priority function implements a heuristic that balances adaptive scaling,
    strategic rewards for exact fits, and penalties for inefficient placements. It aims to efficiently
    use bin space while avoiding large leftovers and promoting optimal packing conditions.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
