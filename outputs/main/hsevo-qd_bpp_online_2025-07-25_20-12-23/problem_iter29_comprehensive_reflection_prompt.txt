{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nCombine adaptive scaling, exact fit prioritization, and sigmoid rewards with penalties and dynamic adjustments to improve bin packing efficiency \u2013 complexity matters in heuristics.\nIncorporate adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, and penalties for underutilization; avoid simplistic priority measures for better heuristic design.\n\nDesign better heuristics by incorporating adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, and penalties for inefficiency. Fine-tuning parameters is crucial for balancing different factors effectively.\n\nComplex heuristics with adaptive scaling, rewards, and penalties improve efficiency and adaptability at the cost of complexity, suggesting tailored policy components for effective bin packed solutions.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nBalancing bin usage by penalizing large leftover spaces and rewarding efficient fits leads to better packing efficiency. Simplicity in heuristic design is crucial, avoiding unnecessary functions or complexities.\n\nPrioritize detailed balancing with specific penalties/rewards and adaptive scaling to design robust heuristics.\n\nBalanced rewards, penalties, and adaptive scaling in heuristics lead to more efficient bin packing.\n\nFor better heuristics, incorporate adaptive mechanisms, use rewards for strategic conditions (e.g., exact fits), and penalties to avoid inefficient placements of items in bins.\n\nIncorporating adaptive scaling and reward/penalty systems significantly enhances bin packing efficiency. Simple fitting checks alone are insufficient for optimal packing. Design heuristics should consider multiple factors for nuanced control over the packing process.\n\nDesign better heuristics by integrating exact fit bonuses, adaptive scaling, and penalties/priorities for efficient utilization, avoiding simple fit capacity checks.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
