**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st) uses adaptive scaling with a reward/penalty system for precise control over bin prioritization, including rewarding bins that would be filled exactly and penalizing very small remaining capacities. It considers multiple factors to efficiently fill the bins. The worst heuristic (20th) only considers whether the bin can fit the item and how full the bin is, without additional rewards or penalties.
(second best) vs (second worst), we see an improvement from the second-best heuristic (2nd) that uses an inverse of the remaining capacity to prioritize nearly full bins, to the second-worst heuristic (19th) that similarly scores bins based on fit possibility but lacks the nuanced adjustments present in the (2nd).
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic includes rewards for exact fits and penalties for bins with very small remaining capacities which are absent in the second heuristic.
(3rd) vs (4th) show no difference in implementation, both have the same problem of large penalties for bins that cannot fit the item, leading to a simple structure without accounting for efficient packing or balancing empty space.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both use the same logic but lack complexity and adaptive adjustments. The final two heuristics exhibit no differences in their implementations.
Overall: There is a significant gap in sophistication and effectiveness between heuristics ranging from those with adaptive scaling and reward/penalty mechanisms to those with simple fit checks.

**Experience:**
Incorporating adaptive scaling and reward/penalty systems significantly enhances bin packing efficiency. Simple fitting checks alone are insufficient for optimal packing. Design heuristics should consider multiple factors for nuanced control over the packing process.
