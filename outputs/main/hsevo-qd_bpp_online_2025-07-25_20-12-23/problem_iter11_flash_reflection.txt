**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic uses an adaptive reward/penalty system combined with sigmoid functions to balance utilization efficiently, while the worst only considers whether an item can fit into a bin, ignoring remaining capacity or penalties for very full bins. (Second best) vs (second worst) also highlights a sophisticated reward system for exact fits and penalties for bins with very small remaining capacities, whereas the second worst still lacks in dynamic decision-making based on capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both using similar base priority mechanisms but the 1st includes additional nuanced rewards and penalties. (3rd) vs (4th) shows slight variations but both prioritize bins that can accommodate the item and use a reward system but without significant differences in complexity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see minimal differences as both focus on whether the item fits, without adaptive mechanisms. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate adaptive mechanisms, rewards, and penalties for smarter decision-making, whereas the worst focus solely on feasibility of item fitting.

**Experience:**
For better heuristics, incorporate adaptive mechanisms, use rewards for strategic conditions (e.g., exact fits), and penalties to avoid inefficient placements of items in bins.
