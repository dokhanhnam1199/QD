- **Keywords**: Adaptive scaling, efficiency, simplicity, specific reward/penalty
- **Advice**: Emphasize simplicity in heuristic structure while implementing adaptive scaling for efficiency improvements. Use specific reward/penalty mechanisms thoughtfully to enhance heuristic robustness.
- **Avoid**: Overcomplicating the heuristic with unnecessary functions; only use penalties/rewards that significantly improve efficiency.
- **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity, you maintain clarity and ease of implementation, reducing potential errors and enhancing speed. Adaptive scaling allows the heuristic to adjust dynamically to diverse problem landscapes, improving robustness. Specific rewards/penalties ensure that the heuristic is guided effectively towards optimal solutions without being misled by less relevant metrics.
