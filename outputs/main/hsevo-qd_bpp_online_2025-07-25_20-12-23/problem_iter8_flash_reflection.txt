**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic uses an adaptive reward/penalty system combined with exact fit rewards and scaled priorities, which efficiently utilizes bin space. The worst heuristic lacks a structured reward/penalty system, instead relying on primarily penalties and sigmoid rewards which is less adaptive and less effective in handling a wide range of scenarios. 
Comparing (second best) vs (second worst), we see the second best prioritizes closing bins with adaptive scaling and exact fit rewards, improving compactness and efficiency. The second worst uses an inverse remaining capacity method, which works well for bins close to capacity but fails to account for potential exact fits and efficiency. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st strategy offers a more balanced approach with adaptive scaling, rewarding exact fits, and penalizing inefficient bins. The 2nd strategy only uses an inverse capacity method, leading to less diversity in bin utilization and efficiency.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both are essentially the same adaptive reward/penalty system. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst employs a combination of penalty and sigmoid reward with adaptive scaling, which is slightly better than the excessive reliance on sigmoid rewards and penalties in the worst heuristic.
Overall, the better heuristics excel due to their adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, and penalty mechanisms, promoting efficient bin packing.

**Experience:**
Balanced rewards, penalties, and adaptive scaling in heuristics lead to more efficient bin packing.
