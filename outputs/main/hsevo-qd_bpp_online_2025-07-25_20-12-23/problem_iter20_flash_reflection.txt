**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic uses an adaptive scoring system with exact fit prioritization, sigmoid rewards for partial fits, and penalties for unsuitable bins, finely tuned with specific parameters. The worst heuristic simply applies a penalty to insufficient bins and a reward inversely proportional to the remaining capacity, without the refined adjustments seen in the best heuristic. Comparing (second best) vs (second worst), the second best retains most characteristics of the best heuristic, while the second worst follows the simplistic scoring of the worst heuristic with minor variations. Overall, the best heuristics incorporate multiple strategic adjustments and adaptive scaling, whereas the worst heuristics lack these nuances, relying on a basic reward-penalty mechanism.

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by incorporating adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, and penalties for inefficiency. Fine-tuning parameters is crucial for balancing different factors effectively.
