Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    item: float, \n    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, \n    penalty: float = -9459.645242722696,\n    sigmoid_threshold_min: float = 0.6896808736373103,\n    sigmoid_threshold_max: float = 0.08876173133481396,\n    sigmoid_slope: float = 1.1169141074890545,\n    sigmoid_offset: float = 0.278808023854411) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines exact fit prioritization with adaptive sigmoid reward to balance filling bins effectively.\n    \"\"\"\n    priority_scores = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    # Exact fit gets highest priority\n    exact_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap == item\n    priority_scores[exact_fit_mask] = 1.0\n    \n    # Non-exact fits are rewarded based on a sigmoid function for capacity utilization\n    non_exact_fit_mask = np.logical_and(bins_remain_cap >= item, ~exact_fit_mask)\n    if np.any(non_exact_fit_mask):\n        new_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap[non_exact_fit_mask] - item\n        reward = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-sigmoid_slope * (new_remain_cap - sigmoid_offset)))\n        priority_scores[non_exact_fit_mask] = reward\n    \n    # Penalize bins that cannot fit the item\n    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, penalty, priority_scores)\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    item: float, \n    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, \n    penalty: float = -3586.2115429161977,\n    sigmoid_threshold_min: float = 0.7607170824887122,\n    sigmoid_threshold_max: float = 0.42411238386705796) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines exact fit prioritization with adaptive sigmoid reward to balance filling bins effectively.\n    \"\"\"\n    priority_scores = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    # Exact fit gets highest priority\n    exact_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap == item\n    priority_scores[exact_fit_mask] = 1.0\n    \n    # Non-exact fits are rewarded based on a sigmoid function for capacity utilization\n    non_exact_fit_mask = np.logical_and(bins_remain_cap >= item, ~exact_fit_mask)\n    if np.any(non_exact_fit_mask):\n        new_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap[non_exact_fit_mask] - item\n        reward = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-new_remain_cap))\n        priority_scores[non_exact_fit_mask] = reward\n    \n    # Penalize bins that cannot fit the item\n    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, penalty, priority_scores)\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (Heuristics 1st) effectively balances exact fit prioritization and adaptive sigmoid rewards, leading to better capacity utilization compared to the worst heuristic (Heuristics 19th) that simply prioritizes bins that can fit the item based on remaining capacity.\n(second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the primary differences are in the sigmoid function parameters and the presence of a penalty for bins that cannot fit the item, making the first more robust in penalizing inefficient placements.\n(3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (4th) vs (5th), and (5th) vs (6th) show no significant differences, indicating redundancy in the ranking of these heuristics.\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no meaningful distinction in mechanisms, both focusing on basic fit capacity without penalties or rewards for efficiency.\nOverall, the best heuristics incorporate exact fit bonuses, dynamic scaling, and penalties for inefficiencies, promoting balanced and efficient bin packing.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive scaling, exact fit rewards, penalties, inefficiency, parameter tuning, multifactor design\n- **Advice**: Integrate adaptive scaling mechanisms that dynamically adjust based on current conditions and continuously fine-tune the parameters to balance various factors like exact fit rewards and penalties for inefficiencies.\n- **Avoid**: Simplistic priority measures, unnecessary complexities, overreliance on simple fit capacity checks, ignoring the need for nuanced control over the heuristic design.\n- **Explanation**: Focus on designing heuristics that not only reward efficient or exact fits but also penalize inefficient placements and underutilization. This multifaceted approach ensures that the heuristic can adapt to different scenarios, leading to more optimal solutions. Avoid simplifications that might overlook critical aspects of the problem, ensuring the heuristic remains robust and flexible.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
