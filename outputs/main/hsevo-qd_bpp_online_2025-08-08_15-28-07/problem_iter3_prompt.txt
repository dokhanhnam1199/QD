Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    available_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    available_bins_cap = bins_remain_cap[available_bins_mask]\n    \n    if available_bins_cap.size == 0:\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    inverse_distances = available_bins_cap / (available_bins_cap - item + 1e-9)\n    \n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    priorities[available_bins_mask] = inverse_distances\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Goal-oriented, iterative, context-aware, measurable impact.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on achieving the heuristic's core objective, not just superficial characteristics. Measure performance against defined goals, not just against \"tight fit.\"\n*   **Avoid:** Over-emphasis on simplicity at the expense of effectiveness. Assuming \"tight fit\" automatically equates to good performance.\n*   **Explanation:** True effectiveness comes from solving the problem. Continuously test and refine based on actual outcomes, adapting the heuristic to the specific problem context.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
