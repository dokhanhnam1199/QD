Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Goal-oriented, iterative, context-aware, measurable impact.
*   **Advice:** Focus on achieving the heuristic's core objective, not just superficial characteristics. Measure performance against defined goals, not just against "tight fit."
*   **Avoid:** Over-emphasis on simplicity at the expense of effectiveness. Assuming "tight fit" automatically equates to good performance.
*   **Explanation:** True effectiveness comes from solving the problem. Continuously test and refine based on actual outcomes, adapting the heuristic to the specific problem context.
