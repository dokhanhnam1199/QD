{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and directness for heuristics. Focus on minimizing wasted space (\"tight fit,\" \"almost full\") as a primary goal. Complex, multi-component heuristics require careful tuning and may not always outperform simpler, well-defined strategies. Ensure zero-priority cases are handled correctly.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
