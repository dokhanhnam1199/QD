    Best Fit strategy for online Bin Packing Problem.

    The priority is calculated based on how well the item fits into each bin.
    A smaller remaining capacity after placing the item indicates a better fit.
    To prioritize bins that are "almost full" but can still accommodate the item,
    we can assign a higher priority to bins where the remaining capacity is
    closest to zero after the item is placed.

    We can define the priority as the inverse of the remaining capacity after
    placing the item. However, to avoid division by zero or very large numbers
    for bins that are almost full, we can use a function that maps smaller
    remaining capacities to higher priorities.

    A common approach is to use `1 / (remaining_capacity + epsilon)` where
    epsilon is a small constant to avoid division by zero.
    Alternatively, we can use a function that is monotonically decreasing
    with remaining capacity, such as `max_capacity - remaining_capacity`.
    For Best Fit, we want the *smallest* remaining capacity after packing,
    which means the *least* amount of "wasted" space.

    So, if `r_i` is the remaining capacity of bin `i` and `item` is the item size:
    The new remaining capacity is `r_i - item`.
    We want to minimize `r_i - item` for bins where `r_i >= item`.

    Let's assign a high priority to bins that result in a small positive
    remaining capacity.
    Priority can be `large_number - (r_i - item)`.
    Or more simply, priority can be the negative of the difference: `-(r_i - item)`.
    This way, a smaller `r_i - item` (closer to 0) will result in a higher priority
    (closer to 0 or positive).

    We should only consider bins where the item can actually fit.

    # Assign a high priority to bins that leave the least remaining space.
    # We want to minimize `remaining_capacities_after_fit`.
    # A simple way to convert minimization to maximization for priority is
    # to use `1 / (value + epsilon)` or `max_value - value`.
    # Let's use a heuristic that rewards smaller positive remaining capacities.
    # A small epsilon to avoid division by zero if an item perfectly fills a bin.

    # Higher priority for smaller remaining capacity.
    # If remaining capacity is x, priority is 1/(x+epsilon).
    # If x=0, priority is 1/epsilon (very high).
    # If x is small positive, priority is large.
    # If x is large, priority is small.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (remaining_capacities_after_fit + epsilon)
    
    # To ensure that bins where the item *exactly* fits get the absolute highest priority,
    # we can further boost them. Or simply, the `1 / (epsilon)` already does this.
