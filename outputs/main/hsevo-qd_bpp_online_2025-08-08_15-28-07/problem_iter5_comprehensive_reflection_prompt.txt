{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize direct \"Best Fit\" strategies using simple, monotonic functions (like sigmoid on negative difference) for clear optimization goals. Avoid overly complex, multi-component, or parametrically tuned functions unless a specific need for a non-monotonic preference (like a \"sweet spot\") is well-justified and tested. Ensure heuristics correctly handle edge cases like non-fitting items.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and directness for heuristics. Focus on minimizing wasted space (\"tight fit,\" \"almost full\") as a primary goal. Complex, multi-component heuristics require careful tuning and may not always outperform simpler, well-defined strategies. Ensure zero-priority cases are handled correctly.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
