**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (inverse distances) with Heuristic 2 (sigmoid with weighted sum), Heuristic 1 is simpler and directly targets bins that provide a tight fit by using the inverse ratio of capacities. Heuristic 2 attempts to balance tightness and overall capacity using a sigmoid, but its complexity might not translate to better performance without careful tuning of weights and scaling factors.

Comparing Heuristic 3-8 ("Almost Full Fit" using `1.0 / (remaining_caps_after_fit + epsilon)`) with Heuristic 9 (Best Fit using `-remaining_capacity`), Heuristics 3-8 directly implement the "Almost Full Fit" by prioritizing bins that leave minimal space after placement. Heuristic 9 is a cleaner Best Fit implementation by directly minimizing the negative remaining capacity. The repeated "Almost Full Fit" heuristics (3-8) suggest a strong focus on minimizing residual space, which is a core aspect of efficient bin packing.

Comparing Heuristic 10 (multiplicative combination for "Almost Full Fit") with Heuristic 3-8, Heuristic 10 attempts to combine tight fit (`1/fits`) with initial bin fullness (`item/bins_remain_cap`), which might offer a more nuanced "Almost Full" strategy. However, the simpler inverse of `fits` (as in 3-8) is a more direct interpretation of minimizing residual space.

Comparing Heuristic 19 and 20 (Sigmoid Fit Score with peak around ideal ratio) with others, these heuristics try to find a balance between not too full and not too empty bins using a sigmoid function to model preference. They are more complex than direct "tightest fit" heuristics but aim to optimize for a specific packing characteristic. Heuristic 19/20's approach of creating a peak around an ideal ratio is a sophisticated way to model "good fit" using sigmoids.

Heuristics 14-18 (all zeros) are clearly the worst as they provide no discriminatory priority. Heuristics 11-13 (Epsilon-Greedy) add an exploration component to a Best Fit strategy, which is more applicable in learning scenarios than for deterministic heuristic design.

Overall: Heuristics that directly target minimizing residual space (like "Almost Full Fit" or "Best Fit") appear to be generally strong. Complexity increases with sigmoid-based approaches, which might offer benefits if tuned correctly but can also introduce fragility. Simple, direct mappings often perform well.

**Experience:**
Prioritize simplicity and directness for heuristics. Focus on minimizing wasted space ("tight fit," "almost full") as a primary goal. Complex, multi-component heuristics require careful tuning and may not always outperform simpler, well-defined strategies. Ensure zero-priority cases are handled correctly.
