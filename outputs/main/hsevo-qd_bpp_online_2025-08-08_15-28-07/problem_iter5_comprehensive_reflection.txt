Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, contextual, performance-driven, goal-alignment.
*   **Advice:** Shift focus from *a priori* simplicity to *a posteriori* performance. Design heuristics that adapt to the problem's specific characteristics and performance feedback, rather than strictly adhering to pre-defined simple rules.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on "tight fit" or "almost full" metaphors. These are often proxies for underlying goals, not the goals themselves. Avoid assuming monotonic preferences without empirical validation.
*   **Explanation:** True effectiveness comes from aligning heuristic behavior with measurable optimization outcomes. This means being willing to explore complexity if it demonstrably improves performance on specific objectives, while rigorously testing for robustness and edge-case handling.
