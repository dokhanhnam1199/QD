    # Heuristic: Prioritize bins where the item fits snugly, but also consider

    # We want to favor bins that are a good fit (tightness_score closer to 0)
    # and also bins that have more remaining capacity.
    # Let's use a weighted sum before the sigmoid.
    
    # Higher negative tightness_score means better fit, so we use -tightness_score
    # A positive capacity_score means more space.
    
    # Example weights: Give more importance to a tighter fit

    # Apply sigmoid function
    # We want to give a higher priority to bins where the item fits well,
    # meaning bins_remain_cap - item is close to 0.
    # For bins where it doesn't fit, the priority should be very low.
    # The sigmoid function maps any real number to (0, 1).
    # A larger input to sigmoid results in a value closer to 1.
    # A smaller input results in a value closer to 0.

    # Let's adjust the input to sigmoid to reflect our priorities.
    # We want high priority for bins where (bins_remain_cap - item) is small and positive.
    # And we want lower priority where (bins_remain_cap - item) is negative or very large positive.
    
    # For bins where item fits (bins_remain_cap >= item):
    # The "gap" (bins_remain_cap - item) determines the "snugness".
    # A smaller gap is better. We can use something like 1 / (1 + gap) or sigmoid of negative gap.
    
    # Let's try a simpler approach:
    # Priority = Sigmoid( (bins_remain_cap - item) * k_fit + bins_remain_cap * k_capacity )
    # k_fit: Controls sensitivity to how well the item fits. Higher k_fit means more penalty for poor fits.
    # k_capacity: Controls sensitivity to remaining capacity. Higher k_capacity means prioritizing fuller bins more.

    k_fit = 0.5  # Sensitivity to the fit. Larger values penalize poor fits more.
    k_capacity = 0.1 # Sensitivity to remaining capacity. Larger values prefer more open bins.
    
    # Calculate scores. Only consider bins where the item fits.
    fits = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For bins where it fits, calculate a combined score
    # High priority for small remaining capacity after fitting (tight fit)
    # High priority for large remaining capacity overall (future flexibility)
    
    # A simple approach could be:
    # Priority for fitting bins: A high score if remaining_cap - item is small and positive
    # A low score if remaining_cap - item is large and positive.
    
    # Let's use a logistic function where the input represents a combination
    # of how much space is left after placing the item and the total remaining space.
    
    # Option 1: Favor tight fits, but don't entirely ignore bins with more space.
    # Map (bins_remain_cap - item) to a "goodness of fit" score.
    # Small positive difference = good.
    # Large positive difference = okay.
    # Negative difference = bad.
    
    # We can use a sigmoid on the inverse of the remaining capacity after placement.
    # If remaining_cap - item is small, then 1 / (remaining_cap - item) is large.
    # If remaining_cap - item is large, then 1 / (remaining_cap - item) is small.
    
    # To handle the case where item does not fit, we set priority to 0.
    # For bins that fit, we want to prioritize those with `bins_remain_cap - item` closer to 0.
    # Also, having `bins_remain_cap` itself not too large might be good to avoid creating
    # bins with too much empty space.
    
    # Let's define a preference for bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is minimized.
    # We can use the sigmoid function on a term that decreases as (bins_remain_cap - item) increases.
    
    # Consider the "waste" if we place the item: bins_remain_cap - item.
    # We want to minimize this waste for a perfect fit, but we also want
    # bins with larger `bins_remain_cap` to be considered if the waste isn't too large.
    
    # A score that prioritizes bins where (bins_remain_cap - item) is small and positive.
    # Let's try sigmoid(- (bins_remain_cap - item) * 0.5 + bins_remain_cap * 0.05)
    
    # This formula will give higher values for:
    # 1. Bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive (due to the negative sign on this term)
    # 2. Bins where `bins_remain_cap` is large (due to the positive sign on this term)
    
    # Let's refine: We want a higher score if `bins_remain_cap` is large enough to fit the item,
    # and within those, we prefer those that result in less remaining capacity after fitting.
    # This means `bins_remain_cap - item` should be as small as possible, but non-negative.
    
    # Let's use the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item as input to sigmoid.
    # This favors bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small (i.e., a tight fit).
    # We also want to consider the overall remaining capacity to some extent.
    
    # Option: Sigmoid of a function that decreases with (bins_remain_cap - item)
    # and increases with bins_remain_cap.
    
    # Let's combine two aspects:
    # 1. How well the item fits (smaller remainder is better).
    # 2. How much total capacity is left (larger might be good for future items).
    
    # Consider the term `bins_remain_cap - item`. We want this to be close to zero, but positive.
    # Let's use `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item))` which gives higher values for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Then, apply sigmoid to scale these values and the overall remaining capacity.
    
    # Final idea: Prioritize bins where the item fits, and among those,
    # prefer bins that have less remaining space *after* placing the item.
    # This encourages filling bins efficiently.
    
    # We want `bins_remain_cap - item` to be small and non-negative.
    # `sigmoid( -(bins_remain_cap - item) )` would do this.
    # However, we also want to prefer bins that generally have more capacity
    # for future items, but not excessively so that it leads to too many half-empty bins.
    
    # Let's try this: Sigmoid on the term that captures "snugness".
    # A bin is a good candidate if `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Among fitting bins, a higher score for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    
    # Use a scaling factor to control the steepness of the sigmoid curve.
    # `scale = 1.0` makes the transition around 0.
    # We want to map `bins_remain_cap - item` such that values near 0
    # result in high priority.
    
    # Let's use `np.exp(-bins_remain_cap / C)`. Higher `bins_remain_cap` -> lower score.
    # This is for the "fill them up" strategy.
    
    # For the "first fit decreasing" or "best fit" idea, we want a tight fit.
    # `sigmoid(-(bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small (tight fit), the argument is close to 0, sigmoid is ~0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large negative (item too big), argument is large positive, sigmoid is ~1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive (loose fit), argument is large negative, sigmoid is ~0.
    
    # This is the inverse of what we want. We want higher priority for tight fits.
    
    # Try: `sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive (tight fit), sigmoid argument is small positive, ~0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive (loose fit), sigmoid argument is large positive, ~1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative (won't fit), sigmoid argument is negative, ~0.
    
    # This seems to align better with favoring bins with less remaining capacity after placement.
    # The `k` parameter controls how sensitive we are to the "tightness".
    # `k=1.0` gives sigmoid(0) = 0.5 for a perfect fit.
    
    # Let's add a slight preference for bins that have *some* space left,
    # to avoid immediately creating many bins with no room left.
    # Maybe `sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item) + c * bins_remain_cap)`
    
    # Let's consider the goal: fill bins optimally.
    # A good bin is one that can accommodate the item and leaves minimal remaining space.
    # `remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item`
    # We want `remaining_after_fit` to be small and non-negative.
    
    # Consider a function `f(x)` where `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want `f(x)` to be high when `x` is small and non-negative.
    # `f(x) = exp(-x / scale)` for `x >= 0`, and `0` otherwise.
    # Then scale this with sigmoid.
    
    # Calculate how much space would be left if we put the item in.
    space_left = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Create a "fit score" that is high for small, non-negative `space_left`.
    # We'll use the negative of `space_left` to map "small positive" to "large positive"
    # for the sigmoid input.
    # If `space_left` is negative (item doesn't fit), we want a very low priority.
    # So, we can use a very large negative number for sigmoid input.
    
    fit_input = np.where(space_left >= 0, -space_left, -1e9) # Penalize items that don't fit
    
    # We can also incorporate a term related to the absolute remaining capacity.
    # Perhaps bins that are already quite full (but can still fit the item) are prioritized.
    # Let's consider the *normalized* remaining capacity as a secondary factor.
    # However, this can be tricky without knowing the overall bin capacity limit.
    # Assuming a standard bin capacity (e.g., 100):
    
    # Let's stick to the primary goal: tight fits.
    # The input to sigmoid: `k * (-space_left)`
    # `k` controls the sensitivity to tightness.
    # `k = 1.0` -> `sigmoid(-space_left)`
    # If `space_left` is 0 (perfect fit), sigmoid(0) = 0.5
    # If `space_left` is 1 (loose fit), sigmoid(-1) = ~0.27
    # If `space_left` is 5 (very loose), sigmoid(-5) = ~0.0067
    # If `space_left` is -1 (item too big), fit_input is -1e9, sigmoid(-1e9) = ~0.
    
    # This seems to prioritize bins with smaller positive remaining space.
    # Let's call this `best_fit_score`.
    
    # What if we also want to slightly favor bins that have a lot of capacity,
    # but only if they *also* provide a relatively good fit?
    # This is where it gets tricky to combine with sigmoid elegantly.
    
    # For a pure "Best Fit" heuristic, `sigmoid(- (bins_remain_cap - item))` is good.
    # We can adjust the steepness with a multiplier.
    
    # Let's go with a strong bias towards best fit, modulated by the possibility of filling a bin.
    # The score should be higher if `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive.
    
    # Consider a function `f(x)` where `x = bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want to give a higher score if `x` is moderately large, but also
    # if `x - item` is small.
    
    # Let's simplify: Prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap` is just enough to fit the item.
    # The value `bins_remain_cap - item` should be small and positive.
    # `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item))` for items that fit.
    
    # Transform `bins_remain_cap - item` into a score:
    # Items that fit: prioritize small, positive `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Items that don't fit: zero priority.
    
    # Let's create a term that peaks when `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive.
    # Gaussian-like function centered around 0?
    # `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item)**2 / sigma**2)`
    # This would favor fits near 0, but also loose fits equally to tight fits if `bins_remain_cap` is the same.
    
    # Best fit strategy is essentially minimizing `bins_remain_cap - item` for `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # We can use sigmoid for this.
    # `sigmoid( -(bins_remain_cap - item) * sensitivity)`
    # Sensitivity controls how sharply we drop off for looser fits.
    
    sensitivity = 2.0 # Higher sensitivity for tighter fits
    
    # Calculate the argument for the sigmoid function.
    # For bins where the item fits (bins_remain_cap >= item), the argument is
    # `-(bins_remain_cap - item) * sensitivity`.
    # This means a tight fit (small positive `bins_remain_cap - item`) gives an argument close to 0,
    # resulting in a sigmoid score close to 0.5.
    # A loose fit (large positive `bins_remain_cap - item`) gives a large negative argument,
    # resulting in a score close to 0.
    # An item that doesn't fit (`bins_remain_cap < item`) means `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative.
    # So, `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` is positive. This gives a score close to 1.
    # This is the opposite of what we want: items that don't fit should have zero priority.
    
    # Let's correct the logic: we want higher priority for bins where the item FITS and leaves less space.
    # Input to sigmoid should be *higher* for better bins.
    
    # Let `y = bins_remain_cap`. We want to maximize a function that is high when `y >= item`
    # and `y - item` is small.
    
    # Consider `score = sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # if `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
    #   If `bins_remain_cap - item = 0` (perfect fit), score = sigmoid(0) = 0.5
    #   If `bins_remain_cap - item = 10` (loose fit), score = sigmoid(10k)
    # if `bins_remain_cap < item`:
    #   score = sigmoid(<negative value>) -> close to 0.
    
    # This means loose fits get higher scores than perfect fits if `k` is negative.
    # If `k` is positive, perfect fits get higher scores.
    
    # Let's try `k = -1.0` (Best Fit - minimizes remaining capacity).
    # `priorities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-sensitivity * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # For `bins_remain_cap - item = 0`: `sigmoid(0)` = 0.5
    # For `bins_remain_cap - item = 10`: `sigmoid(-10)` ~ 0.000045
    # For `bins_remain_cap - item = -1`: `sigmoid(1)` ~ 0.73
    # This still prioritizes items that don't fit.
    
    # The simplest way to handle "does not fit" is to zero out their score.
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    fits = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For bins where the item fits, we want to prioritize those with minimal `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # The function `sigmoid(C * (bins_remain_cap - item))` does the following:
    # - If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative (item too big), input is negative, sigmoid ~0.
    # - If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive (tight fit), input is small positive, sigmoid ~0.5.
    # - If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive (loose fit), input is large positive, sigmoid ~1.
    
    # This seems to be prioritizing loose fits if C > 0.
    # If C < 0, it prioritizes tight fits.
    
    # Let's use C < 0 for best fit.
    # C = -1.0
    # The argument will be `- (bins_remain_cap - item)`.
    # This is equivalent to `(item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # We want to prioritize small values of `item - bins_remain_cap` (i.e., `bins_remain_cap - item` close to 0).
    
    # Consider the score `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`.
    # `k` is sensitivity. Higher `k` means more pronounced difference.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is small positive (tight fit), `sigmoid` is ~0.5.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is large positive (loose fit), `sigmoid` is ~1.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is negative (item too big), `sigmoid` is ~0.
    
    # This is again prioritizing loose fits.
    
    # Okay, let's try a different approach to map `bins_remain_cap - item` to a priority score.
    # We want to map [0, large_positive] to [high_priority, low_priority].
    # A simple mapping is `1 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap - item) / scale)`.
    # This is similar to sigmoid's shape.
    
    # Let's use sigmoid on `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` which is `item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap = 0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0)` = 0.5
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap = 10` (loose fit): `sigmoid(10k)`
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap = -10` (item too big): `sigmoid(-10k)`
    
    # Let `k = 1.0`.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is small positive (tight fit), sigmoid(small_pos) ~ 0.5
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is large positive (loose fit), sigmoid(large_pos) ~ 1.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is negative (item too big), sigmoid(negative) ~ 0.
    
    # This appears to prioritize loose fits over tight fits.
    
    # Let's redefine our objective:
    # We are designing a priority function for the *selection* of a bin.
    # Higher priority means it's *more likely* to be chosen.
    
    # We want to favor bins that are "good".
    # A good bin is one that can fit the item and has minimal space left over.
    # The value `bins_remain_cap - item` should be minimized, subject to `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    
    # We can use `sigmoid` to map the "badness" (`bins_remain_cap - item`) to a score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is 0, we want a high score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive, we want a low score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative, we want a score of 0.
    
    # Consider `sigmoid(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` where `k > 0`.
    # `k=1`:
    # `bins_remain_cap - item = 0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0)` = 0.5
    # `bins_remain_cap - item = 10` (loose fit): `sigmoid(-10)` ~ 0.000045
    # `bins_remain_cap - item = -1` (too big): `sigmoid(1)` ~ 0.73
    
    # Still a problem with items that don't fit.
    # Let's enforce the "fits" condition first by zeroing out scores.
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For bins that fit, calculate a "fit quality" score.
    # Higher score for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    
    # Let's use `sigmoid(C * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
    # This maps `item - bins_remain_cap` to a [0, 1] range.
    # `item - bins_remain_cap` = `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`
    
    # We want `bins_remain_cap - item` to be small and positive.
    # This means `item - bins_remain_cap` should be small and negative.
    
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want to map `[0, large_pos]` to `[high_score, low_score]`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + x / scale)` or `sigmoid(log(x / scale))` could work.
    
    # Let's use the direct property of sigmoid: `sigmoid(z)` increases from 0 to 1 as `z` increases.
    # We want a higher score for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # This means we want the argument to sigmoid to be smaller as `bins_remain_cap - item` increases.
    # So, the argument should be proportional to `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.

    # Consider a scenario where we want to distinguish between bins that become very empty

    # The current `1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` assigns higher priority to smaller `fits`.
    
    # To implement "Almost Full Fit" more explicitly, we can penalize bins that become too empty.
    # If `fits[i]` is large, it means the bin is left very empty.
    # We want to favor bins where `fits[i]` is small but positive.
    
    # Let's adjust the priority to give a boost to bins that are *closer* to being full.
    # The `1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` already does this.
    
    # Alternative approach: Prioritize bins based on how much capacity *remains*.
    # The "Almost Full Fit" strategy suggests that we prefer to put an item into a bin
    # such that the remaining capacity is minimized, but the item still fits.
    # This means we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # Therefore, bins with smaller `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` should have higher priority.

    # get a high priority if they leave a small remainder.
    
    # The current `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` directly implements
    # favoring the tightest fit among those that can accommodate the item. This is a core aspect
    # of "Almost Full Fit".
    
    # To make it more "almost full" specific, we could perhaps add a bonus for bins whose
    # original capacity (if we knew it) was already somewhat occupied. But we only have remaining capacity.
    
    # Let's refine the priority: High priority for tight fits.
    # If a bin has `bins_remain_cap[i] = 5` and item is `3`, `fits = 2`. Priority `1/2`.
    # If a bin has `bins_remain_cap[i] = 10` and item is `3`, `fits = 7`. Priority `1/7`.
    # This correctly prioritizes the bin that becomes "more full" or "less empty".
    
    # What if we also want to prioritize bins that are already relatively full *before* the item is placed?
    # This is implicit if the remaining capacity is small.
    
    # Let's consider a slightly different metric. Maybe a bonus for being "close" to full.
    # How to define "close"?
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is small, the bin is already somewhat full.
    
    # Let's try a two-part heuristic:
    # 1. Prioritize bins that are "almost full" by looking at their current `bins_remain_cap`.
    # 2. Among those, pick the tightest fit.
    
    # Heuristic idea: Priority = (small_remaining_capacity) + (tight_fit_score)
    
    # Let's define a penalty for bins that are very empty.
    # For `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:
    # Priority contribution from being "almost full": maybe `1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] + epsilon)`
    # Priority contribution from "tight fit": `1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon)`
    
    # If we simply prioritize the tightest fit, `1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` is good.
    # This means if an item is 5:
    # Bin A: remaining cap 10, fits 5. Priority = 1/5
    # Bin B: remaining cap 7, fits 2. Priority = 1/2
    # Bin C: remaining cap 4, cannot fit. Priority = 0
    # Bin D: remaining cap 6, fits 1. Priority = 1/1
    # Bin E: remaining cap 12, fits 7. Priority = 1/7
    # Order of preference: D, B, A, E. This seems reasonable for "tightest fit".
    
    # For "Almost Full Fit", maybe we want to emphasize bins that *remain* very full.
    # So, a bin with remaining capacity `r` after placement contributes `1/r` to priority.
    # What if we also consider the initial state?
    # Bin X: initial rem cap 10, item 7, fits 3. Initial rel cap 10/TOTAL_CAP. Final rel cap 3/TOTAL_CAP.
    # Bin Y: initial rem cap 20, item 7, fits 13. Initial rel cap 20/TOTAL_CAP. Final rel cap 13/TOTAL_CAP.
    
    # Let's reconsider the "Almost Full" aspect. It's about the state *after* packing.
    # A bin is "almost full" if its remaining capacity is small.
    # The most "almost full" state is achieved when the item *just fits*, i.e., `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimal and non-negative.
    
    # A common way to implement "Almost Full Fit" is to maximize the probability of a bin becoming full.
    # This means minimizing the remaining capacity after placing the item.
    
    # Let's think about what would make a bin *less* desirable.
    # 1. Not having enough capacity for the item.
    # 2. Having a lot of remaining capacity after placing the item (i.e., becoming very empty).
    
    # So, we want bins with `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item` and `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` as small as possible.
    # This is precisely what `1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` does.
    
    # However, to be "Almost Full", perhaps we should also give some preference based on the *original* remaining capacity.
    # If we have two bins that yield the same `fits` value, which one do we prefer?
    # E.g., Item 3.
    # Bin 1: remaining 10, fits 7. Priority 1/7
    # Bin 2: remaining 20, fits 17. Priority 1/17.
    # Bin 1 is preferred. This is correct.
    
    # What if the problem intends to bias towards bins that were *already* closer to full?
    # If we consider two bins that both fit the item and result in the same remaining capacity `r`.
    # Bin A: initial remaining cap `r + item`.
    # Bin B: initial remaining cap `r + item`.
    # In this case, the current priority function would give them the same score.
    
    # To incorporate "Almost Full" more distinctly, let's introduce a term that rewards smaller *initial* remaining capacities, but only if the item fits.
    
    # Priority = (tightness_score) * (initial_fill_score)
    # Tightness score: `1 / (fits + epsilon)`
    # Initial fill score: A measure of how full the bin was initially.
    # This can be `1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] + epsilon)`.
    
    # Let's try:
    # `priority[i] = 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon) * 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] + epsilon)`
    
    # Let's test this with item 3:
    # Bin A: remaining 10, fits 7. Initial 10. Priority = (1/7) * (1/10) = 1/70
    # Bin B: remaining 7, fits 4. Initial 7. Priority = (1/4) * (1/7) = 1/28
    # Bin C: remaining 6, fits 3. Initial 6. Priority = (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18
    # Bin D: remaining 5, fits 2. Initial 5. Priority = (1/2) * (1/5) = 1/10
    # Bin E: remaining 12, fits 9. Initial 12. Priority = (1/9) * (1/12) = 1/108
    
    # Order of preference: D, C, B, A, E.
    # This prioritizes bins that were initially more full AND result in a tighter fit.
    # This seems to capture "Almost Full Fit" well.
    
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = (1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)) * (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))
    
    # However, the term `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` favors bins that are *currently* almost full, irrespective of how the item fits.
    # The core of "Almost Full Fit" is about the state *after* the item is placed.
    # A bin is "almost full" if its remaining capacity is small.
    # So the priority should be directly related to `fits`.
    
    # Let's reconsider the first interpretation: prioritize the tightest fit.
    # `priority[i] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon)` for `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`.
    
    # If "Almost Full Fit" means we want to avoid creating *very empty* bins, then small positive `fits` are good.
    
    # Let's re-evaluate the phrasing: "pack an item as soon as it is received" and "smallest number of fixed-sized bins".
    # The goal is to minimize the number of bins. This means making each bin as full as possible before opening a new one.
    # "Almost Full Fit" suggests that when placing an item, we want to move a bin closer to being "full".
    # A bin is closer to being full if its remaining capacity is reduced.
    # The greatest reduction happens with the tightest fit.
    
    # Consider a scenario:
    # Bin 1: remaining capacity 10. Item 7. Fits 3.
    # Bin 2: remaining capacity 10. Item 4. Fits 6.
    # We have item 3.
    # If we place item 3 in Bin 1: remaining becomes 7.
    # If we place item 3 in Bin 2: remaining becomes 7.
    # The current priority `1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` would give both the same priority (1/7).
    
    # If "Almost Full Fit" implies a preference for bins that are *already* somewhat occupied, we could consider the current remaining capacity.
    # Let's try prioritizing bins based on their remaining capacity first, then tightness.
    # Or combine them.
    
    # Heuristic v2.1: Prioritize by tightest fit, but add a slight bonus if the bin is currently quite full.
    # `priority = (1 / (fits + epsilon)) + (some_bonus_if_bins_remain_cap_is_small)`
    
    # Let's define "quite full" as `bins_remain_cap[i] < Threshold`.
    # This threshold would typically be related to the bin capacity, which we don't have.
    
    # Simpler approach: the inverse of `fits` is the primary driver.
    # To emphasize "almost full", perhaps we should ensure that bins with *large* `fits` get very low priority.
    # The current inverse already does this.
    
    # Let's refine `priority_v1`'s basic idea: `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)`
    # This maximizes the usage of bins.
    
    # How can we make it more "Almost Full"?
    # Maybe a different transformation of `fits`.
    # E.g., `exp(-k * fits)` for some `k > 0`. This gives higher priority to smaller `fits`.
    # If `fits` is large, `exp(-k * fits)` is small.
    # If `fits` is small positive, `exp(-k * fits)` is close to 1.
    # If `fits` is 0, `exp(0) = 1`.
    
    # Let's consider the difference `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want small positive values for this.
    
    # Let's try to model the "desirability" of a bin.
    # Desirable bins are:
    # 1. Capable of holding the item.
    # 2. When the item is placed, the remaining capacity is minimized.
    # 3. (Perhaps) The bin was already not excessively empty before placing the item.
    
    # The original formulation `1.0 / (fits + epsilon)` addresses #1 and #2 directly.
    # If item=3, bins_rem_cap = [10, 7, 6, 5, 12]
    # fits = [7, 4, 3, 2, 9]
    # prios = [1/7, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1/9]
    
    # If we want to emphasize the "almost full" aspect, maybe we should square the priority?
    # Or raise it to a power greater than 1?
    # Let's try: `priorities[can_fit_mask] = (1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))**2`
    # This would make the preference for tighter fits even stronger.
    # With item=3:
    # fits = [7, 4, 3, 2, 9]
    # prios_v1 = [0.14, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.11]
    # prios_squared = [0.02, 0.0625, 0.11, 0.25, 0.012]
    # The order remains the same, but the differences are amplified.
    
    # This emphasizes the tightest fit even more. This IS a good interpretation of "Almost Full Fit".
    # It means we are really pushing to fill bins to capacity, minimizing wasted space.
    
    # Let's consider what happens if `fits` are negative. Our `can_fit_mask` handles this.
    
    # What if `bins_remain_cap[i]` is large, say 1000, and item is 3. `fits = 997`. Priority = 1/997.
    # If another bin has `bins_remain_cap[i] = 5` and item is 3. `fits = 2`. Priority = 1/2.
    # The bin with initial capacity 5 is correctly prioritized if it's a tighter fit.
    
    # Could there be a case where we want to prefer a bin that has a lot of capacity left,
    # if the item is very small and many bins are only slightly occupied?
    # The "Almost Full Fit" implies the opposite: we prefer bins that are ALMOST full.
    # So, the current formulation where we reward small `fits` seems correct.
    
    # Let's use the `1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` as the core idea.
    # To make it more "Almost Full", perhaps we should consider how "full" the bin was BEFORE the item was placed.
    # If a bin has remaining capacity R, its "fullness" could be considered 1 - R/TotalCapacity.
    # Since we don't have TotalCapacity, we can use a relative measure, or just use R directly.
    # Bins with smaller R are "more full".
    
    # Let's try a combined priority:
    # Primary driver: Tightness of fit (minimize remaining space).
    # Secondary driver: Current "fullness" of the bin (prefer less empty bins).
    
    # Combine them using multiplication or addition.
    # If addition: `priority = (1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)) + (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))`
    # Item=3:
    # fits=[7, 4, 3, 2, 9], bins_rem_cap=[10, 7, 6, 5, 12]
    # P1 = 1/fits: [0.14, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.11]
    # P2 = 1/bins_rem_cap: [0.10, 0.14, 0.17, 0.20, 0.08]
    # Sum = P1+P2:
    # Bin 1 (10): 0.14 + 0.10 = 0.24
    # Bin 2 (7):  0.25 + 0.14 = 0.39
    # Bin 3 (6):  0.33 + 0.17 = 0.50
    # Bin 4 (5):  0.50 + 0.20 = 0.70
    # Bin 5 (12): 0.11 + 0.08 = 0.19
    # Order: 4, 3, 2, 1, 5.
    # This prioritizes the tightest fit first (Bin 4), and among equally tight fits (not present here), it would prefer the one that was more full initially.
    
    # Let's consider two bins with item 3:
    # Bin A: rem_cap=7, fits=4. P1=0.25, P2=0.14. Sum=0.39
    # Bin B: rem_cap=10, fits=7. P1=0.14, P2=0.10. Sum=0.24
    # Bin A is preferred. This is good.
    
    # Consider two bins where the 'fits' are the same: Item=3.
    # Bin X: rem_cap=5, fits=2. P1=0.5, P2=0.2. Sum=0.7
    # Bin Y: rem_cap=8, fits=2. P1=0.5, P2=0.125. Sum=0.625
    # Bin X is preferred. This is good because it was more full initially.
    
    # This additive approach `(1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)) + (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))`
    # seems to balance both criteria for "Almost Full Fit": the tightest fit, and preferring bins that are already substantially occupied.
    
    # Let's check potential issues:
    # If `bins_remain_cap` is very small (e.g., 1) and item is small (e.g., 0.5).
    # fits = 0.5. bins_remain_cap = 1.
    # P1 = 1/0.5 = 2. P2 = 1/1 = 1. Sum = 3.
    
    # If `bins_remain_cap` is very large, e.g., 100, item is 3.
    # fits = 97. bins_remain_cap = 100.
    # P1 = 1/97 ≈ 0.01. P2 = 1/100 = 0.01. Sum = 0.02.
    # The priority from the initial fill becomes relatively less impactful when the remaining capacity is large.
    
    # The relative scaling of the two terms might be important.
    # If we want to emphasize tightness more, we could multiply by a factor.
    # `priority = A * (1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)) + B * (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))`
    
    # For now, let's use a simple additive combination with equal weights.
    # This is `priority_v2`'s implementation.
    
    # Let's reconsider the multiplicative approach:
    # `priorities[can_fit_mask] = (1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)) * (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))`
    # Item=3:
    # fits=[7, 4, 3, 2, 9], bins_rem_cap=[10, 7, 6, 5, 12]
    # P1 = 1/fits: [0.14, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.11]
    # P2 = 1/bins_rem_cap: [0.10, 0.14, 0.17, 0.20, 0.08]
    # Prod = P1 * P2:
    # Bin 1 (10): 0.14 * 0.10 = 0.014
    # Bin 2 (7):  0.25 * 0.14 = 0.035
    # Bin 3 (6):  0.33 * 0.17 ≈ 0.056
    # Bin 4 (5):  0.50 * 0.20 = 0.10
    # Bin 5 (12): 0.11 * 0.08 ≈ 0.009
    # Order: 4, 3, 2, 1, 5.
    # The multiplicative version prioritizes bins where *both* criteria are met strongly.
    # It punishes bins that are either not a tight fit OR were very empty initially.
    # The additive version might prefer a bin that is slightly less tight but much fuller initially.
    
    # The term "Almost Full Fit" suggests focusing on the state *after* fitting.
    # So, `1 / fits` is the most direct representation of "how close to full after fitting".
    # The "Almost Full" part implies we want to reduce wasted space, which is precisely what `1/fits` prioritizes for positive `fits`.
    
    # What if the problem means "prefer bins that will *become* almost full", but with some consideration for the initial state?
    
    # Let's simplify and go back to the core idea of "tightest fit".
    # The strategy is "Almost Full Fit". This means we want to pack items such that bins get as full as possible.
    # When placing an item, we want to choose a bin where the item fits, and the remaining capacity is minimized.
    # So, minimize `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # Maximizing `1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon)` for `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item` is the most direct implementation of this.
    
    # Let's re-evaluate the "priority" concept. The bin with the HIGHEST priority score is selected.
    
    # Final consideration: the definition of "Almost Full Fit".
    # It's often interpreted as preferring bins with the smallest positive slack `s_i = C - x_i - item_j` where `C` is bin capacity.
    # This translates to minimizing `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # The function `f(x) = 1/x` is monotonically decreasing for x>0.
    # So maximizing `1 / (slack + epsilon)` means minimizing `slack`.
    
    # The question is whether there's an additional component related to the *initial* remaining capacity.
    # If the goal is to minimize the number of bins, then making each bin as full as possible is the key.
    # This implies minimizing `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    
    # Let's consider a scenario where `TotalCapacity = 10`.
    # Item = 3.
    # Bin A: rem_cap = 5. Item fits (remaining 2). Priority (1/2). Initial fullness ~50%. Final fullness ~70%.
    # Bin B: rem_cap = 10. Item fits (remaining 7). Priority (1/7). Initial fullness ~0%. Final fullness ~30%.
    # Bin A is clearly preferred.
    
    # What if the item is 2?
    # Bin A: rem_cap = 5. Item fits (remaining 3). Priority (1/3). Initial fullness ~50%. Final fullness ~70%.
    # Bin B: rem_cap = 10. Item fits (remaining 8). Priority (1/8). Initial fullness ~0%. Final fullness ~20%.
    # Bin A is still preferred.
    
    # What if item = 8?
    # Bin A: rem_cap = 10. Item fits (remaining 2). Priority (1/2). Initial fullness ~0%. Final fullness ~20%.
    # Bin B: rem_cap = 5. Item does not fit. Priority 0.
    # Bin A is preferred.
    
    # The function `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (fits[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)` seems to be the most direct interpretation of "tightest fit" or "minimizing remaining space".
    
    # Let's consider if there's a specific way to make it *more* "almost full".
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is very close to `item`, that bin is "almost full" relative to the item size.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is much larger than `item`, the bin is less "almost full" in this sense.
    
    # Maybe a term that favors bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] / item` is small?
    # This would be `item / bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    
    # Let's try `priority = (1.0 / (fits + epsilon)) * (item / bins_remain_cap)` for bins that can fit.
    # Item=3:
    # fits=[7, 4, 3, 2, 9], bins_rem_cap=[10, 7, 6, 5, 12]
    # P1 = 1/fits: [0.14, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.11]
    # P2 = item/bins_rem_cap: [3/10, 3/7, 3/6, 3/5, 3/12] = [0.3, 0.43, 0.5, 0.6, 0.25]
    # Prod = P1 * P2:
    # Bin 1 (10): 0.14 * 0.3 = 0.042
    # Bin 2 (7):  0.25 * 0.43 = 0.1075
    # Bin 3 (6):  0.33 * 0.5 = 0.165
    # Bin 4 (5):  0.50 * 0.6 = 0.30
    # Bin 5 (12): 0.11 * 0.25 = 0.0275
    # Order: 4, 3, 2, 1, 5.
    # This is the same order as before. This function emphasizes bins that are both tight fitting AND where the bin had less room to begin with (relative to item size).
    
    # This combination seems robust. Let's use the multiplicative form.

    # A simple sigmoid: 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))
    # This function will be near 0 for ratios < x0 and near 1 for ratios > x0.
    # We want the opposite: high score for ratios close to x0.
    # So let's use: exp(-k * abs(ratios - x0))
    # Or a sigmoid where the center is x0 and it decays away from it.
    # A Gaussian-like shape could work: exp(- (ratios - x0)^2 / (2 * sigma^2))
    # But we are asked to use Sigmoid Fit Score strategy.

    # Let's use a sigmoid that peaks at x0 and decays on both sides.
    # This can be achieved by combining two sigmoids or using a logistic function with a central shift.
    # A simpler approach is to use the sigmoid's property of mapping to [0, 1] and
    # transform it.

    # Let's use a standard sigmoid: sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z)).
    # We want higher values when `ratios` is close to `x0`.
    # Let's map `ratios` to `z` such that `z=0` when `ratios=x0`.
    # `z = -k * (ratios - x0)`.

    # The steepness 'k' can be tuned. Let's try to make it moderate.
    # A fixed k might be too sensitive. Let's try a k that adapts a bit.
    # For example, k could be related to the average bin fill ratio across all bins.
    # For now, let's pick a reasonable fixed k.
    k = 5.0 # Controls the steepness of the sigmoid. Higher k means a sharper peak.

    # Calculate the sigmoid value. This will be close to 0 for ratios < x0 and close to 1 for ratios > x0.
    # We want the opposite: low priority for ratios too small, high for ratios around x0,
    # and medium-high for ratios much larger than x0 (to keep them as fallback).
    # This suggests we are looking for bins that are 'just right'.

    # Let's consider the "distance" from the ideal ratio `x0`.
    # We want bins where `ratios` is close to `x0`.
    # Let's re-center the sigmoid: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))`
    # This gives higher values for larger ratios.

    # We want bins that are NOT too full (ratio >= 1).
    # Bins with ratio < 1 should have zero priority.
    # Bins with ratio >= 1, we want to prioritize those closest to `x0`.

    # Let's define a function that is high around `x0` and decreases away.
    # Option 1: Logistic "bump" function: `1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - x0))) * 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))`
    # This is effectively `sech^2(k * (ratios - x0) / 2)`. This is Gaussian-like.

    # Option 2: Two-sided sigmoid approach.
    # If `ratios < x0`, we want priority to increase as `ratios` increases.
    # If `ratios > x0`, we want priority to decrease as `ratios` increases.

    # Let's try mapping the ratio to a value that we can then apply a sigmoid to.
    # We want the "best" fit to be around `item` capacity.
    # Consider the "slack" in the bin: `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want slack to be small but positive.

    # Let's try a sigmoid that models "how suitable" a bin is.
    # For bins with `bins_remain_cap < item`, they are unsuitable. Priority = 0.
    # For bins with `bins_remain_cap >= item`, they are suitable to some degree.
    # Let's focus on `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # We want to give higher scores to bins with `bins_remain_cap` closer to `item`.
    # But also, bins with slightly more capacity than `item` might be better than exact fits.

    # Let's use the original item size `item` as the reference.
    # And `bins_remain_cap` as the actual remaining capacity.
    # We are looking for bins where `bins_remain_cap` is "just enough" but not too much.

    # Let `ideal_cap = item * 1.1` (a bit more than the item itself).
    # And `slack = bins_remain_cap - ideal_cap`.
    # We want to maximize the sigmoid of `-slack`. This means small positive slack is best.

    # To use the sigmoid fitting strategy, we need to map our 'quality' metric
    # to an argument for the sigmoid function.
    # Let's use the ratio `bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to prioritize bins where this ratio is close to 1.0 to 1.2.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Let's use a sigmoid function of the form `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (x - x0)))`.
    # If we want higher values for `x` around `x0`, this standard sigmoid is problematic.

    # Let's reframe: A good bin is one that accepts the item AND leaves a "good" amount of space.
    # "Good" space is relative to the item.

    # Consider a scoring function that rewards bins that are not too full and not too empty.
    # Bins that cannot fit the item get a score of 0.
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # For bins that can fit the item, let's compute a score based on remaining capacity.
    # We want remaining capacity slightly larger than `item`.
    # Let's define a "target remaining capacity" `target_rc`.
    # A reasonable target is `item * 1.2`.
    target_rc = item * 1.2

    # The difference from the target: `bins_remain_cap[can_fit] - target_rc`
    # We want this difference to be close to 0.
    # Let's map this difference using a sigmoid that peaks at 0.
    # `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-difference)))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(k * difference))`.
    # This function is high when `difference` is negative (i.e., `bins_remain_cap` is less than `target_rc`).
    # And low when `difference` is positive. This is the opposite of what we want.

    # We want a function that is high when `difference` is near 0.
    # So, let's consider `exp(-k * (difference)^2)` which is Gaussian.
    # But we need a sigmoid.

    # Let's go back to the ratio `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Target ratio `x0 = 1.2`.
    # We want values close to `x0` to have high priority.
    # Let's try a sigmoid which increases towards `x0` and then decreases after `x0`.
    # This can be seen as `sigmoid(k * (ratios - x0))` where `k` is negative for the decreasing part.
    # This implies `sigmoid_part1 = 1 / (1 + exp(-k1 * (ratios - x0)))` and
    # `sigmoid_part2 = 1 / (1 + exp(k2 * (ratios - x0)))`.
    # Then combine them: `score = sigmoid_part1 * sigmoid_part2`.
    # For a symmetric peak, k1=k2. Let k1 = k2 = k.
    # `score = (1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))) * (1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - x0))))`
    # `score = 1 / ((1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0))) * (1 + exp(k * (ratios - x0))))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*(ratios-x0)) + exp(k*(ratios-x0)) + 1)`
    # `score = 1 / (2 + 2 * cosh(k * (ratios - x0)))`
    # This is proportional to `sech^2`.

    # Let's simplify. We want bins that are "just right".
    # bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. `item` is the item size.
    # The "fit" can be measured by `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want this difference to be small and positive.

    # Let's define `fit_metric = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Target `x0 = 1.2`.
    # Sigmoid: `S(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))`
    # We want high score for `fit_metric` near `x0`.

    # Let's try to model "fit goodness" with a sigmoid.
    # A bin that's too full has a negative value. A bin that's perfectly full has a zero value.
    # A bin that's just right has a small positive value.
    # A bin that's too empty has a large positive value.

    # Let's consider the "filling ratio" if the item is placed: `(bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap_initial`.
    # This is tricky as initial capacity isn't given directly in this function.

    # Let's use the remaining capacity and item size directly.
    # A bin is "good" if `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Among these, we want those where `bins_remain_cap` is closest to `item`.

    # Sigmoid strategy implies using `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` or its variants.
    # We want to map our "goodness" measure to `x`.
    # Let's define a "desirability" score:
    # Bins that cannot fit the item get score 0.
    # For bins that can fit (`bins_remain_cap >= item`):
    # We want higher scores for `bins_remain_cap` closer to `item`.
    # Let `distance_from_ideal = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want to minimize this distance.
    # Let's map `distance_from_ideal` to `z` for a sigmoid.

    # Let's try to get a score that is high for `bins_remain_cap` slightly greater than `item`.
    # Consider `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`.
    # This score increases with `bins_remain_cap`. This favors larger bins.
    # We need to penalize bins that are too large.

    # Let's use the ratio again: `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Target `x0 = 1.2`.
    # Let's consider the "excess capacity ratio": `excess_ratio = (bins_remain_cap - item) / item`.
    # We want `excess_ratio` to be small and positive.
    # Let `y = excess_ratio`. We want peak at `y` near 0.2 (which corresponds to ratio 1.2).
    # A sigmoid that peaks around a value and decreases symmetrically is difficult with a single sigmoid.

    # Let's try a simple sigmoid interpretation that captures "goodness of fit".
    # The sigmoid function is monotonic. So we can use it to express "how likely is this to be a good fit".
    # A common approach is to map a "quality" to the argument of the sigmoid.

    # Let's consider bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # For these bins, let's define a "fit quality" `f`.
    # We want `f` to be higher when `bins_remain_cap` is closer to `item`.
    # Let's use the ratio `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want higher scores for `ratios` around `1.0` to `1.2`.

    # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))`.
    # This score increases with `ratios`. So it favors larger remaining capacities.
    # To favor bins that are "just right", we need a score that drops for larger capacities.

    # Consider a "penalty" for being too empty: `penalty_empty = max(0, item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # Consider a "penalty" for being too full (but still fits): `penalty_full = max(0, bins_remain_cap - item * 1.2)`.
    # We want to minimize penalties.

    # Let's use the Sigmoid Fit Score as a measure of "how well does this bin 'fit' the item
    # in a way that's optimal for future packing."
    # The ideal scenario is a bin that is *almost* full, but not quite.
    # Let's consider bins that have remaining capacity `c`.
    # We are placing an item of size `i`.
    # A bin is a potential candidate if `c >= i`.
    # Among these, we want bins where `c` is "just enough" but not excessively large.

    # Let's use the ratio `c / i`.
    # Target ratio `x0 = 1.2` (meaning bin has 20% spare capacity).
    # A standard sigmoid `S(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))` is increasing.
    # If we use `z = k * (c/i - x0)`, then score increases as `c/i` increases.
    # This isn't quite right, as it rewards large remaining capacities.

    # Let's consider the complement of the standard sigmoid for the "decreasing" part.
    # `1 - S(z) = exp(-z) / (1 + exp(-z))`. This is decreasing.
    # If we want a peak, we can combine two sigmoids:
    # `Score = S(k * (c/i - x0)) * (1 - S(k * (c/i - x0)))` -- this is Gaussian-like.

    # Let's consider a simpler interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score".
    # We want to prioritize bins that are not too full and not too empty.
    # Let's define a "tightness score":
    # `tightness = bins_remain_cap / item`
    # We want tightness to be around `1.0` to `1.2`.
    # Let `ideal_tightness = 1.1`.
    # `z = k * (tightness - ideal_tightness)`
    # A score like `1 / (1 + exp(-z))` favors higher tightness.

    # Let's consider the "waste": `waste = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want waste to be small and positive.
    # Let `waste_score = exp(-k * waste)`. This favors smaller waste.
    # This isn't a sigmoid-fit score though.

    # Let's use a Sigmoid to represent "how well does this bin perform IF it fits".
    # A bin that is too full has poor performance.
    # A bin that is very empty also has poor performance (wasted space).
    # The best performance is for bins that are "just right".

    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want a high score for `r` around `1.0` to `1.2`.
    # Let's use `x0 = 1.1` as the center of our preference.
    # Consider `sigmoid_up = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * (r - x0)))`. This increases with `r`.
    # Consider `sigmoid_down = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * (r - x0)))`. This decreases with `r`.
    # A product could give a peak: `score = sigmoid_up * sigmoid_down`.
    # This would be `1 / (2 + exp(k*(r-x0)) + exp(-k*(r-x0)))`.

    # Let's consider bins that are too small first.
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # For bins that can fit, let's calculate their suitability score.
    # Suitability should be higher for bins with remaining capacity closer to `item`,
    # but slightly larger.
    # Let the target remaining capacity be `target = item * 1.2`.
    target_capacity = item * 1.2

    # We want to maximize a score related to `target_capacity - bins_remain_cap`.
    # Specifically, we want a high score when `target_capacity - bins_remain_cap` is near 0.
    # This is essentially `bins_remain_cap - target_capacity`. We want this to be near 0.
    # Let `diff = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - target_capacity`
    # We want a function that is high for `diff` near 0.
    # Let's use `f(diff) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * diff))`. This peaks at 0 and is decreasing.
    # No, this peaks at 0 and is INCREASING. `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`.
    # `f(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))` means `f` increases with `z`. So if `z = k * diff`, `f` increases with `diff`.
    # This means it favors bins that are LARGER than the target.

    # Let's use `z = k * (target_capacity - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])`.
    # Then `f(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))` will be high when `target_capacity - bins_remain_cap` is positive and large.
    # This favors bins that are SMALLER than the target.

    # We need a function that is high when `bins_remain_cap` is NEAR `target_capacity`.
    # A sigmoid centered at the target capacity is needed for the "goodness".

    # Let's try using `sigmoid(k * (bin_capacity - item))` to favor bins that are not too small.
    # And `sigmoid(k * (item * 1.5 - bin_capacity))` to favor bins that are not too large.
    # Let `target_peak = item * 1.1`.
    # We can use the ratio `r = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to score bins where `r` is near `1.0` to `1.2`.

    # Consider a metric: how "close" is `bins_remain_cap` to `item`?
    # `distance = abs(bins_remain_cap - item)`
    # We want to minimize this distance for bins that can fit.

    # Let's use the sigmoid function directly to represent the desirability of remaining capacity.
    # For a bin to be desirable, it should have capacity `c` such that `item <= c <= item * some_factor`.
    # Let the factor be `F = 1.5`. So we prefer `item <= c <= 1.5 * item`.
    # `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`. We prefer `1.0 <= ratios <= 1.5`.

    # Sigmoid form: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * x))`
    # If we want a score that peaks, it means it increases and then decreases.
    # Let `ideal_ratio = 1.1`.
    # Let `k = 5.0` (controls steepness).

    # Consider the "goodness" metric: `goodness = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to give a higher score to values close to `1.1`.
    # Let `z = k * (goodness - 1.1)`.
    # We want the sigmoid function to evaluate to something high when `z` is close to `0`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(-z))` increases as `z` increases.
    # To get a peak, we need a function that increases and then decreases.
    # This can be achieved by multiplying two sigmoids, or using a bell-shaped curve.
    # A common approach to get a peak using sigmoids is:
    # `score = Sigmoid(k1 * (value - center1)) * Sigmoid(-k2 * (value - center2))`
    # For a symmetric peak, center1 = center2 = `ideal_value`, and `k1 = k2 = k`.
    # `score = Sigmoid(k * (value - ideal_value)) * Sigmoid(-k * (value - ideal_value))`
    # `score = [1 / (1 + exp(-k*(value - ideal_value)))] * [1 / (1 + exp(k*(value - ideal_value)))]`

    # Let's apply this:
    # `value = bins_remain_cap / item`
    # `ideal_value = 1.1` (meaning we prefer bins with 10% more capacity than the item)
    # `k = 5.0` (controls how sharp the peak is)

    # First, handle cases where `item` is zero or negative (although problem implies positive sizes).
    if item <= 1e-9:
        # If item size is negligible, all bins are equally suitable.
        # Prioritize bins with less remaining capacity to encourage packing tighter.
        # A simple approach is to return the inverse of remaining capacity, normalized.
        # Or just return a flat score, as any bin will do.
        # For consistency with the sigmoid idea, let's give a high score to less filled bins.
        # Let's return a score based on how much capacity is LEFT, inversely.
        # The flatter the capacity, the better it is for future items.
        # So, a higher score for bins with LESS remaining capacity.
        # We want a high score for smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
        # Let's use sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-bins_remain_cap)))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`.
        # This decreases with `bins_remain_cap`. So we need the inverse: `1 - 1 / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`
        # which is `exp(k * bins_remain_cap) / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`. This increases with capacity.
        # We want to prioritize LESS capacity.
        # Let's use sigmoid on inverse capacity: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-bins_remain_cap)))` where `k` is positive.
        # So, `1 / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`.
        # To prioritize LESS remaining capacity, we want this score to be HIGH for small bins_remain_cap.
        # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * x))` decreases with x. So this works.
        # However, we are trying to PACK an item. If item is 0, it doesn't need packing.
        # Let's return zeros, or perhaps a preference for the most empty bins to leave room for larger items.
        # For the problem statement (packing an item), a zero item doesn't need placing.
        # However, if we interpret it as "if there's a zero item, which bin is most 'optimal' to put it in",
        # it might be the least filled bin.
        # Let's return a score that is higher for bins with less remaining capacity.
        # `priorities = 1.0 - bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)` is simple, but not sigmoid.
        # `priorities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(5 * bins_remain_cap))`. This decreases as capacity increases.
        # Let's just return a constant high value, indicating all are equally good for a null item.
        return np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap) * 0.5 # Mid-range preference, not too full, not too empty.

    ratios = bins_remain_cap / item
    ideal_ratio = 1.1  # Target: bin capacity should be 1.1 times the item size.
    k = 5.0          # Steepness parameter for the sigmoid.

    # Calculate the first sigmoid component: favors ratios less than or equal to ideal_ratio.
    # `sigmoid_up = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))`
    # This score is high when `ratios - ideal_ratio` is positive, i.e., ratios > ideal_ratio.
    # We want high score when `ratios` is NOT too large.
    # So, let's use `1 - sigmoid(k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))`
    # which is `exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)) / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))`.
    # This is `sigmoid(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))`.
    sigmoid_part1 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))) # High for ratios > ideal_ratio

    # Calculate the second sigmoid component: favors ratios greater than or equal to ideal_ratio.
    # We want high score when `ratios` is NOT too small (i.e., >= item).
    # `sigmoid_down = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))`
    # This score is high when `ratios - ideal_ratio` is negative, i.e., ratios < ideal_ratio.
    # We want to prioritize bins that can fit the item (`ratios >= 1`).
    # So, let's use this to favor ratios closer to ideal_ratio from below.
    sigmoid_part2 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))) # High for ratios < ideal_ratio

    # Combine the two: the product will be high only when both sigmoids are moderately high.
    # This creates a peak around `ideal_ratio`.
    priorities = sigmoid_part1 * sigmoid_part2

    # Ensure that bins that cannot fit the item (bins_remain_cap < item) get zero priority.
    # This means `ratios < 1`.
    # For `ratios < 1`, `ratios - ideal_ratio` is negative and large.
    # `sigmoid_part1` will be close to 0. `sigmoid_part2` will be close to 1.
    # The product `priorities` will be close to 0. This is good.

    # Let's refine the "ideal_ratio". It should ideally be related to `item` size.
    # A larger `k` makes the peak narrower and higher.
    # The product `sigmoid_part1 * sigmoid_part2` creates a bell-like shape.
    # `sigmoid_part1` increases with `ratios`. `sigmoid_part2` decreases with `ratios`.
    # The peak is at `ratios = ideal_ratio`.

    # Let's reconsider the core idea: Sigmoid Fit Score.
    # This should capture how well the item *fits*.
    # A tight fit is good, but not if it leaves no room.
    # An excess of room is also not ideal (wasted space).
    # The "perfect" fit leaves minimal, but positive, remaining space.

    # Let's use a single sigmoid to represent the "quality of space left".
    # `remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want this to be positive and small.
    # Let `ideal_remaining_space = item * 0.1` (10% of item size).
    # `z = k * (remaining_space - ideal_remaining_space)`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))`
    # This score increases as `remaining_space` increases. So it favors larger remaining spaces.
    # We need to cap this and also ensure it's 0 for `remaining_space < 0`.

    # Let's go back to the `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # The goal is to place the item into a bin such that the resulting `bins_remain_cap` is optimal.
    # The optimal state is often considered to be bins that are "nearly full".
    # Let's assign a priority score that represents how close we are to this "nearly full" state.

    # Let's use a Sigmoid to represent the "closeness" to being full.
    # Remaining capacity `c`. Item size `i`.
    # Bin is "fuller" when `c` is smaller (for a fixed item `i`).
    # We want smaller `c` values (but `c >= i`).
    # Let's focus on bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want to prioritize `x` values that are small, but not smaller than `item`.
    # Let `ideal_max_remain_cap = item * 1.2`.
    # We want high scores for `bins_remain_cap` in the range `[item, ideal_max_remain_cap]`.

    # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ideal_max_remain_cap - bins_remain_cap)))` for bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # This function increases as `bins_remain_cap` increases. It peaks at `bins_remain_cap = ideal_max_remain_cap`.
    # This is still favoring larger remaining capacities up to a point.

    # Let's consider the "distance" from the ideal ratio `x0`.
    # We want bins where `ratios` is close to `x0`.
    # Let's re-center the sigmoid: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))`
    # This gives higher values for larger ratios.

    # We want bins that are NOT too full (ratio >= 1).
    # Bins with ratio < 1 should have zero priority.
    # Bins with ratio >= 1, we want to prioritize those closest to `x0`.

    # Let's define a function that is high around `x0` and decreases away.
    # Option 1: Logistic "bump" function: `1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - x0))) * 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))`
    # This is effectively `sech^2(k * (ratios - x0) / 2)`. This is Gaussian-like.

    # Option 2: Two-sided sigmoid approach.
    # If `ratios < x0`, we want priority to increase as `ratios` increases.
    # If `ratios > x0`, we want priority to decrease as `ratios` increases.

    # Let's try mapping the ratio to a value that we can then apply a sigmoid to.
    # We want the "best" fit to be around `item` capacity.
    # Consider the "slack" in the bin: `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want slack to be small but positive.

    # Let's try a sigmoid that models "how suitable" a bin is.
    # For bins with `bins_remain_cap < item`, they are unsuitable. Priority = 0.
    # For bins with `bins_remain_cap >= item`, they are suitable to some degree.
    # Let's focus on `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # We want to give higher scores to bins with `bins_remain_cap` closer to `item`.
    # But also, bins with slightly more capacity than `item` might be better than exact fits.

    # Let's use the original item size `item` as the reference.
    # And `bins_remain_cap` as the actual remaining capacity.
    # We are looking for bins where `bins_remain_cap` is "just enough" but not too much.

    # Let `ideal_cap = item * 1.1` (a bit more than the item itself).
    # And `slack = bins_remain_cap - ideal_cap`.
    # We want to maximize the sigmoid of `-slack`. This means small positive slack is best.

    # To use the sigmoid fitting strategy, we need to map our 'quality' metric
    # to an argument for the sigmoid function.
    # Let's use the ratio `bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to prioritize bins where this ratio is close to 1.0 to 1.2.

    # Let's use a sigmoid function of the form `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (x - x0)))`.
    # If we want higher values for `x` around `x0`, this standard sigmoid is problematic.

    # Let's reframe: A good bin is one that accepts the item AND leaves a "good" amount of space.
    # "Good" space is relative to the item.

    # Consider a scoring function that rewards bins that are not too full and not too empty.
    # Bins that cannot fit the item get a score of 0.
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For bins that can fit the item, let's compute a score based on remaining capacity.

    # Let's define a "target remaining capacity" `target_rc`.
    # A reasonable target is `item * 1.2`.
    target_rc = item * 1.2

    # The difference from the target: `bins_remain_cap[can_fit] - target_rc`
    # We want this difference to be close to 0.
    # Let's map this difference using a sigmoid that peaks at 0.
    # `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-difference)))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(k * difference))`.
    # This function is high when `difference` is negative (i.e., `bins_remain_cap` is less than `target_rc`).
    # And low when `difference` is positive. This is the opposite of what we want.

    # We want a function that is high when `difference` is near 0.
    # So, let's consider `exp(-k * (difference)^2)` which is Gaussian.
    # But we need a sigmoid.

    # Let's go back to the ratio `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Target ratio `x0 = 1.2`.
    # We want values close to `x0` to have high priority.
    # Let's try a sigmoid which increases towards `x0` and then decreases after `x0`.
    # This can be seen as `sigmoid(k * (ratios - x0))` where `k` is negative for the decreasing part.
    # This implies `sigmoid_part1 = 1 / (1 + exp(-k1 * (ratios - x0)))` and
    # `sigmoid_part2 = 1 / (1 + exp(k2 * (ratios - x0)))`.
    # Then combine them: `score = sigmoid_part1 * sigmoid_part2`.
    # For a symmetric peak, k1=k2. Let k1 = k2 = k.
    # `score = (1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))) * (1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - x0))))`
    # `score = 1 / ((1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0))) * (1 + exp(k * (ratios - x0))))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*(ratios-x0)) + exp(k*(ratios-x0)) + 1)`
    # `score = 1 / (2 + 2 * cosh(k * (ratios - x0)))`
    # This is proportional to `sech^2`.

    # Let's simplify. We want bins that are "just right".
    # bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. `item` is the item size.
    # The "fit" can be measured by `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want this difference to be small and positive.

    # Let's define `fit_metric = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Target `x0 = 1.2`.
    # Sigmoid: `S(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))`
    # We want high score for `fit_metric` near `x0`.

    # Let's try to model "fit goodness" with a sigmoid.
    # A bin that's too full has a negative value. A bin that's perfectly full has a zero value.
    # A bin that's just right has a small positive value.
    # A bin that's too empty has a large positive value.

    # Let's consider the "filling ratio" if the item is placed: `(bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap_initial`.
    # This is tricky as initial capacity isn't given directly in this function.

    # Let's use the remaining capacity and item size directly.
    # A bin is "good" if `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Among these, we want those where `bins_remain_cap` is closest to `item`.

    # Sigmoid strategy implies using `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` or its variants.
    # We want to map our "goodness" measure to `x`.
    # Let's define a "desirability" score:
    # Bins that cannot fit the item get score 0.
    # For bins that can fit (`bins_remain_cap >= item`):
    # We want higher scores for `bins_remain_cap` closer to `item`.
    # Let `distance_from_ideal = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want to minimize this distance.
    # Let's map `distance_from_ideal` to `z` for a sigmoid.

    # Let's try to get a score that is high for `bins_remain_cap` slightly greater than `item`.
    # Consider `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`.
    # This score increases with `bins_remain_cap`. This favors larger bins.
    # We need to penalize bins that are too large.

    # Let's use the ratio again: `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Target `x0 = 1.2`.
    # Let's consider the "excess capacity ratio": `excess_ratio = (bins_remain_cap - item) / item`.
    # We want `excess_ratio` to be small and positive.
    # Let `y = excess_ratio`. We want peak at `y` near 0.2 (which corresponds to ratio 1.2).
    # A sigmoid that peaks around a value and decreases symmetrically is difficult with a single sigmoid.

    # Let's try a simple sigmoid interpretation that captures "goodness of fit".
    # The sigmoid function is monotonic. So we can use it to express "how likely is this to be a good fit".
    # A common approach is to map a "quality" to the argument of the sigmoid.

    # Let's consider bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # For these bins, let's define a "fit quality" `f`.
    # We want `f` to be higher when `bins_remain_cap` is closer to `item`.
    # Let's use the ratio `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want higher scores for `ratios` around `1.0` to `1.2`.

    # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - x0)))`.
    # This score increases with `ratios`. So it favors larger remaining capacities.
    # To favor bins that are "just right", we need a score that drops for larger capacities.

    # Consider a "penalty" for being too empty: `penalty_empty = max(0, item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # Consider a "penalty" for being too full (but still fits): `penalty_full = max(0, bins_remain_cap - item * 1.2)`.
    # We want to minimize penalties.

    # Let's use the Sigmoid Fit Score as a measure of "how well does this bin 'fit' the item
    # in a way that's optimal for future packing."
    # The ideal scenario is a bin that is *almost* full, but not quite.
    # Let's consider bins that have remaining capacity `c`.
    # We are placing an item of size `i`.
    # A bin is a potential candidate if `c >= i`.
    # Among these, we want bins where `c` is "just enough" but not excessively large.

    # Let's use the ratio `c / i`.
    # Target ratio `x0 = 1.2` (meaning bin has 20% spare capacity).
    # A standard sigmoid `S(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))` is increasing.
    # If we use `z = k * (c/i - x0)`, then score increases as `c/i` increases.
    # This isn't quite right, as it rewards large remaining capacities.

    # Let's consider the complement of the standard sigmoid for the "decreasing" part.
    # `1 - S(z) = exp(-z) / (1 + exp(-z))`. This is decreasing.
    # If we want a peak, we can combine two sigmoids:
    # `Score = S(k * (c/i - x0)) * (1 - S(k * (c/i - x0)))` -- this is Gaussian-like.

    # Let's consider a simpler interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score".
    # We want to prioritize bins that are not too full and not too empty.
    # Let's define a "tightness score":
    # `tightness = bins_remain_cap / item`
    # We want tightness to be around `1.0` to `1.2`.
    # Let `ideal_tightness = 1.1`.
    # `z = k * (tightness - ideal_tightness)`
    # A score like `1 / (1 + exp(-z))` favors higher tightness.

    # Let's consider the "waste": `waste = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want waste to be small and positive.
    # Let `waste_score = exp(-k * waste)`. This favors smaller waste.
    # This isn't a sigmoid-fit score though.

    # Let's use a Sigmoid to represent "how well does this bin perform IF it fits".
    # A bin that is too full has poor performance.
    # A bin that is very empty also has poor performance (wasted space).
    # The best performance is for bins that are "just right".

    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want a high score for `r` around `1.0` to `1.2`.
    # Let's use `x0 = 1.1` as the center of our preference.
    # Consider `sigmoid_up = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * (r - x0)))`. This increases with `r`.
    # Consider `sigmoid_down = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * (r - x0)))`. This decreases with `r`.
    # A product could give a peak: `score = sigmoid_up * sigmoid_down`.
    # This would be `1 / (2 + exp(k*(r-x0)) + exp(-k*(r-x0)))`.

    # Let's consider bins that are too small first.
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # For bins that can fit, let's calculate their suitability score.
    # Suitability should be higher for bins with remaining capacity closer to `item`,
    # but slightly larger.
    # Let the target remaining capacity be `target = item * 1.2`.
    target_capacity = item * 1.2

    # We want to maximize a score related to `target_capacity - bins_remain_cap`.
    # Specifically, we want a high score when `target_capacity - bins_remain_cap` is near 0.
    # This is essentially `bins_remain_cap - target_capacity`. We want this to be near 0.
    # Let `diff = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - target_capacity`
    # We want a function that is high for `diff` near 0.
    # Let's use `f(diff) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * diff))`. This peaks at 0 and is decreasing.
    # No, this peaks at 0 and is INCREASING. `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`.
    # `f(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))` means `f` increases with `z`. So if `z = k * diff`, `f` increases with `diff`.
    # This means it favors bins that are LARGER than the target.

    # Let's use `z = k * (target_capacity - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])`.
    # Then `f(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))` will be high when `target_capacity - bins_remain_cap` is positive and large.
    # This favors bins that are SMALLER than the target.

    # We need a function that is high when `bins_remain_cap` is NEAR `target_capacity`.
    # A sigmoid centered at the target capacity is needed for the "goodness".

    # Let's try using `sigmoid(k * (bin_capacity - item))` to favor bins that are not too small.
    # And `sigmoid(k * (item * 1.5 - bin_capacity))` to favor bins that are not too large.
    # Let `target_peak = item * 1.1`.
    # We can use the ratio `r = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to score bins where `r` is near `1.0` to `1.2`.

    # Consider a metric: how "close" is `bins_remain_cap` to `item`?
    # `distance = abs(bins_remain_cap - item)`
    # We want to minimize this distance for bins that can fit.

    # Let's use the sigmoid function directly to represent the desirability of remaining capacity.
    # For a bin to be desirable, it should have capacity `c` such that `item <= c <= item * some_factor`.
    # Let the factor be `F = 1.5`. So we prefer `item <= c <= 1.5 * item`.
    # `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`. We prefer `1.0 <= ratios <= 1.5`.

    # Sigmoid form: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * x))`
    # If we want a score that peaks, it means it increases and then decreases.
    # Let `ideal_ratio = 1.1`.
    # Let `k = 5.0` (controls steepness).

    # Consider the "goodness" metric: `goodness = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to give a higher score to values close to `1.1`.
    # Let `z = k * (goodness - 1.1)`.
    # We want the sigmoid function to evaluate to something high when `z` is close to `0`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(-z))` increases as `z` increases.
    # To get a peak, we need a function that increases and then decreases.
    # This can be achieved by multiplying two sigmoids, or using a bell-shaped curve.
    # A common approach to get a peak using sigmoids is:
    # `score = Sigmoid(k1 * (value - center1)) * Sigmoid(-k2 * (value - center2))`
    # For a symmetric peak, center1 = center2 = `ideal_value`, and `k1 = k2 = k`.
    # `score = Sigmoid(k * (value - ideal_value)) * Sigmoid(-k * (value - ideal_value))`
    # `score = [1 / (1 + exp(-k*(value - ideal_value)))] * [1 / (1 + exp(k*(value - ideal_value)))]`

    # Let's apply this:
    # `value = bins_remain_cap / item`
    # `ideal_value = 1.1` (meaning we prefer bins with 10% more capacity than the item)
    # `k = 5.0` (controls how sharp the peak is)

    # First, handle cases where `item` is zero or negative (although problem implies positive sizes).
    if item <= 1e-9:
        # If item size is negligible, all bins are equally suitable.
        # Prioritize bins with less remaining capacity to encourage packing tighter.
        # A simple approach is to return the inverse of remaining capacity, normalized.
        # Or just return a flat score, as any bin will do.
        # For consistency with the sigmoid idea, let's give a high score to less filled bins.
        # Let's return a score based on how much capacity is LEFT, inversely.
        # The flatter the capacity, the better it is for future items.
        # So, a higher score for bins with LESS remaining capacity.
        # We want a high score for smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
        # Let's use sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-bins_remain_cap)))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`.
        # This decreases with `bins_remain_cap`. So we need the inverse: `1 - 1 / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`
        # which is `exp(k * bins_remain_cap) / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`. This increases with capacity.
        # We want to prioritize LESS capacity.
        # Let's use sigmoid on inverse capacity: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-bins_remain_cap)))` where `k` is positive.
        # So, `1 / (1 + exp(k * bins_remain_cap))`.
        # To prioritize LESS remaining capacity, we want this score to be HIGH for small bins_remain_cap.
        # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * x))` decreases with x. So this works.
        # However, we are trying to PACK an item. If item is 0, it doesn't need packing.
        # Let's return zeros, or perhaps a preference for the most empty bins to leave room for larger items.
        # For the problem statement (packing an item), a zero item doesn't need placing.
        # However, if we interpret it as "if there's a zero item, which bin is most 'optimal' to put it in",
        # it might be the least filled bin.
        # Let's return a score that is higher for bins with less remaining capacity.
        # `priorities = 1.0 - bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)` is simple, but not sigmoid.
        # `priorities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(5 * bins_remain_cap))`. This decreases as capacity increases.
        # Let's just return a constant high value, indicating all are equally good for a null item.
        return np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap) * 0.5 # Mid-range preference, not too full, not too empty.

    ratios = bins_remain_cap / item
    ideal_ratio = 1.1  # Target: bin capacity should be 1.1 times the item size.
    k = 5.0          # Steepness parameter for the sigmoid.

    # Calculate the first sigmoid component: favors ratios less than or equal to ideal_ratio.
    # `sigmoid_up = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))`
    # This score is high when `ratios - ideal_ratio` is positive, i.e., ratios > ideal_ratio.
    # We want high score when `ratios` is NOT too large.
    # So, let's use `1 - sigmoid(k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))`
    # which is `exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)) / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))`.
    # This is `sigmoid(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))`.
    sigmoid_part1 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))) # High for ratios > ideal_ratio

    # Calculate the second sigmoid component: favors ratios greater than or equal to ideal_ratio.
    # We want high score when `ratios` is NOT too small (i.e., >= item).
    # `sigmoid_down = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))`
    # This score is high when `ratios - ideal_ratio` is negative, i.e., ratios < ideal_ratio.
    # We want to prioritize bins that can fit the item (`ratios >= 1`).
    # So, let's use this to favor ratios closer to ideal_ratio from below.
    sigmoid_part2 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * (ratios - ideal_ratio))) # High for ratios < ideal_ratio

    # Combine the two: the product will be high only when both sigmoids are moderately high.
    # This creates a peak around `ideal_ratio`.
    priorities = sigmoid_part1 * sigmoid_part2

    # Ensure that bins that cannot fit the item (bins_remain_cap < item) get zero priority.
    # This means `ratios < 1`.
    # For `ratios < 1`, `ratios - ideal_ratio` is negative and large.
    # `sigmoid_part1` will be close to 0. `sigmoid_part2` will be close to 1.
    # The product `priorities` will be close to 0. This is good.

    # Let's refine the "ideal_ratio". It should ideally be related to `item` size.
    # A larger `k` makes the peak narrower and higher.
    # The product `sigmoid_part1 * sigmoid_part2` creates a bell-like shape.
    # `sigmoid_part1` increases with `ratios`. `sigmoid_part2` decreases with `ratios`.
    # The peak is at `ratios = ideal_ratio`.

    # Let's reconsider the core idea: Sigmoid Fit Score.
    # This should capture how well the item *fits*.
    # A tight fit is good, but not if it leaves no room.
    # An excess of room is also not ideal (wasted space).
    # The "perfect" fit leaves minimal, but positive, remaining space.

    # Let's use a single sigmoid to represent the "quality of space left".
    # `remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want this to be positive and small.
    # Let `ideal_remaining_space = item * 0.1` (10% of item size).
    # `z = k * (remaining_space - ideal_remaining_space)`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-z))`
    # This score increases as `remaining_space` increases. So it favors larger remaining spaces.
    # We need to cap this and also ensure it's 0 for `remaining_space < 0`.

    # Let's go back to the `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # The goal is to place the item into a bin such that the resulting `bins_remain_cap` is optimal.
    # The optimal state is often considered to be bins that are "nearly full".
    # Let's assign a priority score that represents how close we are to this "nearly full" state.

    # Let's use a Sigmoid to represent the "closeness" to being full.
    # Remaining capacity `c`. Item size `i`.
    # Bin is "fuller" when `c` is smaller (for a fixed item `i`).
    # We want smaller `c` values (but `c >= i`).
    # Let's focus on bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want to prioritize `x` values that are small, but not smaller than `item`.
    # Let `ideal_max_remain_cap = item * 1.2`.
    # We want high scores for `bins_remain_cap` in the range `[item, ideal_max_remain_cap]`.

    # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ideal_max_remain_cap - bins_remain_cap)))` for bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # This function increases as `bins_remain_cap` increases. It peaks at `bins_remain_cap = ideal_max_remain_cap`.
    # This is still favoring larger remaining capacities up to a point.

    # The Sigmoid Fit Score implies that the *fit itself* should be evaluated using a sigmoid.
    # Let's try again with `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # `ideal_ratio = 1.1`.
    # We want a function that is high for ratios near `1.1`.
    # `sigmoid_peak = lambda val: 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * (val - x0)))`
    # A symmetric peak can be achieved with `sigmoid_peak(val) * sigmoid_peak(-val)`
    # Or `sigmoid_peak(val) * (1 - sigmoid_peak(val))` (Gaussian-like).

    # Let's simplify the interpretation: We want bins that are not overly full, and not overly empty.
    # `score = sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` penalizes bins where `bins_remain_cap < item`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`.
    # This score is low if `bins_remain_cap` is much less than `item`. It increases as `bins_remain_cap` increases.
    # This already gives a preference to bins that can fit.
    # To refine it, we want to favor bins that aren't excessively large.

    # Let's use `k1` for the initial increase and `k2` for the subsequent decrease.
    # `part1 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k1 * (bins_remain_cap - item)))` (favors fitting)
    # `part2 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k2 * (item * target_factor - bins_remain_cap)))` (favors not too large)
    # `target_factor = 1.2`
    # `priorities = part1 * part2`

    # Ensure `item` is positive for division.
    if item < 1e-9:
        # If item is zero, all bins are equally "good" or irrelevant.
        # Returning a uniform score (e.g., 0.5) is reasonable.
        return np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap) * 0.5

    # Calculate suitability for bins that can fit the item.
    # `ratios = bins_remain_cap / item`
    # We want to prioritize ratios that are close to a 'sweet spot'.
    # The sweet spot is slightly larger than 1, allowing some remaining capacity.
    # Let the ideal remaining capacity be `item * 1.2`.
    # So the ideal ratio is `1.2`.

    # Using two sigmoids to create a peak.
    # `k_steepness` controls how sharp the peak is.
    k_steepness = 6.0
    ideal_ratio = 1.1  # Prefer bins that leave around 10% of item size as remaining capacity.

    # Sigmoid 1: Score increases as `bins_remain_cap / item` increases.
    # This favors bins that are not too full.
    # `score1 = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratio - x0)))`
    # Let `x0 = ideal_ratio`. So `score1` is high for `ratio > ideal_ratio`.
    # We want to favor bins that are not excessively full, and not excessively empty.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(k * (ratio - ideal_ratio))`. This is high for `ratio > ideal_ratio`.
    score_part1 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k_steepness * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))

    # Sigmoid 2: Score decreases as `bins_remain_cap / item` increases.
    # This favors bins that are not too empty.
    # We want score to be high for `ratio < ideal_ratio`.
    # Use `sigmoid(-k * (ratio - ideal_ratio))`. This is high for `ratio < ideal_ratio`.
    score_part2 = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k_steepness * (ratios - ideal_ratio)))

    # The product gives a peak around `ideal_ratio`.
    priorities = score_part1 * score_part2

    # Ensure bins too small to fit the item have zero priority.
    # For `ratios < 1`, `ratios - ideal_ratio` is negative.
    # `score_part1` will be close to 0, `score_part2` will be close to 1. Product is close to 0. Correct.

    # What if `bins_remain_cap` is very large?
    # `ratios` is very large. `score_part1` is near 1. `score_part2` is near 0. Product is near 0. Correct.

    # This approach effectively creates a Gaussian-like peak, using sigmoids.
    # This is a common way to interpret "Sigmoid Fit Score" for optimization where
    # a middle ground is preferred.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize simplicity and directness for heuristics. Focus on minimizing wasted space ("tight fit," "almost full") as a primary goal. Complex, multi-component heuristics require careful tuning and may not always outperform simpler, well-defined strategies. Ensure zero-priority cases are handled correctly.

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

    # For bins where it fits, calculate a combined score
    # High priority for small remaining capacity after fitting (tight fit)
    # High priority for large remaining capacity overall (future flexibility)
    
    # A simple approach could be:
    # Priority for fitting bins: A high score if remaining_cap - item is small and positive
    # A low score if remaining_cap - item is large and positive.
    
    # Let's use a logistic function where the input represents a combination
    # of how much space is left after placing the item and the total remaining space.
    
    # Option 1: Favor tight fits, but don't entirely ignore bins with more space.
    # Map (bins_remain_cap - item) to a "goodness of fit" score.
    # Small positive difference = good.
    # Large positive difference = okay.
    # Negative difference = bad.
    
    # We can use a sigmoid on the inverse of the remaining capacity after placement.
    # If remaining_cap - item is small, then 1 / (remaining_cap - item) is large.
    # If remaining_cap - item is large, then 1 / (remaining_cap - item) is small.
    
    # To handle the case where item does not fit, we set priority to 0.
    # For bins that fit, we want to prioritize those with `bins_remain_cap - item` closer to 0.

    # bins with too much empty space.
    
    # Let's define a preference for bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is minimized.
    # We can use the sigmoid function on a term that decreases as (bins_remain_cap - item) increases.
    
    # Consider the "waste" if we place the item: bins_remain_cap - item.
    # We want to minimize this waste for a perfect fit, but we also want
    # bins with larger `bins_remain_cap` to be considered if the waste isn't too large.
    
    # A score that prioritizes bins where (bins_remain_cap - item) is small and positive.
    # Let's try sigmoid(- (bins_remain_cap - item) * 0.5 + bins_remain_cap * 0.05)
    
    # This formula will give higher values for:
    # 1. Bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive (due to the negative sign on this term)
    # 2. Bins where `bins_remain_cap` is large (due to the positive sign on this term)
    
    # Let's refine: We want a higher score if `bins_remain_cap` is large enough to fit the item,
    # and within those, we prefer those that result in less remaining capacity after fitting.
    # This means `bins_remain_cap - item` should be as small as possible, but non-negative.
    
    # Let's use the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item as input to sigmoid.
    # This favors bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small (i.e., a tight fit).
    # We also want to consider the overall remaining capacity to some extent.
    
    # Option: Sigmoid of a function that decreases with (bins_remain_cap - item)
    # and increases with bins_remain_cap.
    
    # Let's combine two aspects:
    # 1. How well the item fits (smaller remainder is better).
    # 2. How much total capacity is left (larger might be good for future items).
    
    # Consider the term `bins_remain_cap - item`. We want this to be close to zero, but positive.
    # Let's use `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item))` which gives higher values for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Then, apply sigmoid to scale these values and the overall remaining capacity.
    
    # Final idea: Prioritize bins where the item fits, and among those,
    # prefer bins that have less remaining space *after* placing the item.
    # This encourages filling bins efficiently.
    
    # We want `bins_remain_cap - item` to be small and non-negative.
    # `sigmoid( -(bins_remain_cap - item) )` would do this.
    # However, we also want to prefer bins that generally have more capacity
    # for future items, but not excessively so that it leads to too many half-empty bins.
    
    # Let's try this: Sigmoid on the term that captures "snugness".
    # A bin is a good candidate if `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Among fitting bins, a higher score for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    
    # Use a scaling factor to control the steepness of the sigmoid curve.
    # `scale = 1.0` makes the transition around 0.
    # We want to map `bins_remain_cap - item` such that values near 0
    # result in high priority.
    
    # Let's use `np.exp(-bins_remain_cap / C)`. Higher `bins_remain_cap` -> lower score.
    # This is for the "fill them up" strategy.
    
    # For the "first fit decreasing" or "best fit" idea, we want a tight fit.
    # `sigmoid(-(bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small (tight fit), the argument is close to 0, sigmoid is ~0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large negative (item too big), argument is large positive, sigmoid is ~1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive (loose fit), argument is large negative, sigmoid is ~0.
    
    # This is the inverse of what we want. We want higher priority for tight fits.
    
    # Try: `sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive (tight fit), sigmoid argument is small positive, ~0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive (loose fit), sigmoid argument is large positive, ~1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative (won't fit), sigmoid argument is negative, ~0.
    
    # This seems to align better with favoring bins with less remaining capacity after placement.
    # The `k` parameter controls how sensitive we are to the "tightness".
    # `k=1.0` gives sigmoid(0) = 0.5 for a perfect fit.
    
    # Let's add a slight preference for bins that have *some* space left,
    # to avoid immediately creating many bins with no room left.
    # Maybe `sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item) + c * bins_remain_cap)`
    
    # Let's consider the goal: fill bins optimally.
    # A good bin is one that can accommodate the item and leaves minimal remaining space.
    # `remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item`
    # We want `remaining_after_fit` to be small and non-negative.
    
    # Consider a function `f(x)` where `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want `f(x)` to be high when `x` is small and non-negative.
    # `f(x) = exp(-x / scale)` for `x >= 0`, and `0` otherwise.
    # Then scale this with sigmoid.
    
    # Calculate how much space would be left if we put the item in.
    space_left = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Create a "fit score" that is high for small, non-negative `space_left`.
    # We'll use the negative of `space_left` to map "small positive" to "large positive"
    # for the sigmoid input.
    # If `space_left` is negative (item doesn't fit), we want a very low priority.
    # So, we can use a very large negative number for sigmoid input.
    
    fit_input = np.where(space_left >= 0, -space_left, -1e9) # Penalize items that don't fit
    
    # We can also incorporate a term related to the absolute remaining capacity.
    # Perhaps bins that are already quite full (but can still fit the item) are prioritized.
    # Let's consider the *normalized* remaining capacity as a secondary factor.
    # However, this can be tricky without knowing the overall bin capacity limit.
    # Assuming a standard bin capacity (e.g., 100):
    
    # Let's stick to the primary goal: tight fits.
    # The input to sigmoid: `k * (-space_left)`
    # `k` controls the sensitivity to tightness.
    # `k = 1.0` -> `sigmoid(-space_left)`
    # If `space_left` is 0 (perfect fit), sigmoid(0) = 0.5
    # If `space_left` is 1 (loose fit), sigmoid(-1) = ~0.27
    # If `space_left` is 5 (very loose), sigmoid(-5) = ~0.0067
    # If `space_left` is -1 (item too big), fit_input is -1e9, sigmoid(-1e9) = ~0.
    
    # This seems to prioritize bins with smaller positive remaining space.
    # Let's call this `best_fit_score`.
    
    # What if we also want to slightly favor bins that have a lot of capacity,
    # but only if they *also* provide a relatively good fit?
    # This is where it gets tricky to combine with sigmoid elegantly.
    
    # For a pure "Best Fit" heuristic, `sigmoid(- (bins_remain_cap - item))` is good.
    # We can adjust the steepness with a multiplier.
    
    # Let's go with a strong bias towards best fit, modulated by the possibility of filling a bin.
    # The score should be higher if `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive.
    
    # Consider a function `f(x)` where `x = bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want to give a higher score if `x` is moderately large, but also
    # if `x - item` is small.
    
    # Let's simplify: Prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap` is just enough to fit the item.
    # The value `bins_remain_cap - item` should be small and positive.
    # `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item))` for items that fit.
    
    # Transform `bins_remain_cap - item` into a score:
    # Items that fit: prioritize small, positive `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Items that don't fit: zero priority.
    
    # Let's create a term that peaks when `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive.
    # Gaussian-like function centered around 0?
    # `np.exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item)**2 / sigma**2)`
    # This would favor fits near 0, but also loose fits equally to tight fits if `bins_remain_cap` is the same.
    
    # Best fit strategy is essentially minimizing `bins_remain_cap - item` for `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # We can use sigmoid for this.
    # `sigmoid( -(bins_remain_cap - item) * sensitivity)`
    # Sensitivity controls how sharply we drop off for looser fits.
    
    sensitivity = 2.0 # Higher sensitivity for tighter fits
    
    # Calculate the argument for the sigmoid function.
    # For bins where the item fits (bins_remain_cap >= item), the argument is
    # `-(bins_remain_cap - item) * sensitivity`.
    # This means a tight fit (small positive `bins_remain_cap - item`) gives an argument close to 0,
    # resulting in a sigmoid score close to 0.5.
    # A loose fit (large positive `bins_remain_cap - item`) gives a large negative argument,
    # resulting in a score close to 0.
    # An item that doesn't fit (`bins_remain_cap < item`) means `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative.
    # So, `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` is positive. This gives a score close to 1.
    # This is the opposite of what we want: items that don't fit should have zero priority.
    
    # Let's correct the logic: we want higher priority for bins where the item FITS and leaves less space.
    # Input to sigmoid should be *higher* for better bins.
    
    # Let `y = bins_remain_cap`. We want to maximize a function that is high when `y >= item`
    # and `y - item` is small.
    
    # Consider `score = sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # if `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
    #   If `bins_remain_cap - item = 0` (perfect fit), score = sigmoid(0) = 0.5
    #   If `bins_remain_cap - item = 10` (loose fit), score = sigmoid(10k)
    # if `bins_remain_cap < item`:
    #   score = sigmoid(<negative value>) -> close to 0.
    
    # This means loose fits get higher scores than perfect fits if `k` is negative.
    # If `k` is positive, perfect fits get higher scores.
    
    # Let's try `k = -1.0` (Best Fit - minimizes remaining capacity).
    # `priorities = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-sensitivity * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # For `bins_remain_cap - item = 0`: `sigmoid(0)` = 0.5
    # For `bins_remain_cap - item = 10`: `sigmoid(-10)` ~ 0.000045
    # For `bins_remain_cap - item = -1`: `sigmoid(1)` ~ 0.73
    # This still prioritizes items that don't fit.
    
    # The simplest way to handle "does not fit" is to zero out their score.
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    fits = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For bins where the item fits, we want to prioritize those with minimal `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # The function `sigmoid(C * (bins_remain_cap - item))` does the following:
    # - If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative (item too big), input is negative, sigmoid ~0.
    # - If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive (tight fit), input is small positive, sigmoid ~0.5.
    # - If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive (loose fit), input is large positive, sigmoid ~1.
    
    # This seems to be prioritizing loose fits if C > 0.
    # If C < 0, it prioritizes tight fits.
    
    # Let's use C < 0 for best fit.
    # C = -1.0
    # The argument will be `- (bins_remain_cap - item)`.
    # This is equivalent to `(item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # We want to prioritize small values of `item - bins_remain_cap` (i.e., `bins_remain_cap - item` close to 0).
    
    # Consider the score `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`.
    # `k` is sensitivity. Higher `k` means more pronounced difference.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is small positive (tight fit), `sigmoid` is ~0.5.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is large positive (loose fit), `sigmoid` is ~1.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is negative (item too big), `sigmoid` is ~0.
    
    # This is again prioritizing loose fits.
    
    # Okay, let's try a different approach to map `bins_remain_cap - item` to a priority score.
    # We want to map [0, large_positive] to [high_priority, low_priority].
    # A simple mapping is `1 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap - item) / scale)`.
    # This is similar to sigmoid's shape.
    
    # Let's use sigmoid on `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` which is `item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap = 0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0)` = 0.5
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap = 10` (loose fit): `sigmoid(10k)`
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap = -10` (item too big): `sigmoid(-10k)`
    
    # Let `k = 1.0`.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is small positive (tight fit), sigmoid(small_pos) ~ 0.5
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is large positive (loose fit), sigmoid(large_pos) ~ 1.
    # If `item - bins_remain_cap` is negative (item too big), sigmoid(negative) ~ 0.
    
    # This appears to prioritize loose fits over tight fits.
    
    # Let's redefine our objective:
    # We are designing a priority function for the *selection* of a bin.
    # Higher priority means it's *more likely* to be chosen.
    
    # We want to favor bins that are "good".
    # A good bin is one that can fit the item and has minimal space left over.
    # The value `bins_remain_cap - item` should be minimized, subject to `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    
    # We can use `sigmoid` to map the "badness" (`bins_remain_cap - item`) to a score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is 0, we want a high score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive, we want a low score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative, we want a score of 0.
    
    # Consider `sigmoid(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` where `k > 0`.
    # `k=1`:
    # `bins_remain_cap - item = 0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0)` = 0.5
    # `bins_remain_cap - item = 10` (loose fit): `sigmoid(-10)` ~ 0.000045
    # `bins_remain_cap - item = -1` (too big): `sigmoid(1)` ~ 0.73
    
    # Still a problem with items that don't fit.
    # Let's enforce the "fits" condition first by zeroing out scores.
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For bins that fit, calculate a "fit quality" score.
    # Higher score for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    
    # Let's use `sigmoid(C * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
    # This maps `item - bins_remain_cap` to a [0, 1] range.
    # `item - bins_remain_cap` = `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`
    
    # We want `bins_remain_cap - item` to be small and positive.
    # This means `item - bins_remain_cap` should be small and negative.
    
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want to map `[0, large_pos]` to `[high_score, low_score]`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + x / scale)` or `sigmoid(log(x / scale))` could work.
    
    # Let's use the direct property of sigmoid: `sigmoid(z)` increases from 0 to 1 as `z` increases.
    # We want a higher score for smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # This means we want the argument to sigmoid to be smaller as `bins_remain_cap - item` increases.
    # So, the argument should be proportional to `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
    
    # Let `argument = -sensitivity * (bins_remain_cap - item)`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is 0 (perfect fit), argument is 0, sigmoid(0) = 0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is 10 (loose fit), argument is -10*sensitivity.
    # If `sensitivity = 1`, sigmoid(-10) is very small.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is -1 (too big), argument is 1*sensitivity.
    # If `sensitivity = 1`, sigmoid(1) is ~0.73.
    
    # So, with `sigmoid(-sensitivity * (bins_remain_cap - item))`:
    # - For items that fit, scores decrease as the fit gets looser. Good.
    # - For items that don't fit, scores are high. Bad.

    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing Heuristic 1 (inverse distances) with Heuristic 2 (sigmoid with weighted sum), Heuristic 1 is simpler and directly targets bins that provide a tight fit by using the inverse ratio of capacities. Heuristic 2 attempts to balance tightness and overall capacity using a sigmoid, but its complexity might not translate to better performance without careful tuning of weights and scaling factors.

Comparing Heuristic 3-8 ("Almost Full Fit" using `1.0 / (remaining_caps_after_fit + epsilon)`) with Heuristic 9 (Best Fit using `-remaining_capacity`), Heuristics 3-8 directly implement the "Almost Full Fit" by prioritizing bins that leave minimal space after placement. Heuristic 9 is a cleaner Best Fit implementation by directly minimizing the negative remaining capacity. The repeated "Almost Full Fit" heuristics (3-8) suggest a strong focus on minimizing residual space, which is a core aspect of efficient bin packing.

Comparing Heuristic 10 (multiplicative combination for "Almost Full Fit") with Heuristic 3-8, Heuristic 10 attempts to combine tight fit (`1/fits`) with initial bin fullness (`item/bins_remain_cap`), which might offer a more nuanced "Almost Full" strategy. However, the simpler inverse of `fits` (as in 3-8) is a more direct interpretation of minimizing residual space.

Comparing Heuristic 19 and 20 (Sigmoid Fit Score with peak around ideal ratio) with others, these heuristics try to find a balance between not too full and not too empty bins using a sigmoid function to model preference. They are more complex than direct "tightest fit" heuristics but aim to optimize for a specific packing characteristic. Heuristic 19/20's approach of creating a peak around an ideal ratio is a sophisticated way to model "good fit" using sigmoids.

Heuristics 14-18 (all zeros) are clearly the worst as they provide no discriminatory priority. Heuristics 11-13 (Epsilon-Greedy) add an exploration component to a Best Fit strategy, which is more applicable in learning scenarios than for deterministic heuristic design.

Overall: Heuristics that directly target minimizing residual space (like "Almost Full Fit" or "Best Fit") appear to be generally strong. Complexity increases with sigmoid-based approaches, which might offer benefits if tuned correctly but can also introduce fragility. Simple, direct mappings often perform well.
- 
Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Goal-oriented, iterative, context-aware, measurable impact.
*   **Advice:** Focus on achieving the heuristic's core objective, not just superficial characteristics. Measure performance against defined goals, not just against "tight fit."
*   **Avoid:** Over-emphasis on simplicity at the expense of effectiveness. Assuming "tight fit" automatically equates to good performance.
*   **Explanation:** True effectiveness comes from solving the problem. Continuously test and refine based on actual outcomes, adapting the heuristic to the specific problem context.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    available_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    available_bins_cap = bins_remain_cap[available_bins_mask]
    
    if available_bins_cap.size == 0:
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    inverse_distances = available_bins_cap / (available_bins_cap - item + 1e-9)
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities[available_bins_mask] = inverse_distances
    
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Goal-oriented, iterative, context-aware, measurable impact.
*   **Advice:** Focus on achieving the heuristic's core objective, not just superficial characteristics. Measure performance against defined goals, not just against "tight fit."
*   **Avoid:** Over-emphasis on simplicity at the expense of effectiveness. Assuming "tight fit" automatically equates to good performance.
*   **Explanation:** True effectiveness comes from solving the problem. Continuously test and refine based on actual outcomes, adapting the heuristic to the specific problem context.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    available_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    available_bins_cap = bins_remain_cap[available_bins_mask]
    
    if available_bins_cap.size == 0:
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    inverse_distances = available_bins_cap / (available_bins_cap - item + 1e-9)
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities[available_bins_mask] = inverse_distances
    
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
