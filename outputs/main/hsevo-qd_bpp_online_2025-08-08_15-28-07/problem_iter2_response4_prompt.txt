Heuristic 2 attempts to balance tightness and overall capacity using a sigmoid, but its complexity might not translate to better performance without careful tuning of weights and scaling factors.\n\nComparing Heuristic 3-8 (\"Almost Full Fit\" using `1.0 / (remaining_caps_after_fit + epsilon)`) with Heuristic 9 (Best Fit using `-remaining_capacity`), Heuristics 3-8 directly implement the \"Almost Full Fit\" by prioritizing bins that leave minimal space after placement. Heuristic 9 is a cleaner Best Fit implementation by directly minimizing the negative remaining capacity. The repeated \"Almost Full Fit\" heuristics (3-8) suggest a strong focus on minimizing residual space, which is a core aspect of efficient bin packing.\n\nComparing Heuristic 10 (multiplicative combination for \"Almost Full Fit\") with Heuristic 3-8, Heuristic 10 attempts to combine tight fit (`1/fits`) with initial bin fullness (`item/bins_remain_cap`), which might offer a more nuanced \"Almost Full\" strategy. However, the simpler inverse of `fits` (as in 3-8) is a more direct interpretation of minimizing residual space.\n\nComparing Heuristic 19 and 20 (Sigmoid Fit Score with peak around ideal ratio) with others, these heuristics try to find a balance between not too full and not too empty bins using a sigmoid function to model preference. They are more complex than direct \"tightest fit\" heuristics but aim to optimize for a specific packing characteristic. Heuristic 19/20's approach of creating a peak around an ideal ratio is a sophisticated way to model \"good fit\" using sigmoids.\n\nHeuristics 14-18 (all zeros) are clearly the worst as they provide no discriminatory priority. Heuristics 11-13 (Epsilon-Greedy) add an exploration component to a Best Fit strategy, which is more applicable in learning scenarios than for deterministic heuristic design.\n\nOverall: Heuristics that directly target minimizing residual space (like \"Almost Full Fit\" or \"Best Fit\") appear to be generally strong. Complexity increases with sigmoid-based approaches, which might offer benefits if tuned correctly but can also introduce fragility. Simple, direct mappings often perform well.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Goal-oriented, iterative, context-aware, measurable impact.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on achieving the heuristic's core objective, not just superficial characteristics. Measure performance against defined goals, not just against \"tight fit.\"\n*   **Avoid:** Over-emphasis on simplicity at the expense of effectiveness. Assuming \"tight fit\" automatically equates to good performance.\n*   **Explanation:** True effectiveness comes from solving the problem. Continuously test and refine based on actual outcomes, adapting the heuristic to the specific problem context.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
