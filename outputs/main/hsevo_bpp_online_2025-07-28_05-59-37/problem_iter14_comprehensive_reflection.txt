**Keywords**: Adaptive normalization, hybrid metrics, entropy control, reinforcement-inspired gains  
**Advice**: Prioritize adaptive normalization to balance metric scales. Design hybrid metrics blending fit/utilization with nonlinear boosts. Use system entropy to adjust penalty weights. Prefer reinforcement-inspired tie-breakers (e.g., entropy gradients) over random perturbations.  
**Avoid**: Static thresholds, entropy penalties without context, vague dynamic weight algorithms, perturbation mechanisms as primary tie-breakers.  
**Explanation**: Avoiding buzzword-heavy constructs (e.g., "Z-score synergy") clarifies implementation. Directly linking entropy control to adaptive weights improves stability, while reinforcement-inspired gains ensure exploitable heuristics. Overcomplicated metrics dilute practicalityâ€”prioritize validated, context-aware logic for scalability.
