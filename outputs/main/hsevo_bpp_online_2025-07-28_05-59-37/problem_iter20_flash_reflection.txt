**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive Z-score normalization and dynamic item classification in 1st enhance fit tightness and future flexibility, while 20th's static weights limit adaptability. (2nd) vs (19th) shows entropy-agnostic reinforcement and proximity penalties in 2nd improve balance, whereas 19th's rigid hybrid priority lacks system-wide variance reduction. (3rd) vs (18th) highlights predictive reinforcement and capacity clustering in 3rd outperform 18th's simplistic variance modeling. (5th) vs (16th) demonstrates fragmentation penalties and synergy scores in 5th reduce entropy better than 16th's basic hybrid approach. Overall, top heuristics integrate adaptive normalization, item-size-aware weights, predictive variance control, and entropy-driven balance, while lower ones rely on static metrics and incomplete system modeling.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize adaptive normalization (Z-score, min-max), dynamic weights for item size/system state, predictive variance reduction, entropy-aware balance, and reinforcement learning concepts. Avoid static weights and oversimplified metrics.
