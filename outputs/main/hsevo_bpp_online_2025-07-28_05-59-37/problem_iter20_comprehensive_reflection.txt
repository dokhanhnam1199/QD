• **Keywords**: adaptive normalization, dynamic weights, entropy-aware metrics, reinforcement learning  
• **Advice**: Prioritize Z-score/min-max normalization without variance-ratio synergy, dynamic weights adjusted by real-time state/utilization gradients, entropy-aware balance via layered tie-breakers (e.g., fragility, load), and reinforcement-inspired gains avoiding predictive penalties.  
• **Avoid**: Exponential boosting, perturbation-based tie-breaking, entropy penalties modulated by global metrics, Z-score synergy with variance ratios.  
• **Explanation**: Enhances robustness by focusing on validated dynamic adaptation (not unstable perturbations/exponential boosts) and multi-objective synergy, ensuring heuristic stability and scalability without overfitting to transient system states.
