**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (18th), we see the top heuristic integrates **Z-normalized multiscale synergy** (tight-fit/utilization) with entropy-driven fragmentation control vs basic BF/WF blending. The 1st uses adaptive frag weight (sys_entropy), while 18th uses fixed exponential penalty.  
(4th) vs (19th): 4th implements **cross-metric variance adaptation** (synergy = z_tight * (1 + z_util)) and adaptive frag weights, whereas 19th uses simpler median alignment without dynamic entropy scaling.  
(11th) vs (20th): Both lack unique features of top heuristics like perturbed thresholds and gradient-boosted enhancer. 11th's entropy-regularized tiebreakers are less nuanced than top-ranked heuristics.  
Comparing (1st) vs (4th): The former uses layered priortization with perturbed thresholds and exponential utilization enhancer, while the latter emphasizes entropy-adjusted frag penalty. Top heuristics excel in **hierarchical reinforcement** and **dynamic hybrid weighting**.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize **Z-score synergy** (combining fit/utilization with adaptive weights based on variance ratios). Use **entropy-sensitive penalties** (fragility, balance) modulated by system-level metrics. Integrate **perturbation mechanisms** for tie-breaking and **dynamic enhancers** (e.g., exponential utilization boosting). Document design rationale rigorously for iterative refinement.
