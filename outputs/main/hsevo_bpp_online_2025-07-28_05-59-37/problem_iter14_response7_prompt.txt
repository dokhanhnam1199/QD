Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(second best) vs (second worst) reveals superior fragmentation control through multi-metric variance analysis. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical (possible duplication). (3rd) vs (4th) shows more sophisticated entropy scaling in higher-ranked functions. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both lack dynamic weight optimization found in top heuristics. Overall: superior heuristics balance adaptive normalization, context-aware penalties, and multi-layered sensitivity to system entropy.\n- \n**Keywords**: Adaptive normalization, hybrid metrics, entropy control, reinforcement-inspired gains  \n**Advice**: Prioritize adaptive normalization to balance metric scales. Design hybrid metrics blending fit/utilization with nonlinear boosts. Use system entropy to adjust penalty weights. Prefer reinforcement-inspired tie-breakers (e.g., entropy gradients) over random perturbations.  \n**Avoid**: Static thresholds, entropy penalties without context, vague dynamic weight algorithms, perturbation mechanisms as primary tie-breakers.  \n**Explanation**: Avoiding buzzword-heavy constructs (e.g., \"Z-score synergy\") clarifies implementation. Directly linking entropy control to adaptive weights improves stability, while reinforcement-inspired gains ensure exploitable heuristics. Overcomplicated metrics dilute practicality\u2014prioritize validated, context-aware logic for scalability.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
