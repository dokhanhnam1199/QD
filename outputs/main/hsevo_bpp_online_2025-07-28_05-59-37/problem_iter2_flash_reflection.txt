**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th): The top heuristic combines inverse leftover space and utilization ratio, creating a more nuanced priority than simple hybrid strategies based on mean thresholds. Second-best (3rd) uses exponential decay to heavily penalize non-perfect fits, outperforming the 4th/6th/7th which only use linear leftover space metrics. The 5th improves over the 4th via tie-breaking by utilization (epsilon weighting), while the 12thâ€™s ratio-based approach lacks explicit waste minimization. Hybrid heuristics like the 13th/19th (strategy switches based on item size) perform worse due to simplistic or static thresholds compared to adaptive combinations. Bottom-ranked functions often lack multi-factor integration or overcomplicate logic without validation.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize hybrid metrics (leftover space + utilization) with weighted sensitivity (e.g., exponential decay). Use tie-breaking via small epsilon adjustments. Avoid static thresholds; adapt strategies contextually but keep logic validated.
