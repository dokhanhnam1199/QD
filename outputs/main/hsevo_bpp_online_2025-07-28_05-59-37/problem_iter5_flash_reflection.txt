**Analysis:**  
Comparing 1st vs 20th: Best uses multiple adaptive metrics (inv_waste + utilization + exp_waste) vs Worst applies static Best Fit/Worst Fit switching. 2nd vs 19th: Both blend metrics, but 2nd's exponential penalty prevents fragmentation vs 19th's rigid threshold. 3rd vs 18th: Utilization-weighted fit quality outperforms size-based switching by balancing utilization dynamics. 4th vs 17th: Dynamic epsilon adjustment (item size vs average) improves flexibility vs static linear blending. 5th vs 16th: Global state tracking with entropy-aware tie-breaking adapts better than fixed 50% tightness threshold.  

Top heuristics excel through multi-metric synergy (tight fit + system-wide balance + utilization), real-time normalization (dynamic weights via variance/mean), and layered tie-breaking (fragility, entropies). Struggling heuristics oversimplify with rigid thresholds (fixed average/item-based cuts) or suffer from overcomplexity (stateful systems requiring fine-tuned decay windows). Key losers rely on single heuristic hybrids (Best/Worst Fit mixing) without contextual adaptation.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize multi-objective metrics (tight fit + utilization + system entropy), normalize adaptively to current state, use layered tie-breakers (fragility, load balance), and avoid overly simplistic thresholds. Dynamic weight adjustments using variance, item size ratios, or utilization gradients outperform static rules.
