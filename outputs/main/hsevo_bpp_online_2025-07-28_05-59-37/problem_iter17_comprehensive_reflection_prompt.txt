{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize Z-normalized synergy of fit/tightness/utilization metrics. Use entropy to measure system balance and adapt weights dynamically based on item size and global variance. Incorporate reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., future flexibility penalties) and predictive entropy delta analysis for optimal bin selection.\nPrioritize hybrid metrics (leftover space + utilization) with weighted sensitivity (e.g., exponential decay). Use tie-breaking via small epsilon adjustments. Avoid static thresholds; adapt strategies contextually but keep logic validated.\n\nPrioritize multi-objective metrics (tight fit + utilization + system entropy), normalize adaptively to current state, use layered tie-breakers (fragility, load balance), and avoid overly simplistic thresholds. Dynamic weight adjustments using variance, item size ratios, or utilization gradients outperform static rules.\n\nEmbed **z-score normalization** for fair metric comparisons, use **dynamic exponential boosts** for high-utilization bins, and integrate **system-wide entropy control** via adaptive weights. Prioritize hierarchical scoring (multi-objective + tie-breaking) with reinforcement-inspired gains over static BF/WF hybrids. Simplistic tie-breakers underperform\u2014favor variance-aware adjustments.\n\nUse adaptive normalization (Z-scores), context-sensitive item classification (small/large), entropy-aware dynamic weights, multi-metric synergy, and predictive variance modeling to design robust heuristics. Prioritize fragmentation reduction through synergy of utilization and fit metrics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize **Z-score synergy** (combining fit/utilization with adaptive weights based on variance ratios). Use **entropy-sensitive penalties** (fragility, balance) modulated by system-level metrics. Integrate **perturbation mechanisms** for tie-breaking and **dynamic enhancers** (e.g., exponential utilization boosting). Document design rationale rigorously for iterative refinement.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
