Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Priority function combining Best Fit for large items and Worst Fit for small items.\"\"\"\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    threshold = 0.5  # Threshold to distinguish large/small items\n    \n    # Best Fit: prioritize bins with least remaining capacity after placement (for large items)\n    best_fit = -(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Worst Fit: prioritize bins with largest remaining capacity (for small items)\n    worst_fit = bins_remain_cap\n    \n    # Select strategy based on item size\n    priority = np.where(item >= threshold, best_fit, worst_fit)\n    \n    # Mask invalid bins and return\n    return np.where(mask, priority, -np.inf)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Priority function combining Best Fit and Worst Fit heuristics based on item size relative to bin capacity.\"\"\"\n    possible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item\n    tight = item > (bins_remain_cap / 2)\n    tight &= possible  # Only consider tightness for bins that can fit the item\n    \n    best_fit = -leftover  # Prioritize minimal leftover for tight fits\n    worst_fit = leftover  # Prioritize largest leftover for non-tight fits\n    \n    priority = np.where(possible, np.where(tight, best_fit, worst_fit), -np.inf)\n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th): The top heuristic combines inverse leftover space and utilization ratio, creating a more nuanced priority than simple hybrid strategies based on mean thresholds. Second-best (3rd) uses exponential decay to heavily penalize non-perfect fits, outperforming the 4th/6th/7th which only use linear leftover space metrics. The 5th improves over the 4th via tie-breaking by utilization (epsilon weighting), while the 12th\u2019s ratio-based approach lacks explicit waste minimization. Hybrid heuristics like the 13th/19th (strategy switches based on item size) perform worse due to simplistic or static thresholds compared to adaptive combinations. Bottom-ranked functions often lack multi-factor integration or overcomplicate logic without validation.\n- \n**Keywords**: Dynamic weight adjustment, adaptive tie-breaking criteria, real-time validation, multi-metric synergy  \n**Advice**: Implement dynamic weight adjustment based on real-time data trends (e.g., reinforcement learning), use adaptive tie-breaking criteria (e.g., entropy-based prioritization), validate strategies via continuous simulation, and integrate complementary metrics (e.g., fragmentation, load balance).  \n**Avoid**: Static epsilon values, precomputed thresholds, unvalidated contextual shifts, and over-reliance on single metrics.  \n**Explanation**: Dynamic adjustments reduce rigidity, adaptive tie-breaking prevents arbitrary choices, real-time validation ensures robustness, and multi-metric synergy balances trade-offs for superior heuristic performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
