- **Keywords**: Multi-objective optimization, hybrid metrics, adaptive normalization, contextual dynamics.  
- **Advice**: Prioritize hierarchical objectives with non-linear sensitivity analysis (e.g., sigmoid or logarithmic decay) and integrate reinforcement learning for parameter calibration.  
- **Avoid**: Static blending ratios, post-hoc rationalization, and over-reliance on single-state snapshots.  
- **Explanation**: Non-linear sensitivity ensures scalable trade-offs; machine learning adapts to systemic unpredictability. Contextual tie-breakers maintain robustness without brittle thresholds.
