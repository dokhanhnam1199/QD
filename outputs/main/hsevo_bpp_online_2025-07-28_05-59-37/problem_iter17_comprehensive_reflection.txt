Keywords: predictive variance modeling, reinforcement learning, non-Z-score normalization, entropy-agnostic balance  
Advice: Use **predictive variance modeling** to anticipate fragmentation risks, **reinforcement learning** for long-term flexibility without entropy penalties, **min-max normalization** over Z-scores to reduce sensitivity to outliers, and **entropy-agnostic balance** via static-dynamic hybrid weights.  
Avoid: Z-score synergy, entropy penalties modulated by system metrics, perturbation-based tie-breaking, exponential utilization boosting.  
Explanation: Avoiding variance-ratio dependency (Z-scores) and system-metric-modulated entropy penalties prevents instability. Predictive variance modeling and reinforcement learning prioritize long-term gains over short-term metrics, while min-max normalization ensures robustness. Epsilon-based tie-breaking (not perturbation) maintains simplicity without introducing noise.
