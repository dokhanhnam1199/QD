Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Priority combining inv_waste, utilization, and exp_waste with adaptive tie-breaking for real-time opt.\"\"\"\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n    if not mask.any():\n        return scores\n    \n    eps = 1e-9\n    remaining = bins_remain_cap[mask]\n    \n    # v0-derived factors: inv_leftover + utilization\n    inv_leftover = 1.0 / (remaining - item + eps)\n    utilization = item / (remaining + eps)\n    \n    # v1-derived exponential sensitivity to waste\n    exp_waste = np.exp(-(remaining - item))\n    \n    # Dynamic synergy: Combine v0's stability with v1's waste-awareness\n    # Weights chosen to preserve metric dominance while allowing adaptive tie-breaking\n    scores[mask] = inv_leftover + utilization + 0.1 * exp_waste\n    return scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority scores combining inverse leftover space, utilization ratio, \n    and exponential decay of leftover space to prioritize tight fits and efficient packing.\n    Adapts synergy across multi-metric factors for better real-time bin selection.\n    \"\"\"\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n    if not mask.any():\n        return scores\n    \n    eps = 1e-9\n    s_j = bins_remain_cap[mask]\n    # Inverse of leftover space (heavily favors tight fits)\n    inv_leftover = 1.0 / (s_j - item + eps)\n    # Item-to-remaining capacity utilization (promotes filling available space)\n    utilization = item / (s_j + eps)\n    # Exponential decay penalty for non-perfect fits (sharp disincentive for large leftover)\n    leftover = s_j - item\n    exp_decay = np.exp(-leftover)  # Normalize by input size for stability if needed\n    \n    # Dynamic synergy: sum of complementary metrics\n    combined = inv_leftover * (1 + utilization) + exp_decay\n    scores[mask] = combined\n    return scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing 1st vs 20th: Best uses multiple adaptive metrics (inv_waste + utilization + exp_waste) vs Worst applies static Best Fit/Worst Fit switching. 2nd vs 19th: Both blend metrics, but 2nd's exponential penalty prevents fragmentation vs 19th's rigid threshold. 3rd vs 18th: Utilization-weighted fit quality outperforms size-based switching by balancing utilization dynamics. 4th vs 17th: Dynamic epsilon adjustment (item size vs average) improves flexibility vs static linear blending. 5th vs 16th: Global state tracking with entropy-aware tie-breaking adapts better than fixed 50% tightness threshold.  \n\nTop heuristics excel through multi-metric synergy (tight fit + system-wide balance + utilization), real-time normalization (dynamic weights via variance/mean), and layered tie-breaking (fragility, entropies). Struggling heuristics oversimplify with rigid thresholds (fixed average/item-based cuts) or suffer from overcomplexity (stateful systems requiring fine-tuned decay windows). Key losers rely on single heuristic hybrids (Best/Worst Fit mixing) without contextual adaptation.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Multi-objective optimization, hybrid metrics, adaptive normalization, contextual dynamics.  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize hierarchical objectives with non-linear sensitivity analysis (e.g., sigmoid or logarithmic decay) and integrate reinforcement learning for parameter calibration.  \n- **Avoid**: Static blending ratios, post-hoc rationalization, and over-reliance on single-state snapshots.  \n- **Explanation**: Non-linear sensitivity ensures scalable trade-offs; machine learning adapts to systemic unpredictability. Contextual tie-breakers maintain robustness without brittle thresholds.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
