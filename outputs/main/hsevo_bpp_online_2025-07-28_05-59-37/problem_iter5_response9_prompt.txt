Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Combines Best Fit with dynamic tie-breaking by utilization ratio scaled adaptively.\n    \n    Uses Best Fit's negative leftover space as primary priority, augmented with a \n    dynamic epsilon-weighted utilization ratio (item/bin_remaining) for tie-breaking.\n    Epsilon scales inversely with leftover standard deviation to balance adaptability \n    and stability.\n    \"\"\"\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item\n    best_fit = -leftover\n    \n    # Dynamic epsilon based on leftover variance (less variance => higher epsilon)\n    valid_leftover = leftover[mask]\n    std = np.std(valid_leftover) if len(valid_leftover) > 1 else 1e-6\n    epsilon = 1e-4 / (std + 1e-9)\n    \n    # Utilization ratio (item / remaining_cap) as adaptive tie-breaker\n    utilization = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=np.float64)\n    np.divide(item, bins_remain_cap, where=mask, out=utilization)\n    \n    # Combined priority with dynamic scaling\n    priority = np.where(mask, best_fit + epsilon * utilization, -np.inf)\n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Combines Best Fit with dynamic hybrid Worst Fit using real-time average to reduce fragility and improve bin usage.\"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on average remaining capacity\n    avg_remaining = np.mean(bins_remain_cap) if bins_remain_cap.size else 1.0\n    \n    # Switch between best-fit and worst-fit based on item size relative to current system state\n    if item > avg_remaining:\n        # Best Fit for larger items: minimize leftover space (directly from v0)\n        priority = np.where(can_fit, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)\n    else:\n        # Worst Fit for smaller items: preserve larger gaps (enhanced by v1's non-tight logic)\n        priority = np.where(can_fit, bins_remain_cap - item, -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing 1st vs 20th: Best uses multiple adaptive metrics (inv_waste + utilization + exp_waste) vs Worst applies static Best Fit/Worst Fit switching. 2nd vs 19th: Both blend metrics, but 2nd's exponential penalty prevents fragmentation vs 19th's rigid threshold. 3rd vs 18th: Utilization-weighted fit quality outperforms size-based switching by balancing utilization dynamics. 4th vs 17th: Dynamic epsilon adjustment (item size vs average) improves flexibility vs static linear blending. 5th vs 16th: Global state tracking with entropy-aware tie-breaking adapts better than fixed 50% tightness threshold.  \n\nTop heuristics excel through multi-metric synergy (tight fit + system-wide balance + utilization), real-time normalization (dynamic weights via variance/mean), and layered tie-breaking (fragility, entropies). Struggling heuristics oversimplify with rigid thresholds (fixed average/item-based cuts) or suffer from overcomplexity (stateful systems requiring fine-tuned decay windows). Key losers rely on single heuristic hybrids (Best/Worst Fit mixing) without contextual adaptation.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Multi-objective optimization, hybrid metrics, adaptive normalization, contextual dynamics.  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize hierarchical objectives with non-linear sensitivity analysis (e.g., sigmoid or logarithmic decay) and integrate reinforcement learning for parameter calibration.  \n- **Avoid**: Static blending ratios, post-hoc rationalization, and over-reliance on single-state snapshots.  \n- **Explanation**: Non-linear sensitivity ensures scalable trade-offs; machine learning adapts to systemic unpredictability. Contextual tie-breakers maintain robustness without brittle thresholds.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
