**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristics use Z-score normalization across multiple metrics (fit, capacity, utilization), entropy-driven balance, and reinforcement learning concepts, while the worst rely on simpler adaptive weights without comprehensive normalization. (4th) vs (16th) shows that predictive entropy delta analysis and variance forecasting improve performance over basic entropy factors. (8th) vs (19th) highlights that gradient-enhanced scoring with dynamic item classification outperforms static penalty tiers. Overall, superior heuristics integrate **multi-metric Z-synergy**, **entropy-weighted fragmentation control**, **system variance adaptation**, and **reinforcement-style future-state prediction** to balance tight fits with long-term flexibility.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize Z-normalized synergy of fit/tightness/utilization metrics. Use entropy to measure system balance and adapt weights dynamically based on item size and global variance. Incorporate reinforcement learning concepts (e.g., future flexibility penalties) and predictive entropy delta analysis for optimal bin selection.
