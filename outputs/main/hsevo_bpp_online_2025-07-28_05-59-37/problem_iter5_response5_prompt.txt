Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Struggling heuristics oversimplify with rigid thresholds (fixed average/item-based cuts) or suffer from overcomplexity (stateful systems requiring fine-tuned decay windows). Key losers rely on single heuristic hybrids (Best/Worst Fit mixing) without contextual adaptation.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Multi-objective optimization, hybrid metrics, adaptive normalization, contextual dynamics.  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize hierarchical objectives with non-linear sensitivity analysis (e.g., sigmoid or logarithmic decay) and integrate reinforcement learning for parameter calibration.  \n- **Avoid**: Static blending ratios, post-hoc rationalization, and over-reliance on single-state snapshots.  \n- **Explanation**: Non-linear sensitivity ensures scalable trade-offs; machine learning adapts to systemic unpredictability. Contextual tie-breakers maintain robustness without brittle thresholds.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
