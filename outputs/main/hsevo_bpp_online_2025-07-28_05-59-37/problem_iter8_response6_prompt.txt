Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd) vs (3rd) reveals the criticality of hybrid metrics (e.g., z-fit + z-cap) over basic inverse/exp combinations. (5th-7th) incorporate **system-wide entropy and fragmentation control** via adaptive balance weights, which are absent in mid-tier heuristics. Top performers prioritize **multi-layered synergy** (e.g., tightness \u00d7 utilization \u00d7 exponential enhancers) and **reinforcement-inspired gains**, while lower ranks rely on basic BF/WF blending. Worst heuristics (e.g., 19th/20th) lack nuanced tie-breaking (e.g., variance minimization) and system-aware adjustments.\n- \n**Keywords:** Z-score normalization, dynamic exponential boosting, entropy control, hierarchical scoring  \n**Advice:** Embed **state-aware normalization** to balance metric scales, pair **gradient-driven boosting** with entropy-based decay for bin prioritization, and apply **multi-layer tie-breakers** (e.g., fragility + load balance) with epsilon-perturbed thresholds. Use **cross-metric variance analysis** to dynamically adjust weights.  \n**Avoid:** Static thresholds, single-axis tie-breakers, unbounded normalization ranges.  \n**Explanation:** Combining adaptive normalization, gradient-aware dynamics, and entropy-sensitive hierarchies ensures context-specific responsiveness while avoiding brittle rules. Perturbed thresholds and cross-metric variance mitigate overfitting, validating gains without overcomplicating logic.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
