Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                epsilon= 2.780937089328302e-07,\n                balance_score_factor= 0.15952587139885877,\n                exp_waste_weight= 0.9080741648416655,\n                frag_penalty_true= 0.29218904894466113,\n                frag_penalty_false= -0.9052832080130657,\n                tiebreaker_weight= 0.023949968005968523,\n                entropy_threshold= 1.0827284568657862,\n                balance_weight_base= 0.30810252338568467,\n                median_adjustment_factor= 0.7690926682615311) -> np.ndarray:\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n    if not mask.any():\n        return scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Priority combines Best Fit (leftover minimization) and Worst Fit (remaining space maximization) dynamically.\n    Weighting adjusts based on item's relative size to current maximum bin capacity estimate.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(bins_remain_cap) == 0:\n        return np.array([], dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    C_est = bins_remain_cap.max()\n    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if not np.any(valid):\n        return -np.inf * np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    relative_size = item / C_est\n    weight = relative_size ** 2  # Dynamic weight emphasizes Best Fit for larger items\n    \n    # Blend Best Fit and Worst Fit: [0, 1] weight on Best Fit, [1, 0] on Worst Fit\n    priorities = np.where(valid,\n                          weight * (item - bins_remain_cap) + (1 - weight) * bins_remain_cap,\n                          -np.inf)\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing 1st vs 20th: Best uses multiple adaptive metrics (inv_waste + utilization + exp_waste) vs Worst applies static Best Fit/Worst Fit switching. 2nd vs 19th: Both blend metrics, but 2nd's exponential penalty prevents fragmentation vs 19th's rigid threshold. 3rd vs 18th: Utilization-weighted fit quality outperforms size-based switching by balancing utilization dynamics. 4th vs 17th: Dynamic epsilon adjustment (item size vs average) improves flexibility vs static linear blending. 5th vs 16th: Global state tracking with entropy-aware tie-breaking adapts better than fixed 50% tightness threshold.  \n\nTop heuristics excel through multi-metric synergy (tight fit + system-wide balance + utilization), real-time normalization (dynamic weights via variance/mean), and layered tie-breaking (fragility, entropies). Struggling heuristics oversimplify with rigid thresholds (fixed average/item-based cuts) or suffer from overcomplexity (stateful systems requiring fine-tuned decay windows). Key losers rely on single heuristic hybrids (Best/Worst Fit mixing) without contextual adaptation.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Multi-objective optimization, hybrid metrics, adaptive normalization, contextual dynamics.  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize hierarchical objectives with non-linear sensitivity analysis (e.g., sigmoid or logarithmic decay) and integrate reinforcement learning for parameter calibration.  \n- **Avoid**: Static blending ratios, post-hoc rationalization, and over-reliance on single-state snapshots.  \n- **Explanation**: Non-linear sensitivity ensures scalable trade-offs; machine learning adapts to systemic unpredictability. Contextual tie-breakers maintain robustness without brittle thresholds.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
