Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(4th) vs (16th) shows that predictive entropy delta analysis and variance forecasting improve performance over basic entropy factors. (8th) vs (19th) highlights that gradient-enhanced scoring with dynamic item classification outperforms static penalty tiers. Overall, superior heuristics integrate **multi-metric Z-synergy**, **entropy-weighted fragmentation control**, **system variance adaptation**, and **reinforcement-style future-state prediction** to balance tight fits with long-term flexibility.\n- \nKeywords: predictive variance modeling, reinforcement learning, non-Z-score normalization, entropy-agnostic balance  \nAdvice: Use **predictive variance modeling** to anticipate fragmentation risks, **reinforcement learning** for long-term flexibility without entropy penalties, **min-max normalization** over Z-scores to reduce sensitivity to outliers, and **entropy-agnostic balance** via static-dynamic hybrid weights.  \nAvoid: Z-score synergy, entropy penalties modulated by system metrics, perturbation-based tie-breaking, exponential utilization boosting.  \nExplanation: Avoiding variance-ratio dependency (Z-scores) and system-metric-modulated entropy penalties prevents instability. Predictive variance modeling and reinforcement learning prioritize long-term gains over short-term metrics, while min-max normalization ensures robustness. Epsilon-based tie-breaking (not perturbation) maintains simplicity without introducing noise.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
