{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize multi-objective metrics (tight fit + utilization + system entropy), normalize adaptively to current state, use layered tie-breakers (fragility, load balance), and avoid overly simplistic thresholds. Dynamic weight adjustments using variance, item size ratios, or utilization gradients outperform static rules.\nPrioritize hybrid metrics (leftover space + utilization) with weighted sensitivity (e.g., exponential decay). Use tie-breaking via small epsilon adjustments. Avoid static thresholds; adapt strategies contextually but keep logic validated.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
