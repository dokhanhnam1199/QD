**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see top heuristics use **z-score normalization** and **exponential utilization enhancement** to dynamically adjust priorities, while simpler sigmoid blending in worst heuristics lacks depth. (2nd) vs (3rd) reveals the criticality of hybrid metrics (e.g., z-fit + z-cap) over basic inverse/exp combinations. (5th-7th) incorporate **system-wide entropy and fragmentation control** via adaptive balance weights, which are absent in mid-tier heuristics. Top performers prioritize **multi-layered synergy** (e.g., tightness × utilization × exponential enhancers) and **reinforcement-inspired gains**, while lower ranks rely on basic BF/WF blending. Worst heuristics (e.g., 19th/20th) lack nuanced tie-breaking (e.g., variance minimization) and system-aware adjustments.  

**Experience:**  
Embed **z-score normalization** for fair metric comparisons, use **dynamic exponential boosts** for high-utilization bins, and integrate **system-wide entropy control** via adaptive weights. Prioritize hierarchical scoring (multi-objective + tie-breaking) with reinforcement-inspired gains over static BF/WF hybrids. Simplistic tie-breakers underperform—favor variance-aware adjustments.
