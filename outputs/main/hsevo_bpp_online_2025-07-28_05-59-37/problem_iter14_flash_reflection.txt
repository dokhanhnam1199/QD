**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see the top heuristics use advanced Z-score synergy, item-class adaptation, and predictive entropy modeling. (second best) vs (second worst) reveals superior fragmentation control through multi-metric variance analysis. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical (possible duplication). (3rd) vs (4th) shows more sophisticated entropy scaling in higher-ranked functions. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both lack dynamic weight optimization found in top heuristics. Overall: superior heuristics balance adaptive normalization, context-aware penalties, and multi-layered sensitivity to system entropy.

**Experience:**
Use adaptive normalization (Z-scores), context-sensitive item classification (small/large), entropy-aware dynamic weights, multi-metric synergy, and predictive variance modeling to design robust heuristics. Prioritize fragmentation reduction through synergy of utilization and fit metrics.
