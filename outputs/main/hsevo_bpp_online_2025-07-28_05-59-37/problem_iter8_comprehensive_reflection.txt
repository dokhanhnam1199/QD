**Keywords:** Z-score normalization, dynamic exponential boosting, entropy control, hierarchical scoring  
**Advice:** Embed **state-aware normalization** to balance metric scales, pair **gradient-driven boosting** with entropy-based decay for bin prioritization, and apply **multi-layer tie-breakers** (e.g., fragility + load balance) with epsilon-perturbed thresholds. Use **cross-metric variance analysis** to dynamically adjust weights.  
**Avoid:** Static thresholds, single-axis tie-breakers, unbounded normalization ranges.  
**Explanation:** Combining adaptive normalization, gradient-aware dynamics, and entropy-sensitive hierarchies ensures context-specific responsiveness while avoiding brittle rules. Perturbed thresholds and cross-metric variance mitigate overfitting, validating gains without overcomplicating logic.
