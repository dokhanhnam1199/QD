{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize **Z-score synergy** (combining fit/utilization with adaptive weights based on variance ratios). Use **entropy-sensitive penalties** (fragility, balance) modulated by system-level metrics. Integrate **perturbation mechanisms** for tie-breaking and **dynamic enhancers** (e.g., exponential utilization boosting). Document design rationale rigorously for iterative refinement.\nPrioritize hybrid metrics (leftover space + utilization) with weighted sensitivity (e.g., exponential decay). Use tie-breaking via small epsilon adjustments. Avoid static thresholds; adapt strategies contextually but keep logic validated.\n\nPrioritize multi-objective metrics (tight fit + utilization + system entropy), normalize adaptively to current state, use layered tie-breakers (fragility, load balance), and avoid overly simplistic thresholds. Dynamic weight adjustments using variance, item size ratios, or utilization gradients outperform static rules.\n\nEmbed **z-score normalization** for fair metric comparisons, use **dynamic exponential boosts** for high-utilization bins, and integrate **system-wide entropy control** via adaptive weights. Prioritize hierarchical scoring (multi-objective + tie-breaking) with reinforcement-inspired gains over static BF/WF hybrids. Simplistic tie-breakers underperform\u2014favor variance-aware adjustments.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
