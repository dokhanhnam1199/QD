Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The 1st uses adaptive frag weight (sys_entropy), while 18th uses fixed exponential penalty.  \n(4th) vs (19th): 4th implements **cross-metric variance adaptation** (synergy = z_tight * (1 + z_util)) and adaptive frag weights, whereas 19th uses simpler median alignment without dynamic entropy scaling.  \n(11th) vs (20th): Both lack unique features of top heuristics like perturbed thresholds and gradient-boosted enhancer. 11th's entropy-regularized tiebreakers are less nuanced than top-ranked heuristics.  \nComparing (1st) vs (4th): The former uses layered priortization with perturbed thresholds and exponential utilization enhancer, while the latter emphasizes entropy-adjusted frag penalty. Top heuristics excel in **hierarchical reinforcement** and **dynamic hybrid weighting**.\n- \n**Keywords**: Z-score synergy, entropy-sensitive penalties, perturbation mechanisms, dynamic weight optimization  \n**Advice**: Embrace reinforcement-inspired gain adaptation for hierarchical metrics, integrate predictive entropy modeling to anticipate system imbalance, refine tie-breaking via multi-dimensional sensitivity (e.g., combining variance and gradient metrics), and leverage meta-heuristics for self-adjusting weight gradients.  \n**Avoid**: Precomputed weight distributions, rigid penalization structures, low-resolution thresholds, or scale-agnostic normalization.  \n**Explanation**: These strategies enhance adaptability and foresight in dynamic environments, balancing short-term fit with long-term system resilience while mitigating overfitting to transient states.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
