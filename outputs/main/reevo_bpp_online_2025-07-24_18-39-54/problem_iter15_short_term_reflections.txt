To design better heuristics, simplify calculations, directly use meaningful metrics, and control noise for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Normalizing priorities and adding controlled noise can balance exploitation and exploration. Simplify functions to improve performance.
Adaptive noise scaling based on problem context and using meaningful priority calculations can significantly improve heuristic performance.
Simpler normalization and noise addition can improve performance; consider using negative remaining capacity and a small noise scale.
Use meaningful priority functions and normalize valid priorities properly to design better heuristics for online bin packing.
Simplify priority functions and directly optimize for the objective; controlled noise can aid exploration.
Adaptive noise scaling and informed priority calculation can enhance heuristic performance in online bin packing problems.
Feature engineering and weighted combination improve heuristics; consider normalization and controlled noise for better exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Use relative remaining capacity and controlled noise for exploration to design better heuristics for online bin packing problems.
Simplify features, reduce dimensionality, and directly optimize the priority score for better performance in online bin packing.
