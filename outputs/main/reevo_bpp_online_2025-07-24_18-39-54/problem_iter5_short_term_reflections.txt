Use meaningful scoring criteria and consider multiple factors to differentiate bins and improve the heuristic's effectiveness.
Prioritize bins that fit items tightly by using remaining capacity after addition as a priority metric.
Simplicity and deterministic tie-breaking can improve heuristic performance; avoid unnecessary randomness and complex scoring.
To design better heuristics, consider multiple factors and use nuanced scoring like the better code's combined metric.
Consider multi-factor scoring and nuanced priority assignment to differentiate between feasible and optimal bin choices.
Design better heuristics by prioritizing bins with the least remaining capacity after item addition to minimize waste.
Use meaningful score components like remaining capacity and item-bin fit to design more effective priority functions.
Design better heuristics by prioritizing bins with least remaining capacity and handling edge cases effectively.
Use a more informed priority function and normalize scores. Introduce controlled randomness to break ties effectively.
For better heuristics, favor exploiting problem structure and use noise strategically to break ties when necessary.
