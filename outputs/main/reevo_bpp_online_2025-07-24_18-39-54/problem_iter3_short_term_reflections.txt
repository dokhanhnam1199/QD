Simpler priority functions can be more effective; focus on exploiting the problem structure and key influential factors.
Design heuristics by analyzing problem characteristics and balancing exploration-exploitation trade-offs to maximize solution quality.
Combining multiple relevant factors and fine-tuning their interactions can lead to more effective heuristics.
Focus on simplicity and clear objectives; avoid mixing multiple heuristics; scale priorities appropriately for comparability.
Prioritize bins with the least remaining capacity after addition and use randomness to break ties for better performance.
To design better heuristics, focus on normalization and handling edge cases like "no valid bins" to improve performance.
Simplify priority functions and introduce noise to break ties, as seen in the better code's use of randomness.
To design better heuristics, analyze the problem structure, and utilize problem-specific insights to guide priority function design.
Normalize the priority scores and focus on the most relevant factors, like remaining capacity ratio.
Emphasize packing efficiency by utilizing relative remaining capacity, and use masking to handle invalid bin assignments effectively.
