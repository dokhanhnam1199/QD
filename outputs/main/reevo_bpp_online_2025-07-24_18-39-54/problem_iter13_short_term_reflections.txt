Design better heuristics by using multiple informative features and combining them in a meaningful way with normalization.
Use relative remaining capacity, normalize valid bins, and clip noisy priorities to improve heuristics for online bin packing problems.
Simplify priority functions, focus on meaningful features, and balance exploitation and exploration for better heuristic design.
Use a combination of remaining capacity and fit criteria to design a more informed priority function for better heuristics.
Use a combination of problem-specific features and fine-tune their weighting to design better heuristics for online bin packing.
Normalization and controlled noise addition improve heuristic performance by scaling priorities and avoiding identical scores.
Normalize priorities and add noise to break ties and explore different packing configurations.
Use multiple relevant features, normalize them, and combine with controlled noise for effective exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Adaptive noise scaling based on item size and valid bins improves heuristic performance by balancing exploration and exploitation.
Use meaningful priority functions and controlled noise for exploration. Normalize priorities and avoid unnecessary parameters.
