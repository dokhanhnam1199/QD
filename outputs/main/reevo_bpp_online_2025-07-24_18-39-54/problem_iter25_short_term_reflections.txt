Use meaningful, non-normalized values and combine multiple relevant factors to create a more informative priority score.
Simpler, more relevant calculations and normalization, along with suitable noise distribution, improve heuristic performance.
To design better heuristics, simplify and differentiate priority calculations for feasible bins while maintaining exploration-exploitation balance.
Simplify priority functions by directly optimizing the objective and removing unnecessary normalizations and explorations.
Simplify priority functions, directly relate priorities to problem objectives, and control noise for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Simplify calculations, normalize priorities only for valid bins, and use uniform noise for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Normalize valid priorities, invert to prioritize tighter fits, and add controlled noise for exploration-exploitation balance.
Simplify priority functions, normalize inputs, and add controlled noise for exploration to design better heuristics for online BPP.
Normalize inputs and adjust priority calculations to better reflect problem objectives, and add noise for exploration.
Simplify priority functions and avoid unnecessary normalization and noise addition for better performance in online bin packing.
