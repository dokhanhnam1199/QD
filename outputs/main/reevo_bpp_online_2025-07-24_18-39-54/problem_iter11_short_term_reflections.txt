To design better heuristics, simplify and directly optimize the priority function without unnecessary normalization steps.
Use relative remaining capacity and controlled noise for exploration, and normalize priorities within a comparable range.
Simplify the priority function, directly using remaining capacities and controlled noise, while avoiding unnecessary normalization and clipping.
Adaptive noise scaling with problem-dependent factors can significantly enhance heuristic performance in Online Bin Packing.
Simplify noise addition and normalization checks to improve heuristic performance, avoiding unnecessary computations and division by zero.
Use meaningful scoring functions and combine multiple relevant factors to create more effective heuristics.
Simplify priority functions and focus on meaningful problem-related features to design better heuristics for online bin packing.
Simplify and focus on relevant problem features; avoid unnecessary normalization and noise; leverage meaningful priority differentiators.
To design better heuristics, consider normalization, controlled randomness, and epsilon values to avoid division by zero.
Normalizing and adding noise to priority scores can improve heuristics by breaking ties and exploring different packing options.
