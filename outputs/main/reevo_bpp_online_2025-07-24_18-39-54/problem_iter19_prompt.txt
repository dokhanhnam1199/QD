BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nTo design better heuristics for online Bin Packing, simplify priority functions focusing on the problem's objective, normalize priorities for valid bins, and add controlled noise. Ensure numerical stability and balance exploration-exploitation by controlling randomness and using a small epsilon to prevent division by zero.\n\n[Code]\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remaining_capacities = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Assign a very low priority to bins that cannot fit the item\n    priorities = np.where(remaining_capacities >= 0, -np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item), -1e6)\n    \n    # To further differentiate bins that can fit the item, we use a combination of \n    # the remaining capacity and the absolute difference between the remaining capacity and the item size\n    priorities = np.where(remaining_capacities >= 0, priorities + remaining_capacities / (1 + np.abs(remaining_capacities - item)), priorities)\n    \n    return priorities\n\n[Improved code]\nPlease write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection.
