Normalize priorities globally and control randomness for better consistency and consider fixed seeds for reproducibility.
Normalization and noise addition should be carefully applied to valid bins and controlled in scale.
Controlling randomness with a fixed seed enhances reproducibility and can lead to better performance in online bin packing heuristics.
Proper normalization and controlled randomness improve heuristic performance. Scale randomness according to normalized priority range.
Normalize priorities across all bins, not just valid ones, and ensure controlled randomness for reproducibility.
Proper normalization and controlled randomness help. Avoid unnecessary operations and ensure reproducibility isn't compromised unnecessarily.
Normalize across all bins, not just valid ones, and use controlled randomness for reproducibility.
Proper normalization and controlled randomness improve heuristic performance; consider feature scaling and perturbation techniques for better results.
Proper normalization and controlled randomness improve the heuristic. Scale priorities to a comparable range and avoid extreme values.
Normalize valid priorities to a consistent range and adjust randomness scale accordingly for better performance.
