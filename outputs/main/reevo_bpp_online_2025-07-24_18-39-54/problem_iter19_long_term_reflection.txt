To design better heuristics for online Bin Packing, simplify priority functions focusing on the problem's objective, normalize priorities for valid bins, and add controlled noise. Ensure numerical stability and balance exploration-exploitation by controlling randomness and using a small epsilon to prevent division by zero.
