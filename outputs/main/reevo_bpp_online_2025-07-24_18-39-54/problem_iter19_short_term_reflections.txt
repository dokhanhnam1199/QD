Normalization after adding noise may disrupt exploration; try normalizing before adding noise for more controlled exploration.
Simplify the priority function by focusing on the problem's objective and removing unnecessary exploration noise.
Normalize priorities only for valid bins and add controlled noise to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation.
Simplify priority functions and focus on exploiting the problem structure rather than relying on exploration noise.
Simplify priority functions and focus on exploiting the problem structure, reducing unnecessary noise and normalization.
Normalize priorities and control randomness level for better exploration-exploitation balance in heuristics.
Favor simplicity and meaningful scoring; avoid unnecessary noise unless it serves an exploration-exploitation purpose effectively.
Normalization enhances numerical stability, and controlled noise aids exploration. Separate noise scale allows flexibility and tuning.
Simplify the priority function by removing unnecessary normalization and noise, focusing on the core problem logic.
Avoid conditional normalization and use a small epsilon to prevent division by zero for better numerical stability.
