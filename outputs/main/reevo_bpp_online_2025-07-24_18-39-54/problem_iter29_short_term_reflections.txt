Tuning priority normalization and adding noise with suitable distribution can significantly improve heuristics for online Bin Packing Problem.
Simplify priority calculations and directly use meaningful variables to improve readability and performance.
Normalize priorities based on relative waste or fitness, and adjust noise addition to valid bins for better exploration-exploitation.
Use meaningful priority functions that consider both item size and bin remaining capacity to guide the packing decision.
Normalizing priorities and adding controlled noise can improve heuristic performance by balancing exploitation and exploration.
Normalize priorities within valid bins, invert to prioritize tighter fits, and add controlled noise for exploration-exploitation balance.
To design better heuristics, normalize scores and adjust exploration-exploitation balance with controlled noise.
Normalize valid bin priorities and use small, controlled noise for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Normalize scores and add controlled noise for better exploration-exploitation balance, ensuring numerical stability with clipping.
To design better heuristics, balance exploitation and exploration, and normalize scores to differentiate between valid options.
