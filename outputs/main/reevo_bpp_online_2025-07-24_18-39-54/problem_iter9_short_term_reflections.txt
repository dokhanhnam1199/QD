Use absolute differences and controlled noise effectively, normalize priorities, and handle edge cases for better heuristic performance.
Check edge cases, avoid unnecessary computations, and scale noise appropriately to enhance heuristic performance and robustness.
To design better heuristics, analyze differences between versions, focusing on normalization and noise addition techniques.
Use normalized priorities and controlled noise, avoid fixed scaling, and adapt to valid priority ranges for better heuristic design.
Use absolute difference and controlled noise, and avoid division by zero to design better priority functions for online bin packing.
Use absolute differences with a negative sign, and scale noise adaptively to improve priority function effectiveness.
Simplifying priority functions and leveraging problem-specific insights can lead to more effective heuristics than introducing randomness.
Normalize priorities only for valid bins and add controlled randomness within a reasonable range to break ties effectively.
Use absolute differences, normalization, and controlled noise; ensure reproducibility with seeds and clip noisy priorities.
Normalize valid priorities and add moderate noise to break ties, improving exploration and exploitation balance.
