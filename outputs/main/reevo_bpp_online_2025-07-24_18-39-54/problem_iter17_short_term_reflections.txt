Use a mask to check bin capacity before division to avoid unnecessary computations and ensure numerical stability.
Use relative remaining capacities and controlled noise for exploration; consider normalization and clipping to improve heuristic performance.
To design better heuristics, simplify and directly focus on the core logic, reducing unnecessary complexity and noise.
Simplify priority functions, use negative remaining capacity, and controlled noise for exploration to design better heuristics.
Normalize priorities, control noise scale, and clip scores to enhance exploration-exploitation balance and heuristic performance.
Normalize priorities for valid bins and add small noise for exploration to avoid excessive randomness and ensure stability.
Simplify the priority function by removing unnecessary complexity, and use stable normalization to improve performance.
Simpler priority functions can be more effective; focus on exploiting the problem structure rather than adding noise or normalization.
Simplify the priority function and focus on exploiting the problem structure rather than introducing random noise.
Ensure reproducibility by fixing the random seed for exploration-exploitation balance and analyze its impact on overall performance.
