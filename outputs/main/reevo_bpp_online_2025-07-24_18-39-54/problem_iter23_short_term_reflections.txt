Normalize inputs and use meaningful scoring functions. Carefully balance exploration and exploitation with controlled noise.
Normalizing remaining capacities after adding the item and ensuring numerical stability improves heuristics performance.
Simplify priority functions and directly optimize the objective. Avoid unnecessary normalization and noise unless proven beneficial.
Normalize inputs and simplify priority calculations for numerical stability and better performance in online bin packing heuristics.
Simplify priority functions, directly correlate with problem objectives, and avoid unnecessary normalization or noise introduction.
Normalize after filtering invalid bins and use uniform noise for better exploration-exploitation balance in priority functions.
Simplify and directly utilize the problem's objective; reduce unnecessary normalization and introduce meaningful differentiation.
Normalization enhances numerical stability, and introducing controlled noise balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
Normalization and controlled noise enhance heuristics by balancing exploitation and exploration, improving adaptability in uncertain environments.
Normalizing priorities and adding controlled noise helps. Simplifying priority calculation and using epsilon prevents division by zero.
