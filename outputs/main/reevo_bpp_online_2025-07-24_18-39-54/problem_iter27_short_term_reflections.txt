Simplify priority functions and directly utilize relevant problem properties for better performance.
Normalization and noise addition should be done carefully, only on valid bins, to improve exploration-exploitation balance.
Simplify the priority function by directly relating it to the objective and normalizing valid priorities.
Normalize relevant values, use objective-related scores, and add controlled noise for exploration-exploitation balance in priority functions.
Prioritize tighter fits by inverting normalized priorities and add controlled noise for exploration-exploitation balance.
Use meaningful factors, avoid normalization when unnecessary, and tune noise scale for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Design better heuristics by aligning priority functions with the optimization objective and utilizing meaningful normalization.
Normalize priorities for valid bins and introduce controlled noise to balance exploration and exploitation effectively.
Normalize scores and add noise for exploration-exploitation balance to improve heuristics, as seen in the better code version.
Design heuristics that directly utilize problem-relevant quantities and consider noise injection for exploration.
