Prioritize exact fits. For near fits, use scaled softmax on inverse remaining capacity.
Prioritize exact fits, then explore smaller remaining capacities. Simplicity often wins.
Prioritize tighter fits. Simpler, greedy strategies often outperform complex ones.
Prioritize exact fits, use softmax with inverse remaining capacity.
Prioritize tighter fits to encourage denser packing.
Prioritize exact fits directly; avoid softmax for greedy choices.
Prioritize exact fits, use temperature for exploration, and favor minimal slack.
Prioritize exact fits, use softmax for near fits, and explore tunable scaling.
Prioritize minimal slack, penalize exact fits, and explore small positive remainders.
Prioritize minimal slack for dense packing. Explore varying score transformations.
