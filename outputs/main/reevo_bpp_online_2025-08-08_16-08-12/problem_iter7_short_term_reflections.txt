Prioritize exact fits, then near fits. Explore options with a temperature.
Focus on tight fits (minimal remainder) and explore cautiously.
Prioritize exact fits, then near fits. Avoid complex exploration for simple priority.
Prioritize exact fits, then near fits. Introduce exploration via softmax for better performance.
Prioritize exact fits, use softmax for balanced exploration and exploitation.
Prioritize exact fits, then best fits. Explore less often, or explore based on remaining capacity.
Prioritize tight fits for exploitation. Explore less greedily for diverse solutions.
Prioritize tightest fits. Balance exploitation and exploration carefully.
Prioritize minimal slack, penalize exact fills, balance greedy and exploratory.
Prioritize minimal slack, balance density with flexibility, and consider future item compatibility.
