BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Prioritizes bins for the online Bin Packing Problem using a hybrid approach\n    that balances \"Best Fit\" (exploitation) with a small chance of \"First Fit\"\n    or random choice among fitting bins (exploration).\n\n    The \"Best Fit\" component prioritizes bins that leave the least remaining\n    capacity after the item is placed. This is achieved by assigning a priority\n    that is the negative of the remaining capacity after fitting the item.\n    A tighter fit (smaller remaining capacity) results in a higher (less negative)\n    priority.\n\n    The exploration component is introduced to prevent getting stuck in local\n    optima. With a small probability (epsilon), it favors bins that are not\n    necessarily the best fit, by assigning a random priority among those that\n    can fit the item.
