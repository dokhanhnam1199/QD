```python
def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Prioritizes bins using the "Best Fit" heuristic for the online Bin Packing Problem.

    This heuristic aims to find the bin that, after placing the item, will have the
    least remaining capacity (i.e., the tightest fit) among all bins that can
    accommodate the item. It prioritizes bins that are closer to being full.
    An exact fit (remaining capacity == item size) is implicitly handled as
    it results in zero remaining capacity, which is the minimum possible.

    The priority is calculated as:
    - For bins that can fit the item: a value inversely proportional to the
      remaining capacity after placing the item (i.e., -(bins_remain_cap - item)).
      This means bins with less remaining capacity (tighter fit) get higher priorities.
      The highest priority is given to the bin with the smallest non-negative
      remaining capacity after placing the item.
    - For bins that cannot fit the item: a priority of 0.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.

    Returns:
        A numpy array of the same size as bins_remain_cap, where each element
        represents the priority score for placing the item in the corresponding bin.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that have enough capacity to fit the item
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For bins that can fit the item, calculate the remaining capacity after packing
    remaining_capacities_after_fit = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # Assign priorities. Higher priority for smaller remaining capacity (tighter fit).
    # We use the negative of the remaining capacity so that the minimum remaining
    # capacity (tightest fit) gets the highest positive priority.
    # If a bin has remaining_capacity - item = 0 (exact fit), its priority contribution is 0.
    # If remaining_capacity - item = 5, its priority contribution is -5.
    # The largest negative value will correspond to the smallest remaining capacity.
