Prioritize exact fits, explore near fits with a controlled mechanism.
Prioritize exact fits, use negative remaining capacity for softmax, and adjust temperature.
Use softmax for smoother exploration, unlike epsilon-greedy's abrupt switch.
Favor exact fits, then prioritize minimal remaining capacity for denser packing.
Prioritize tight fits. Explore fewer options; focus on greedy, direct improvements.
Prioritize minimal slack, explore options, and consider future item sizes.
Prioritize tight fits, but smooth for exploration using temperature or noise.
Prioritize exact fits. Use softmax for exploration. Tune scaling and temperature.
Prioritize minimal slack, penalize exact fills, explore slightly larger remainders.
Prioritize exact fits, then near fits. Explore with softmax for better results.
