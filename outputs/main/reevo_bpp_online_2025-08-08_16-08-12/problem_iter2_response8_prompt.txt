BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

If a bin has enough remaining capacity to hold the item, it's a candidate.\n    2. Among the candidate bins, priority is assigned randomly. This introduces\n       an element of exploration, as it doesn't deterministically pick the\n       'best' fitting bin every time.
