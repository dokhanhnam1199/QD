Prioritize smaller gaps for 'Almost Full Fit', exact fits are a special case.
Prioritize tighter fits to leave space for larger future items.
Prioritize minimal positive residual capacity for best fit.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity that can still fit the item.
Favor exact fits, then minimize slack for better packing.
Prioritize smaller gaps for better fit, use softmax for smooth probability distribution.
Balance greedy "best fit" with exploration for robust performance.
Prioritize bins by maximizing fit and minimizing waste. Consider exploration.
Prioritize exact fits. For others, use slack. Randomness is less effective.
Balance exploitation (good fit) with exploration (trying other bins).
