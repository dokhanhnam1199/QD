Prioritize exact fits, scale slack to emphasize tighter packing, and use bounded transformations.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize slack, and avoid unnecessary temperature scaling.
Tune temperature, scale softmax outputs, handle exact fits separately.
Emphasize exact fits, penalize larger remaining capacities more aggressively.
Prioritize exact fits, explore near fits with controlled scaling and stable softmax.
Prioritize exact fits. Emphasize smaller remaining capacities more aggressively.
**Heuristic Design Hints:**

*   **Categorize fits:** Differentiate exact, near, and general fits.
*   **Tune scores:** Adjust priorities between categories.
*   **Softmax control:** Use temperature for exploration.
*   **Avoid zero:** Use epsilon for division.
*   **Meaningful defaults:** Assign low priorities for usable bins.
*   **Numerical stability:** Shift scores before softmax.
Prioritize exact fits. Tune softmax scaling for near fits, favoring tighter packing.
Prioritize smaller remaining capacity, favor exact fits, and experiment with inverse/exponential transformations.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize remaining capacity. Use negative remaining capacity as a direct priority.
