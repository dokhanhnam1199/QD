Prioritize exact or near-exact fits to leave larger gaps for future items.
Prioritize exact fits. Then use best fit. Avoid penalizing good fits.
Prioritize minimal slack, but penalize exact fits to encourage flexibility.
Prioritize exact fits first, then near-fits. Avoid complex penalties.
Focus on tight fits, minimize waste. Exploit good fits, explore others.
Focus on the "gap" for best fit. Softmax for exploration. Fine-tune temperature.
Prioritize exact fits, then tight fits, while ensuring clear differentiation.
Prioritize exact fits and minimize positive residual capacity for better BPP heuristics.
Prioritize tight fits. Avoid exploration unless necessary.
Focus on the "tightest fit" for better greedy choices. Avoid random exploration.
