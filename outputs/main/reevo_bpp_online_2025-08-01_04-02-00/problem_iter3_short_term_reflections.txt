Prefer simpler, linear priority transformations. Avoid non-linear functions that exaggerate small differences, improving robustness.
Prefer linear over inverse scaling for remaining capacity in priority functions for better robustness.
Carefully choose epsilon for numerical stability, preventing over-differentiation and improving robustness.
Prefer linear priority transformations; avoid non-linear scales that exaggerate small differences for robustness.
Prefer simple, direct waste minimization. Linear priority functions are often more robust than aggressive non-linear transformations.
Prefer direct, linear objective functions; avoid complex non-linear transformations that disproportionately scale priorities.
Linear priority (negative remaining space) better reflects Best Fit; inverse functions can exaggerate small differences.
Prioritize simpler, numerically robust functions. Direct mapping of minimization goals (e.g., negative value) is often superior.
Prefer linear priority mappings (e.g., `-cost`) over non-linear ones (e.g., `1/cost`) for better performance.
Prefer simple, direct, and linear transformations of objective functions for more robust and effective heuristics.
