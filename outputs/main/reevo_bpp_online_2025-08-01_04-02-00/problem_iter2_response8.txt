    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,
    implementing a Best Fit (BF) strategy. This heuristic aims to minimize
    the unused space within a bin after the item is placed. Bins that can
    fit the item and leave the least remaining capacity will have higher
    priority. Bins that cannot fit the item are given a very low priority.

    This version specifically adheres to preferring linear priority mappings
    (e.g., -cost) over non-linear ones, as identified in the reflection.
    Minimizing wastage is achieved by maximizing its negative value.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # bins that cannot fit the item will never be chosen, as their
    # priority will remain at this extremely low value.

    # For the bins that can fit the item, calculate the "wastage" or
    # the remaining space after the item is placed. The Best Fit strategy
    # seeks to minimize this wastage.
    # To transform this into a priority score where higher is better,
    # we take the negative of the wastage. This represents a linear
    # mapping where a smaller positive wastage (cost) results in a
    # larger (less negative) priority score.
