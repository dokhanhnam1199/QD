- **Keywords:** feasibility, capacity‑aware, tie‑breaking, documentation, deterministic, modular  
- **Advice:** build modular components, test on synthetic data, use deterministic tie‑breakers, validate against known optima, log decisions, iterate systematically  
- **Avoid:** arbitrary random seeds, hard‑coded weights, ignoring edge cases, overfitting, undocumented heuristics  
- **Explanation:** these guidelines reduce bias, improve reproducibility, enhance maintainability, and support continuous improvement.
