**Analysis:**

- **Best (1st) vs Worst (20th)**  
  The best heuristic uses a concise, deterministic scheme: inverse leftover priority, a tiny index bias, and a small reproducible jitter scaled by the item size. Its docstring clearly outlines these components. The worst heuristic adds redundant assignments (`base = 0.0` before re‑assignment), a non‑deterministic RNG (no seed), and a load‑scaled jitter term, increasing computational overhead without clear benefit. The complexity can slow execution and obscure reproducibility.

- **Second Best (2nd) vs Second Worst (19th)**  
  The second best is identical to the best, offering the same deterministic, lightweight priority computation. The second worst incorporates an additional mean‑centered load term and uses `rng = np.random.default_rng()` without seeding. Its bias term (`bias = idx[feasible] * 1e-6`) is added then subtracted, making its effect unclear. The extra arithmetic and the non‑deterministic jitter add noise and potential instability.

- **1st vs 2nd**  
  These two functions are identical; no difference exists. Both are simple, deterministic, and efficient.

- **3rd vs 4th**  
  The third and fourth heuristics are also identical. They introduce sinusoidal jitter (`np.sin((item + np.arange(n)) * 0.01)`) and a random jitter term. While deterministic in scale, the additional trigonometric computation and jitter add marginal overhead with no demonstrated performance gain.

- **Second Worst (19th) vs Worst (20th)**  
  The 19th heuristic adds a mean‑centered load term to bias toward bins closer to the mean remaining capacity, while the 20th focuses on a load‑scaled random jitter. Both lack deterministic seeding, making runs non‑reproducible. The 20th contains a redundant base assignment and uses a somewhat arbitrary load scaling factor, increasing code complexity.

**Overall:**  
The top heuristic stands out for its minimalism, deterministic behavior, and efficient vectorized operations. The lower‑ranked heuristics introduce unnecessary complexity, non‑deterministic jitter, and redundant calculations, which can degrade performance and reproducibility. Effective design should prioritize simplicity, clear docstrings, and deterministic tie‑breaking.

**Experience:**  
Simple, deterministic priorities work best. Keep computations vectorized, avoid per‑call RNG seeding, limit jitter, use inverse leftover + small index bias, add variance or load balancing only if justified. Remove redundant assignments and mean‑center bias unless proven. This yields fast, reproducible, robust bin‑packing decisions.
