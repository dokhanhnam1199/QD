- **Keywords** – adaptive jitter, feasibility filter, multi‑score, stochastic tie‑breaker, capacity awareness.  
- **Advice** – use a primary inverse‑leftover score, augment with variance‑scaled random jitter proportional to item size and current bin load, and a secondary load‑balancing term; sample a small set of top candidates stochastically before deterministic fallback.  
- **Avoid** – fixed RNG seeds, sole index bias, only deterministic tie‑breakers, static jitter magnitude, hard‑coded penalties, over‑engineered deterministic perturbations.  
- **Explanation** – adaptive randomness improves exploration across instances while preserving speed; multi‑criteria scoring balances feasibility and load, and safeguards against pathological ties without sacrificing reproducibility.
