{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize reproducibility: use fixed RNG seeds, simple index bias, and minimal jitter; avoid unnecessary imports and random exploration unless proven beneficial. Keep the heuristic concise and deterministic to ensure consistent performance.\nDesign heuristics that prioritize feasibility (`\u2011inf` for invalid bins), use capacity\u2011aware scores (inverse leftover), add tiny random tie\u2011breakers for robustness, and document intent clearly. Avoid worst\u2011fit bias and ensure type hints match actual returns.\n\nPrioritize minimal, vectorized operations, clear docstrings, reproducible random tie\u2011breaking, noise proportional to item size, and early returns for empty inputs; avoid duplicate imports and incomplete logic to build robust, high\u2011performance heuristics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
