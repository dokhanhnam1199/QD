Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n# deterministic RNG for reproducible jitter\n_rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n\n    \"\"\"Score bins: inverse leftover, tiny index bias, and scaled random jitter.\"\"\"\n    n = bins_remain_cap.size\n    if n == 0:\n        return np.empty(0, dtype=float)\n    eps = 1e-9\n    remaining = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible = remaining >= 0\n    priority = np.full(n, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    priority[feasible] = 1.0 / (remaining[feasible] + eps)\n    # deterministic tie\u2011breaker: prefer lower index\n    priority[feasible] += -np.arange(n)[feasible] * 1e-5\n    # tiny reproducible jitter proportional to item size\n    jitter = _rng.random(n) * 0.01 * item\n    priority[feasible] += jitter[feasible]\n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** capacity\u2011aware, adaptive stochastic tie\u2011breakers, dynamic jitter, vectorized scoring.  \n- **Advice:** use inverse\u2011leftover as primary score, add jitter proportional to item size, layer a deterministic tie\u2011breaker for reproducibility, and include early\u2011exit checks with fully vectorized operations.  \n- **Avoid:** fixed RNG seeds, static index bias, constant tiny jitter, unused imports, over\u2011parameterization, dead\u2011code, and any logic that remains deterministic\u2011only.  \n- **Explanation:** adaptive jitter balances exploration with item scale, stochastic tie\u2011breakers prevent systematic bias, deterministic fallbacks keep runs reproducible, and vectorized logic ensures high performance.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
