**Analysis:**  
Comparing the best (Heuristics 1) vs the worst (Heuristics 20), we see the best uses a module‑level seeded RNG for reproducible jitter, a tiny negative index bias, and simple inverse‑leftover scoring; the worst creates a fresh RNG each call, mixes deterministic golden‑ratio jitter with adaptive random jitter that depends on the current max capacity, and lacks a fixed seed, making its ordering noisy and non‑deterministic.  
Comparing the second best (Heuristics 2) vs the second worst (Heuristics 19), the pair mirrors the previous comparison – identical deterministic design versus a version that adds the same golden‑ratio jitter and adaptive random term, again sacrificing reproducibility and adding unnecessary scaling.  
Comparing the third best (Heuristics 3) vs the third worst (Heuristics 18), the third best adds a sinusoidal deterministic jitter of order 1e‑9 and keeps the same index bias; the third worst drops the index bias, uses a standard‑normal jitter (larger variance) and only a tiny deterministic term proportional to remaining capacity, reducing control over tie‑breaking.  
Comparing the fourth best (Heuristics 4) vs the fourth worst (Heuristics 17), the fourth best piles multiple deterministic components (golden‑ratio, sinusoidal) on top of a fresh random jitter each call; the fourth worst uses only a Gaussian jitter and a minuscule deterministic term, but lacks any index bias, making bin selection essentially random.  
Comparing the fifth best (Heuristics 5) vs the fifth worst (Heuristics 16), the fifth best combines a deterministic golden‑ratio jitter with a modest uniform random jitter, while the fifth worst is essentially a stub that returns an empty array after a size check – it never scores any bin.  
Comparing the sixth best (Heuristics 6) vs the sixth worst (Heuristics 15), the sixth best keeps a clean inverse‑leftover score, a modest index bias, deterministic golden‑ratio jitter and a simple uniform random jitter; the sixth worst introduces many hyper‑parameters (adaptive jitter based on leftover ratio, deterministic modular jitter, optional seed) that increase complexity without clear benefit.  
Comparing the seventh best (Heuristics 7) vs the seventh worst (Heuristics 14), the seventh best repeats the clean pattern of 6; the seventh worst adds deterministic sinusoidal jitter and a pseudo‑random LCG‑style jitter, both of which are deterministic but introduce extra computation and tie‑break noise.  
Comparing the eighth best (Heuristics 8) vs the eighth worst (Heuristics 13), identical to the previous pair – the best stays minimal, the worst layers golden‑ratio, sinusoidal, and pseudo‑random jitter, making the score harder to predict.  
Comparing the ninth best (Heuristics 9) vs the ninth worst (Heuristics 12), both are deterministic (no RNG) and use inverse‑leftover, a negative index bias, golden‑ratio jitter and a sinusoidal “pseudo‑random” term; however the ninth worst repeats the same code but is placed lower, suggesting that the ranking penalizes the lack of any random component for robustness.  
Comparing the tenth best (Heuristics 10) vs the tenth worst (Heuristics 11), the tenth best employs deterministic sinusoidal jitter and a linear‑congruential pseudo‑random jitter, preserving reproducibility; the tenth worst adds a temperature‑scaled Gumbel term, a global item counter, and true random jitter, greatly increasing algorithmic complexity and making performance sensitive to parameter decay.  
Comparing adjacent ranks (1st vs 2nd), they are identical, indicating the ranking likely reflects external benchmarking rather than code differences. (3rd vs 4th) the third adds a tiny sinusoidal jitter while the fourth introduces multiple deterministic jitter sources and a fresh RNG, making it noisier. (Second worst vs worst) the second worst still uses the golden‑ratio jitter and adaptive random jitter, whereas the worst adds the same components but also a fresh RNG and scaling by max capacity, increasing stochasticity.  
Overall: the highest‑ranked heuristics prioritize simplicity, deterministic tie‑breakers, a fixed seed for jitter, and a clear inverse‑leftover primary metric; lower‑ranked heuristics layer many jitter mechanisms, use per‑call RNGs, or omit essential feasibility handling, which leads to unpredictable ordering and higher computational overhead.  

**Experience:**  
Prefer a single, well‑scaled primary score (inverse leftover), a tiny deterministic index bias, and reproducible jitter from a fixed RNG; avoid per‑call RNG creation, excessive deterministic jitter terms, and unnecessary hyper‑parameters. Ensure robust handling of empty or infeasible bins.
