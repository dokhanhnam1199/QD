Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n# deterministic RNG for reproducible jitter\n_rng = np.random.default_rng(42)\n\n    \"\"\"Score bins: inverse leftover, tiny index bias, and scaled random jitter.\"\"\"\n    n = bins_remain_cap.size\n    if n == 0:\n        return np.empty(0, dtype=float)\n    eps = 1e-9\n    remaining = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible = remaining >= 0\n    priority = np.full(n, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    priority[feasible] = 1.0 / (remaining[feasible] + eps)\n    # deterministic tie\u2011breaker: prefer lower index\n    priority[feasible] += -np.arange(n)[feasible] * 1e-5\n    # tiny reproducible jitter proportional to item size\n    jitter = _rng.random(n) * 0.01 * item\n    priority[feasible] += jitter[feasible]\n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords**: reproducibility, deterministic, capacity\u2011aware, vectorized, tie\u2011breaker.  \n- **Advice**: set fixed RNG seeds, compute scores as inverse leftover capacity, add tiny jitter proportional to item size, use NumPy vectorization, early\u2011return on empty input.  \n- **Avoid**: unnecessary random exploration, extra imports, worst\u2011fit bias, vague type hints, non\u2011deterministic branches.  \n- **Explanation**: Determinism ensures consistent evaluation; capacity\u2011aware scores prioritize feasible bins; minimal jitter resolves ties without disrupting performance; vectorization yields speed.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
