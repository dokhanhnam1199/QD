**Analysis:**

Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see the best implementation uses a clear docstring, vectorized `np.where`, a well‑chosen epsilon, noise proportional to the item size, and an early return for empty inputs; the worst lacks a return, imports unused libraries, and has no noise scaling or error handling.  
(Second best) vs (Second worst) – the second best adds a deterministic tie‑breaker and handles infeasible bins gracefully, whereas the second worst again contains extraneous imports and an incomplete body.  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st is simpler and cleaner but lacks the deterministic index bias of the 2nd, which can improve consistency during ties.  
(3rd) vs (4th) – both use inverse leftover scoring, but the 3rd employs a `default_rng` and tiny noise, while the 4th simply adds a fixed jitter; the difference is minor but the 3rd offers reproducibility.  
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both are incomplete: the second worst has unused imports and a custom epsilon but no core logic, while the worst has no return statement at all.  
Overall: the top heuristics excel in concise, vectorized code, clear tie‑breaking, proper noise scaling, and robust edge‑case handling; the bottom ones suffer from clutter, missing logic, and lack of reproducibility.

**Experience:**

Prioritize minimal, vectorized operations, clear docstrings, reproducible random tie‑breaking, noise proportional to item size, and early returns for empty inputs; avoid duplicate imports and incomplete logic to build robust, high‑performance heuristics.
