- **Keywords:** capacity‑aware, adaptive stochastic tie‑breakers, dynamic jitter, vectorized scoring.  
- **Advice:** use inverse‑leftover as primary score, add jitter proportional to item size, layer a deterministic tie‑breaker for reproducibility, and include early‑exit checks with fully vectorized operations.  
- **Avoid:** fixed RNG seeds, static index bias, constant tiny jitter, unused imports, over‑parameterization, dead‑code, and any logic that remains deterministic‑only.  
- **Explanation:** adaptive jitter balances exploration with item scale, stochastic tie‑breakers prevent systematic bias, deterministic fallbacks keep runs reproducible, and vectorized logic ensures high performance.
