Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Inverse leftover capacity with tiny random tie\u2011breakers; infeasible bins get -inf.\"\"\"\n    if bins_remain_cap.size == 0:\n        return np.empty_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    residual = bins_remain_cap - item\n    eps = 1e-6\n    noise = np.random.rand(bins_remain_cap.size) * 0.01 * item\n    return np.where(residual >= 0, 1.0 / (residual + eps) + noise, -np.inf)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** feasibility, capacity\u2011aware, tie\u2011breaking, documentation, deterministic, modular  \n- **Advice:** build modular components, test on synthetic data, use deterministic tie\u2011breakers, validate against known optima, log decisions, iterate systematically  \n- **Avoid:** arbitrary random seeds, hard\u2011coded weights, ignoring edge cases, overfitting, undocumented heuristics  \n- **Explanation:** these guidelines reduce bias, improve reproducibility, enhance maintainability, and support continuous improvement.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
