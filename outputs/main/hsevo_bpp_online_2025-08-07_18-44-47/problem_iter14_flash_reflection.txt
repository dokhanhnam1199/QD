**Analysis:**  
- **Comparing (best) vs (worst):** The best heuristic (1st) returns a full priority vector using inverse leftover, a negative index bias, a reproducible random jitter, and an ultra‑small deterministic jitter, giving reproducible yet diversified tie‑breaking. The worst heuristic (20th) stops after size‑check and returns an empty array, providing no scoring at all.  
- **Comparing (second best) vs (second worst):** The second best (2nd) still computes a well‑defined priority with inverse leftover, index bias, and reproducible jitter. The second worst (19th) defines many hyper‑parameters but never computes any priority, leaving the function effectively non‑functional.  
- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** The only difference is the extra deterministic jitter term in (1st), which supplies a stable, deterministic tie‑breaker without altering the main score, making (1st) marginally more robust.  
- **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** (3rd) duplicates the top heuristic (identical to 1st). (4th) replaces the deterministic jitter with a sinusoidal term and reduces the index‑bias magnitude; the sinusoid adds negligible influence, yielding a slightly weaker tie‑break.  
- **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst):** Heuristics (19th) and (20th) are essentially identical stubs that lack any priority computation; (19th) merely has a richer docstring, but both are equally ineffective.  
- **Overall:** The ranking follows a clear gradient: heuristics that combine a solid primary score (inverse leftover) with deterministic tie‑breakers and bounded random jitter perform best, while those that omit the primary score or leave core logic unfinished perform worst.  

**Experience:** Use a clear primary objective (e.g., inverse leftover), add deterministic tie‑breakers (index bias, tiny deterministic jitter) for reproducibility, and include a small bounded random jitter for exploration. Avoid over‑parameterization without clear impact, and never leave core logic missing.
