Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The worst heuristic (20th) stops after size\u2011check and returns an empty array, providing no scoring at all.  \n- **Comparing (second best) vs (second worst):** The second best (2nd) still computes a well\u2011defined priority with inverse leftover, index bias, and reproducible jitter. The second worst (19th) defines many hyper\u2011parameters but never computes any priority, leaving the function effectively non\u2011functional.  \n- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** The only difference is the extra deterministic jitter term in (1st), which supplies a stable, deterministic tie\u2011breaker without altering the main score, making (1st) marginally more robust.  \n- **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** (3rd) duplicates the top heuristic (identical to 1st). (4th) replaces the deterministic jitter with a sinusoidal term and reduces the index\u2011bias magnitude; the sinusoid adds negligible influence, yielding a slightly weaker tie\u2011break.  \n- **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst):** Heuristics (19th) and (20th) are essentially identical stubs that lack any priority computation; (19th) merely has a richer docstring, but both are equally ineffective.  \n- **Overall:** The ranking follows a clear gradient: heuristics that combine a solid primary score (inverse leftover) with deterministic tie\u2011breakers and bounded random jitter perform best, while those that omit the primary score or leave core logic unfinished perform worst.\n- \n- **Keywords:** capacity\u2011aware, adaptive stochastic tie\u2011breakers, dynamic jitter, vectorized scoring.  \n- **Advice:** use inverse\u2011leftover as primary score, add jitter proportional to item size, layer a deterministic tie\u2011breaker for reproducibility, and include early\u2011exit checks with fully vectorized operations.  \n- **Avoid:** fixed RNG seeds, static index bias, constant tiny jitter, unused imports, over\u2011parameterization, dead\u2011code, and any logic that remains deterministic\u2011only.  \n- **Explanation:** adaptive jitter balances exploration with item scale, stochastic tie\u2011breakers prevent systematic bias, deterministic fallbacks keep runs reproducible, and vectorized logic ensures high performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
