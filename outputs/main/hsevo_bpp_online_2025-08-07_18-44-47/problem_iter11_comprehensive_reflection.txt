- **Keywords** – Adaptive stochasticity, dynamic weighting, iterative refinement, feature‑rich candidate space.  
- **Advice** – Employ a multi‑arm bandit for bin selection, calibrate jitter on residual capacity, allow controlled randomness, integrate heuristic history, use vectorized operations.  
- **Avoid** – Fixed RNG seeds, minimal jitter, over‑simplified heuristics, limiting exploration without empirical evidence, strictly deterministic logic.  
- **Explanation** – Dynamic randomness explores the space, calibrated jitter reduces bias, feedback loops accelerate convergence, a richer candidate set improves feasibility, vectorization keeps performance high.
