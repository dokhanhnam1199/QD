**Analysis:**  
- **Best (1st) vs. Worst (20th)** – The 1st heuristic’s docstring accurately describes its scoring: “inverse leftover, deterministic index bias, and jitter.” It implements this with a seeded RNG, an ε‑guarded inverse‑leftover term, a negative index bias (‑1e‑5), a tiny positive offset (‑idx·1e‑12) for tie‑breaks, and reproducible jitter (0.01·item). It also handles empty inputs gracefully. The 20th heuristic, despite a similar docstring, contains no implementation beyond a size check, returning an empty array; it provides no scoring, no tie‑break, and no jitter, rendering it non‑functional.

- **2nd vs. 2nd‑worst (19th)** – The 2nd heuristic mirrors the 1st but omits the tiny positive offset (‑idx·1e‑12). It still follows the docstring, uses the same seeded jitter, and respects feasibility. The 19th heuristic defines many parameters and a detailed docstring but never computes a priority; it exits after the size check, making it effectively “dead code.”  

- **1st vs. 2nd** – Both use the same core formula (1/(remaining+ε)) and identical jitter. The only difference lies in the extra positive offset in the 1st (`+ idx·1e‑12`). This micro‑offset can resolve rare ties where the index bias alone is insufficient, offering a marginally more deterministic ordering without affecting performance.

- **3rd vs. 4th** – These two are essentially duplicates of the 1st. Their docstrings and comments match, and the code performs the same inverse‑leftover calculation, identical index bias, and jitter. Variable naming differs (`idx` vs. direct `np.arange`), but the functional behavior and deterministic properties are the same, illustrating redundancy rather than improvement.

- **2nd‑worst (19th) vs. Worst (20th)** – Both are stubs. The 19th includes a richer signature and explanatory docstring, yet after the size guard it returns an empty array, providing no priority values. The 20th is even more minimal but equally non‑functional. Neither contributes to bin‑selection decisions, making them equally ineffective.

- **Overall** – The top‑ranked heuristics consistently: clear docstrings that match the implementation, a primary inverse‑leftover score favoring tight fits, a deterministic low‑index bias for reproducible tie‑breaking, a tiny reproducible jitter scaled by item size, proper handling of empty inputs, and avoidance of unnecessary imports. Lower‑ranked versions either drop essential components (e.g., inverse scoring, jitter), introduce dead code, or add superfluous complexity, leading to poorer or undefined behavior.

**Experience:**  
Use an inverse‑leftover primary score, add a deterministic low‑index bias, and a tiny reproducible jitter scaled to the item size; guard division with a small ε, handle empty inputs, and keep the code simple and deterministic, avoiding unused imports or dead‑code paths.
