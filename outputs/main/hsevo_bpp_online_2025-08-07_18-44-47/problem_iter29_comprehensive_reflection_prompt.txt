{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nKeep heuristics simple: prioritize inverse leftover, add modest variance\u2011scaled jitter, and use a tiny deterministic bias. Avoid heavy state, aggressive penalties, or over\u2011parameterisation that destabilise performance.\nDesign heuristics that prioritize feasibility (`\u2011inf` for invalid bins), use capacity\u2011aware scores (inverse leftover), add tiny random tie\u2011breakers for robustness, and document intent clearly. Avoid worst\u2011fit bias and ensure type hints match actual returns.\n\nPrioritize minimal, vectorized operations, clear docstrings, reproducible random tie\u2011breaking, noise proportional to item size, and early returns for empty inputs; avoid duplicate imports and incomplete logic to build robust, high\u2011performance heuristics.\n\nWhen crafting a bin\u2011selection heuristic, focus on feasibility filtering, variance\u2011based weighting of deterministic vs random jitter, jitter scaling tied to item size and load, a minimal deterministic bias for reproducibility, and numerical safeguards. This combination yields the most robust and efficient heuristics across varied problem instances.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize reproducibility: use fixed RNG seeds, simple index bias, and minimal jitter; avoid unnecessary imports and random exploration unless proven beneficial. Keep the heuristic concise and deterministic to ensure consistent performance.\n\nUse an inverse\u2011leftover primary score, add a deterministic low\u2011index bias, and a tiny reproducible jitter scaled to the item size; guard division with a small \u03b5, handle empty inputs, and keep the code simple and deterministic, avoiding unused imports or dead\u2011code paths.\n\nUse a clear primary objective (e.g., inverse leftover), add deterministic tie\u2011breakers (index bias, tiny deterministic jitter) for reproducibility, and include a small bounded random jitter for exploration. Avoid over\u2011parameterization without clear impact, and never leave core logic missing.\n\nPrefer a single, well\u2011scaled primary score (inverse leftover), a tiny deterministic index bias, and reproducible jitter from a fixed RNG; avoid per\u2011call RNG creation, excessive deterministic jitter terms, and unnecessary hyper\u2011parameters. Ensure robust handling of empty or infeasible bins.\n\nSimple, deterministic priorities work best. Keep computations vectorized, avoid per\u2011call RNG seeding, limit jitter, use inverse leftover + small index bias, add variance or load balancing only if justified. Remove redundant assignments and mean\u2011center bias unless proven. This yields fast, reproducible, robust bin\u2011packing decisions.\n\nKeep heuristics simple\u2014focus on a strong core metric (inverse leftover), use only tiny, variance\u2011scaled jitter for tie\u2011breaking, and avoid over\u2011engineered deterministic perturbations or heavy penalties. This yields robust, fast, and high\u2011quality solutions.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
