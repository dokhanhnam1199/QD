**Analysis:**  
Comparing the 1st vs 20th, the top heuristic uses a variance‑based weight for adaptive jitter, scales random perturbations by item size, and adds a tiny index bias, whereas the bottom one relies on fixed sinusoidal/phi jitter and load‑aware randomness without variance scaling, leading to excessive randomness and poorer feasibility handling.  
The 2nd vs 19th pair shows a similar trend: the 2nd again uses std/mean for jitter weighting, while the 19th’s load‑factor weighting can dampen exploration when load is low, reducing robustness.  
In the 3rd vs 18th comparison, the 3rd employs a deterministic RNG with reproducible jitter and a simple index bias, whereas the 18th adds a variance penalty and normal jitter but offers weaker bias and over‑penalizes moderate leftovers.  
For the 4th vs 17th pair, the 4th repeats the adaptive scheme of the 1st with a fresh RNG each call, balancing exploration; the 17th reverts to the deterministic jitter of the 3rd, lacking adaptive scaling and thus under‑exploring heterogeneous loads.  
The 5th vs 16th and 6th vs 15th pairs are identical to the 3rd, showing that deterministic jitter alone does not match the adaptive strategy.  
The 7th vs 14th pair illustrates that blending deterministic phi jitter with normal jitter scaled by load (7th) outperforms the 14th’s variance penalty and sine jitter, as the former adapts better to load distribution.  
Comparing 8th vs 13th, 8th mirrors 7th’s approach while 13th uses mean‑tracking item averages and CV‑based noise; the latter can be more robust but incurs higher computational cost.  
In the 9th vs 12th pair, 9th mixes sine, phi, and random jitter weighted by load, whereas 12th employs adaptive noise based on global mean and CV; the former is simpler but may mis‑rank under skewed loads.  
Finally, the 10th vs 11th comparison shows that 11th’s variance‑scaled weighting strategy is a balanced compromise similar to the 1st, whereas the 10th duplicates 9th’s simpler scheme.  
Overall, the top heuristics excel by: (1) filtering feasible bins early, (2) weighting deterministic and random components by the variance of remaining capacities, (3) scaling jitter to item size and load distribution, (4) providing deterministic tie‑breakers, and (5) guarding against division by zero with an epsilon.

**Experience:**  
When crafting a bin‑selection heuristic, focus on feasibility filtering, variance‑based weighting of deterministic vs random jitter, jitter scaling tied to item size and load, a minimal deterministic bias for reproducibility, and numerical safeguards. This combination yields the most robust and efficient heuristics across varied problem instances.
