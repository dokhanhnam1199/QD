- **Keywords**: reproducibility, deterministic, capacity‑aware, vectorized, tie‑breaker.  
- **Advice**: set fixed RNG seeds, compute scores as inverse leftover capacity, add tiny jitter proportional to item size, use NumPy vectorization, early‑return on empty input.  
- **Avoid**: unnecessary random exploration, extra imports, worst‑fit bias, vague type hints, non‑deterministic branches.  
- **Explanation**: Determinism ensures consistent evaluation; capacity‑aware scores prioritize feasible bins; minimal jitter resolves ties without disrupting performance; vectorization yields speed.
