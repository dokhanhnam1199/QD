- **Keywords**: feasibility, adaptive jitter, load‑aware scoring, vectorized, stochastic exploration.  
- **Advice**: Use capacity‑aware scores with adaptive random perturbations scaled to item size and bin load; add feasibility penalties and dynamic tie‑breakers; keep implementation vectorized and clearly documented.  
- **Avoid**: Fixed RNG seeds, deterministic index bias, static jitter, sole reliance on inverse‑leftover, redundant imports, dead‑code paths.  
- **Explanation**: Adaptive stochastic components boost exploration while preserving reproducibility; feasibility filters enforce correctness; vectorization ensures speed; removing deterministic shortcuts prevents systematic bias.
