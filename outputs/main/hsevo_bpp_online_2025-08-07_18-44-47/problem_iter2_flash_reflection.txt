**Analysis:**  
- **#1 vs #20** – The top heuristic uses an *inverse‑remaining‑capacity* score (`1/(leftover+ε)`) and returns `‑inf` for infeasible bins, guaranteeing that only bins that can hold the item are considered and that the bin left almost full‑filled is chosen. The worst heuristic (#20) is a pure *worst‑fit* (`bins_remain_cap`), favoring the most empty bin, which is antagonistic to bin‑packing objectives and lacks any documentation.  

- **#2 vs #19** – #2 computes `‑residual` (negative leftover), a linear version of #1 that still respects feasibility via `‑inf`. #19 also uses `‑residual` deterministically but falls back to a random score with probability `ε`. While the random fallback adds exploration, the deterministic part is identical; however, #19’s random branch can select any feasible bin, diluting the quality of the placement.  

- **#3 vs #18** – #3 builds on #2 by adding a small random perturbation (`rand*0.1*item`) to break ties, preserving the deterministic ordering while injecting controlled stochasticity. #18 squares the bin capacity (`bins_remain_cap**2`) for feasible bins, an extreme *worst‑fit* variant that heavily biases toward the largest bins, worsening packing efficiency.  

- **#4 vs #17** – #4 mirrors #2 but adds a guard for empty input arrays, demonstrating defensive programming. #17 is another *worst‑fit* approach (`bins_remain_cap`), lacking any tie‑breaker or feasibility safety beyond `‑inf`.  

- **#5 vs #16** – #5 returns `1/(residual+ε)` for feasible bins but `0` for infeasible ones; `0` can be higher than `‑inf`, risking selection of an impossible bin. #16 correctly uses `‑inf` for infeasible bins and generates a pure random priority for feasible bins, which is safe but lacks deterministic guidance.  

- **#6 vs #12** – #6’s type hint (`-> np.inf`) is outright wrong and misleading, though the implementation matches #2. #12 implements a classic *first‑fit* by using negative indices (`‑idx`) as priorities; it is deterministic and simple but ignores how tightly the item fits, making it less effective than capacity‑aware scores.  

- **#7 vs #9** – #7 mixes deterministic waste (`‑waste`) with random noise weighted by `ε=0.1`. #9 (and duplicate #10) adopt an ε‑greedy scheme: with probability `ε` choose a random feasible bin, otherwise use deterministic waste. Both inject exploration, but #7’s continuous blend is smoother than #9’s abrupt switch.  

- **#8 vs #1** – #8 is essentially a copy of #1 with a more elaborate docstring; both achieve the same optimal *almost‑full‑fit* behavior.  

- **Duplicates (#9/10, #13/14/15)** – Repeating the same random‑only heuristic (no deterministic component) demonstrates diminishing returns; they occupy lower ranks despite being functionally identical.  

- **General observations** – The highest‑ranked functions provide clear docstrings, proper edge‑case handling, deterministic capacity‑aware scoring, and only minimal, well‑controlled randomness. Lower‑ranked ones suffer from missing documentation, incorrect type hints, unsafe fallback values (`0` instead of `‑inf`), or strategies that deliberately pick the least‑filled bins.  

**Experience:**  
Design heuristics that prioritize feasibility (`‑inf` for invalid bins), use capacity‑aware scores (inverse leftover), add tiny random tie‑breakers for robustness, and document intent clearly. Avoid worst‑fit bias and ensure type hints match actual returns.
