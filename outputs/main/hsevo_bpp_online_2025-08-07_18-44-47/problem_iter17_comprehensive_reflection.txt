- **Keywords**: adaptive randomness, multi‑objective score, dynamic jitter, auto‑tuned hyper‑parameters.  
- **Advice**: use a fresh RNG per call with jitter scaled to bin load, combine inverse‑leftover with utilization variance and future capacity forecasts, and employ learning‑based tie‑breakers instead of fixed index bias.  
- **Avoid**: fixed RNG seeds, tiny deterministic jitter, simple low‑index bias, epsilon guards, and an overly minimal deterministic design.  
- **Explanation**: richer exploration reduces systematic bias, improves bin utilization, and retains high performance while staying robust to empty or infeasible bins.
