**Analysis:**  
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic uses a fixed RNG seed, a tiny index bias, and minimal jitter, while the worst imports many unused libraries, adds random exploration, and relies on a different tie‑break direction, making it non‑deterministic and heavier.  
(Second best) vs (second worst) shows the second best is identical to the best, whereas the second worst removes jitter, using only a 1e‑12 index bias, still deterministic but less robust to ties.  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical in implementation and behavior.  
(3rd) vs (4th) are also identical to the first heuristic, confirming consistency across the top.  
Comparing the second worst vs worst, the second worst is deterministic, whereas the worst introduces random scores with a small probability, adding overhead and non‑determinism.  
Overall: deterministic, lightweight implementations with minimal stochastic tie‑breakers outperform more complex, random‑heavy designs.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize reproducibility: use fixed RNG seeds, simple index bias, and minimal jitter; avoid unnecessary imports and random exploration unless proven beneficial. Keep the heuristic concise and deterministic to ensure consistent performance.
