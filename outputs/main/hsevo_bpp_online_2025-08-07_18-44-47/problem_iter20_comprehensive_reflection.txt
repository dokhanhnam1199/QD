- **Keywords:** adaptive scoring, stochastic tie‑breakers, instance‑aware features, feedback‑driven tuning, vectorized exploration.  
- **Advice:** blend a primary capacity‑aware metric with dynamically weighted random perturbations that adapt to bin load distribution; update weights online based on observed packing success; use per‑iteration RNG streams without fixed seeds.  
- **Avoid:** static index bias, fixed deterministic jitter, global seed reuse, hard‑coded hyper‑parameters, neglecting performance feedback.  
- **Explanation:** adaptive randomness and feedback prevent systematic bias, improve solution diversity, and maintain high throughput while still leveraging vectorized operations.
