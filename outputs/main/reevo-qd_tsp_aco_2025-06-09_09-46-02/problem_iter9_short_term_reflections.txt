Adaptive thresholds, geometric mean for degree penalty, localized neighborhood refinement, and dynamic temperature improve performance.

Refine degree penalization with exponential decay, prioritize shortest paths more, and reduce noise impact.

Adaptive degree thresholds (2nd smallest distance), increased sparsification, and local neighborhood refinement improve heuristic quality.

Incorporate node degree, shortest paths, adaptive sparsification, and noise injection for exploration-exploitation balance.

Consider node degree, shortest paths, sparsification, and adaptive scaling to improve exploration-exploitation balance.

Refine degree penalty with exponential decay and prioritize shorter paths via temperature scaling. Tune sparsification and noise injection adaptively.

Adaptive thresholds, robust statistics (median), geometric means, and dynamic temperature improve heuristic quality.

Local neighborhood refinement, geometric mean for degree penalty, and edge clustering improve heuristic quality.

Local neighborhood refinement, geometric mean for degree penalty, and edge clustering improve heuristic performance.

The better heuristic incorporates node degree, shortest path approximation, and sparsification, enhancing exploration and focusing the search.
