def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Heuristic function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) based on stochastic solution sampling.

    This function combines multiple factors to determine the promise of including each edge in a solution.
    It considers:
        1. Inverse distance: Shorter distances are preferred.
        2. Node degree: Edges connected to nodes with fewer connections are favored (encourages exploration).
        3. Global shortest path consideration: An approximation of whether the edge lies on several shortest paths.
        4. Sparsification: Sets less promising edges to zero.
        5. Adaptive thresholding: Dynamically adjusts the sparsification threshold.
        6. Enhanced degree penalty: Considers both in-degree and out-degree for a more balanced exploration.
    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A square matrix representing the distances between cities.
                                         distance_matrix[i][j] is the distance between city i and city j.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A matrix of the same shape as distance_matrix, where each element represents the
                      promise of including the corresponding edge in the TSP solution.
