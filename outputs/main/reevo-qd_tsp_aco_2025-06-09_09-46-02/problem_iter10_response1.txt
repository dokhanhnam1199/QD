def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Heuristic function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) based on stochastic solution sampling with further improvements.

    This function builds upon heuristics_v1 by incorporating more refined adaptive scaling, localized degree calculation,
    and neighborhood refinement to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in TSP solution sampling.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A square matrix representing the distances between cities.
                                         distance_matrix[i][j] is the distance between city i and city j.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A matrix of the same shape as distance_matrix, where each element represents the
                      promise of including the corresponding edge in the TSP solution.
