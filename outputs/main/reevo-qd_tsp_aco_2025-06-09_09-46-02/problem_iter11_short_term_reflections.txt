Adaptive thresholds, localized degree penalties, and edge clustering enhance exploration and solution quality.

Adaptive scaling, localized degree calculation, and neighborhood refinement improve heuristic performance.

Adaptive scaling, localized degree estimation, edge clustering, and noise injection improve exploration and solution quality.

Use geometric mean for degree penalty; refine degree with local neighborhoods, and tune sparsification aggressively.

Adaptive scaling, localized degree calculation, and noise injection improve exploration and solution quality.

Better code:
- Refined degree penalty calculation using geometric mean and local neighborhood.
- Adaptive sparsification and noise.

Distance-based scaling in the better code refines edge prioritization, improving solution quality by emphasizing shorter edges.

Adaptive thresholds, geometric mean for degree penalty, local neighborhood refinement, and distance-based scaling improve heuristics.

Refine degree penalty (exponential decay), shortest path bonus (dynamic temperature), and sparsification (aggressive percentile). Reduce noise adaptively.

Adaptive thresholds, neighborhood refinement, geometric mean, dynamic temperature, and distance-based scaling improve performance.
