Use smooth sigmoid scoring, bias towards tight fits, adapt exploration rate, penalize waste, tune sigmoid steepness dynamically.
Prefer deterministic best‑fit, drop ε‑greedy; assign -inf to infeasible bins; use tiny index tie‑breaker for stability.
Prioritize exact fits, rank others by 1/waste, drop epsilon‑greedy randomness, add tolerance and epsilon for stability.
Prefer bins with minimal leftover; penalize infeasible bins heavily; use inverse leftover or exponential decay.
Use deterministic best‑fit, score by negative leftover, tie‑break via bin index, drop random exploration, set infeasible bins to -inf.
Use deterministic best‑fit with exact‑fit boost; avoid random epsilon‑greedy; pre‑filter infeasible bins; prioritize minimal leftover.
Exclude infeasible bins, score by negative leftover, add tiny tie‑breakers, normalize priorities, consider dynamic scaling.
Deterministic best‑fit with tiny tie‑breaker; keep bins sorted by free space; skip epsilon‑greedy random exploration.
Prefer deterministic fit scores, minimize leftover, include bin count, item size distribution, and adapt epsilon dynamically.
Use smooth capacity‑aware scores; calibrate sigmoid steepness for fit sensitivity; add adaptive exploration and heavy penalty for waste.
