Use fit mask, logistic scaling, penalize low fill, adjust k, weight by item size.
Prefer bins with minimal leftover; check feasibility; use negative leftover ratio; avoid zero‑div; normalize; epsilon tie‑breaker; -inf infeasible.
Deterministic best‑fit, boost exact fits, avoid randomness, simple leftover score, assign -inf to infeasible bins.
Encode fit quality, penalize infeasible bins, apply smooth monotonic scoring, tune sigmoid steepness, prioritize tighter fits.
Use simple deterministic best‑fit, minimal state, cheap tie‑breaker; avoid random exploration and complex penalties.
Prefer deterministic sigmoid scores; normalize fit ratios; penalize large leftovers; avoid random exploration; add adaptive decay.
Merge exact‑fit, best‑fit, adaptive epsilon, and waste penalty weighted by average item size.
Adapt steepness via median leftover; sigmoid fit bias; exponential waste penalty; exact‑fit boost; normalize; tie‑breaker.
Use adaptive sigmoid scores, reward tight fits, heavily penalize infeasible bins, calibrate steepness to residual spread, reduce randomness.
Use adaptive epsilon, feasibility mask, sigmoid scoring, utilization‑aware steepness, waste penalty, and jitter for tie‑breaks.
