- Add exploration.  
- Exact‑fit detection.  
- Prioritize smaller leftover.  
- Boost exact fits.  
- Use random tie‑breaking.
Normalize scores, discard infeasible bins, use deterministic best‑fit ratio, add tiny index tie‑breaker, avoid random exploration.
Use smooth adaptive scoring, calibrate steepness to residual spread, avoid hard thresholds, handle infeasibility, ensure deterministic tie‑breakers.
Scale sigmoid by feasible residual std, reward tight fits, eliminate random jitter, use deterministic tie‑breaker.
Prefer smooth adaptive scoring (e.g., sigmoid), scale by residual spread, avoid hard thresholds, handle zero variance, add deterministic tie‑breaker.
Use adaptive sigmoid scaling, weight by residual ratio, penalize waste, avoid overflow, tie‑break by index, add exploration.
Use smooth, scale‑aware scoring; avoid hard boosts; calibrate steepness to residual distribution; incorporate tie‑breaking bias; handle infeasibility uniformly.
Exact-fit priority, inverse waste scoring, waste penalty vs. average size, decaying epsilon‑greedy, low-index tie‑break.
Scale scores by residual spread, use adaptive sigmoid or softmax, heavily penalize infeasible bins, add deterministic tie bias.
Derive sigmoid slope from current residual spread; avoid global state; clip exponent to prevent overflow; add tiny deterministic bias.
