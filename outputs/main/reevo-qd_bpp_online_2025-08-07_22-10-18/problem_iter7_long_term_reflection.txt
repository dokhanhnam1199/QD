- Score only feasible bins by negative leftover, boost exact fits with a sharp sigmoid tuned to residual spread.  
- Keep tie‑breaking deterministic (index or tiny bias).  
- Add decaying epsilon exploration for long‑term performance.  
- Normalize by capacity, clip exponents to avoid overflow.  
- Penalize waste exponentially, avoid hard thresholds.
