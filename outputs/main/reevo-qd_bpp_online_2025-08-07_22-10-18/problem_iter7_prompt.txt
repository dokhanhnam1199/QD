BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\n- Score only feasible bins by negative leftover, boost exact fits with a sharp sigmoid tuned to residual spread.  \n- Keep tie\u2011breaking deterministic (index or tiny bias).  \n- Add decaying epsilon exploration for long\u2011term performance.  \n- Normalize by capacity, clip exponents to avoid overflow.  \n- Penalize waste exponentially, avoid hard thresholds.\n\n[Code]\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive sigmoid priority for online bin packing.\n\n    Gives higher priority to bins that accommodate the item tightly.\n    The steepness of the sigmoid is calibrated to the spread of feasible\n    residual capacities, ensuring a balanced exploitation of tight fits\n    across different instance scales.
