Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Capacity utilization, fit score, waste decay, robustness, simplicity.
* **Advice:** Prioritize direct "fit" *and* wasteâ€”use exponential decay on waste to subtly penalize bin choices leading to fragmentation *without* overcomplicating the core selection. Tune decay rates carefully.
* **Avoid:** Normalization masking crucial differences; complex functions (sigmoid) when simpler ones suffice; solely relying on remaining capacity without waste consideration.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on speed. While context (bin age, global waste) is valuable, it adds cost. Exponential decay elegantly balances long-term impact (waste) with immediate need (fit) at low computational overhead, ensuring robustness.
