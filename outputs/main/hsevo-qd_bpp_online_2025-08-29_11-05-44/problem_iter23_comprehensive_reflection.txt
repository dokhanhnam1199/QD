Okay, let's distill this into actionable heuristic design guidance, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Weighted scoring, Exponential decay, Robustness, Tunability.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *weighted* combinations of fit, waste, and bin age. Start simple, implement a solid baseline, *then* introduce complexity cautiously. Exponential decay for waste is excellent â€“ tune its rate!
* **Avoid:** Normalization unless *absolutely* necessary (it can hide crucial differences). Overly complex functions (sigmoids) when simpler alternatives (direct fit measures) exist. Division by zero *at all costs*.
* **Explanation:** The core is balancing exploitation (immediate fit) with exploration (minimizing long-term waste). Tunable weights allow adaptation; robustness prevents crashes; simplicity ensures maintainability & speed.
