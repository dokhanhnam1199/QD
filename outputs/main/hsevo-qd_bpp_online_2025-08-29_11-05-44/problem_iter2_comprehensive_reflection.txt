Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Pragmatism, Measurability, Robustness, Signal Clarity.
* **Advice:** Prioritize easily calculated, directly interpretable metrics. Focus on *identifiable bottlenecks* and iteratively improve the heuristic's response to those. Embrace minimal, working code.
* **Avoid:** Abstract, multi-faceted "fitness" scores. Over-engineering for edge cases *before* demonstrating baseline performance. Premature optimization.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics thrive on speed & reliability. Clarity in measuring progress (fit) allows for targeted refinement. Robustness (handling errors) prevents catastrophic failures.
