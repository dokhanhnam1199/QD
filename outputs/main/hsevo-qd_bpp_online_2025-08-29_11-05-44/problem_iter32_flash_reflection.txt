**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the key difference is the waste calculation and its integration. Heuristic 1st uses `np.exp(-0.01 * waste)` decaying the entire system waste, while heuristic 2nd calculates waste as the difference between remaining capacity and item size for *possible* bins, using `1.0 / (1.0 + waste)`. Heuristic 1st also includes an age bonus, a feature missing in 2nd.

Comparing 3rd vs 4th, both combine waste and fit. 3rd uses `np.exp(-waste / item)` for waste decay, scaling by the item size, alongside an inverse waste fit score. 4th uses `np.exp(-0.005 * waste)` with a simpler waste penalty, not scaled by item size. 

Comparing 5th vs 6th, both incorporate waste, fit and age. 5th introduces a strong penalty/boost if waste is zero, and subtracts the log of possible bins, potentially creating instability. 6th uses weighted combination (0.5, 0.3, 0.2) for a more controlled integration.

Comparing 7th vs 8th, both are variations of heuristic 2nd, but 8th introduces weighted combination and a different way to compute waste influence.

Comparing 9th vs 10th, 9th is a refinement of 6th with tuned weights, while 10th is very basic (almost returning zero priority) and implements only a simple inverse waste.

Comparing 11th vs 12th, 11th combines inverse remaining capacity with exponential waste decay, while 12th only implements inverse remaining capacity. 

Comparing 13th vs 14th, 13th introduces a density preference, adding complexity with another weight. 14th is similar to others but uses a global `total_waste` which might be suboptimal.

Comparing 15th vs 16th, 15th is a duplicate of 14th. 16th combines capacity-weighted preference and waste-sensitive decay, but its use of `np.exp(-k * total_waste)` makes it very sensitive to the total waste.

Comparing 17th vs 18th, 17th is extremely basic. 18th prioritizes bins based on remaining capacity and avoids division by zero, but uses unnecessary imports.

Comparing 19th vs 20th, 19th utilizes a sigmoid function to avoid division by zero. 20th uses a combination of fit, waste and age, with optional bin ages.

Overall: The top heuristics (1st-6th, 8th, 9th) all converge on a combination of *fit*, *waste decay*, and optionally *age*. Exponential decay of waste seems to be more effective than simple subtraction or inverse calculations. Weighted combinations of these features appear crucial for performance.  The worst performing heuristics (10th, 17th) are overly simplistic.

**Experience:**

Prioritize combining fit, waste decay (exponential is better), and age with carefully tuned weights. Avoid overly aggressive penalties (like in 5th). Global waste calculations (16th) are likely suboptimal. Simple heuristics are often outperformed by more nuanced, weighted approaches.
