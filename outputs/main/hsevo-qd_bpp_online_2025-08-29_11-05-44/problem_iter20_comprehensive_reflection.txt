Okay, let's refine this self-reflection for superior heuristic design â€“ aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Fit, Waste (decay), Age, Tunable Weights, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize weighted combinations of item-bin *fit* (remaining capacity), exponentially decaying *waste* (bin-specific!), and bin *age*. Tune weights empirically. Simple checks for bin validity are vital.
* **Avoid:** Normalization, complex functions (sigmoid), global waste metrics, hardcoded constants, solely relying on remaining capacity.
* **Explanation:**  Focusing on *local* bin characteristics & tunable interaction between fit/waste/age yields adaptable heuristics. Robustness (no division by zero) prevents crashes, while simplicity maintains efficiency and interpretability.
