{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and direct relevance to the objective (minimizing waste). Avoid global terms or normalization that can introduce unintended consequences.  Inverse of remaining capacity or an exponential decay based on waste are strong starting points. Don't assign the same priority to all possible bins; differentiate them based on their fit.\nSimplicity often trumps complexity in heuristics. Direct measures of \"fit\" (like remaining capacity) are usually more effective than complex, parameterized functions. Defensive programming (avoiding division by zero) is crucial. Normalization can be helpful, but be mindful of obscuring important differences.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
