**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic elegantly balances remaining capacity with waste avoidance using a simple inverse relationship, while the worst simply returns zero priorities. (2nd) vs (19th), shows a move toward incorporating fit scores and waste decay, but (19th)â€™s direct use of remaining capacity is less nuanced.  (3rd) vs (18th), both attempt waste and age consideration, but (3rd) includes age as an additive bonus while (18th) uses a sigmoid function on waste, offering more control. (4th) vs (17th), both feature age. (5th) vs (16th), both feature waste decay. (6th) vs (15th), both use exponential decay to account for waste. (7th) vs (14th), (7th) and (8th) are identical, demonstrating a solid approach of waste normalization and fit score integration, which (14th) lacks. (9th) and (10th) return zero vectors, which is clearly undesirable. (11th) vs (13th), both utilize inverse waste. (12th) is effectively the same as (9th) and (10th). Overall, the superior heuristics prioritize efficient capacity utilization, penalize waste, and sometimes, incorporate a memory of bin usage to encourage diversification. The poorer heuristics either do nothing or rely on overly simplistic methods. The best heuristics generally avoid direct maximization of remaining capacity alone; instead, they integrate concepts like fit and waste to guide the bin selection process.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics for bin packing should balance immediate fit (remaining capacity) with long-term considerations like waste and bin age. Exponential decay on waste is a robust technique. Avoid prioritizing bins *solely* by remaining capacity, and always protect against division by zero. Simpler is often better; over-complication can hinder performance.
