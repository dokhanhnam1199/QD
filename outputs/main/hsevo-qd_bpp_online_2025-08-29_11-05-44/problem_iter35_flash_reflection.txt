**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use capacity-weighted preference with waste decay and age bonus. The 1st incorporates `k` and `total_waste` as parameters offering more control. The 2nd has a hardcoded waste decay (0.01) and adds 1.0 to the best binâ€™s priority, potentially skewing selection.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses `1/(waste+1e-6)` which is prone to instability with very small waste, while the 4th utilizes `exp(-0.005 * waste)` offering a smoother decay.  The 3rd is simpler but potentially less robust.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), both attempt similar weighting schemes. The 5th is simpler, using `1/(1+waste)`, while the 6th has age bonus and parameter `k` on total waste and is more complex. 

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), 7th has simpler decay and lacks tunable weights. 8th's weighted approach (fit, waste, age) with decay_rate offers far more control.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th) & (11th), 9th is simply returning zero priorities. 10th and 11th are identical and are a very basic inverse capacity approach avoiding division by zero.

Comparing (12th) vs (13th), 13th imports `scipy` and `torch` which are unnecessary for this task increasing overhead, and is initialized with `total_waste`. 12th has explicit weighting of fit, waste, and age.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th), 14th uses `1/(fit_scores + 1e-6)` to penalize bad fits. 15th introduces `age_factor` and is more complex.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), 16th is a simplified version, while 17th does nothing meaningful, just returning zero priorities if no bins are suitable.

Comparing (18th) vs (19th), 18th attempts inverse remaining capacity but lacks nuance. 19th is overcomplicated with `max_waste`, `waste_decay` and age_bonus, which seems arbitrary.

Comparing (20th) vs (19th), both are poor. 20th is simply a heuristic 1 with more complex equation, which is not better.

Overall: Effective heuristics balance fit, waste reduction, and potentially bin age. Tunable parameters are crucial for adapting to different data distributions. Simplicity and robustness are highly desirable, avoiding unnecessary complexities and potential instability. The best heuristics (1st, 8th) utilize weighting schemes with parameters for control.



**Experience:**

Prioritize parameterization and smooth decay functions (e.g., exponential) over direct calculations like `1/waste`.  Avoid unnecessary imports or complex logic; simplicity often yields better performance. Consider bin age as a secondary factor to break ties and improve long-term bin utilization.
