Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritizes bins based on remaining capacity, avoiding division by zero.\n    Combines elements of heuristics 1 and 7/8 for efficiency and robustness.\"\"\"\n    n_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priorities = np.zeros(n_bins)\n    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(possible_bins):\n        return priorities\n    waste = bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item\n    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0 / (1.0 + waste)\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for superior heuristic design. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K tip!\n\n* **Keywords:** Pragmatism, Measurability, Robustness, Signal Clarity.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize easily calculated, directly interpretable metrics. Focus on *identifiable bottlenecks* and iteratively improve the heuristic's response to those. Embrace minimal, working code.\n* **Avoid:** Abstract, multi-faceted \"fitness\" scores. Over-engineering for edge cases *before* demonstrating baseline performance. Premature optimization.\n* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics thrive on speed & reliability. Clarity in measuring progress (fit) allows for targeted refinement. Robustness (handling errors) prevents catastrophic failures.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
