**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both combine fit, waste decay, and age, but the 1st introduces tunable weights and applies the exponential decay to the fit score *before* adding the age bonus. The 2nd directly adds the age bonus. This pre-scaling in the 1st likely allows for better control and prevents the age bonus from overshadowing the other factors when waste is high. Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 3rd, the 1st has a more nuanced scoring system, explicitly incorporating both fit and waste, while the 3rd relies solely on inverse waste. Heuristics 4th vs 5th, 4th employs capacity weighting of fit, making the best fit even more attractive, a feature absent in 5th. Comparing Heuristics 6th, 7th (identical) vs 8th, 6th/7th utilize a weighted sum of fit, waste, and age, while 8th provides a basic reciprocal of waste with a small correction. Heuristics 9th vs 10th both use a reciprocal of remaining capacity. 9th uses an exponential waste factor, while 10th doesn't. Heuristics 12th and 13th are identical. Heuristics 14th refines the weighted sum of 12th/13th with a better structure and direct application of weights. 15th, 16th and 17th are mostly empty implementations. 18th and 19th are identical, boosting the best-fit bin but still relatively simple. Heuristics 20th uses a sigmoid function which allows for smoother prioritization. Overall, the best heuristics consistently combine multiple factors (fit, waste, age) with weighted sums and/or exponential decay for more robust and adaptable prioritization, avoiding simple reciprocal calculations or incomplete implementations.  The tunable parameters offer greater control.

**Experience:**

Prioritize weighted combinations of fit, waste, and age, utilizing exponential decay to handle waste effectively.  Tunable weights are crucial for adapting to different problem instances. Avoid overly simplistic approaches like pure reciprocals. A robust baseline implementation is paramount before trying more sophisticated techniques.
