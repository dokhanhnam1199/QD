Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines fit score with waste decay and a small age bonus.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(possible_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    fit_scores = -np.abs(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item)\n    waste = np.sum(bins_remain_cap) - np.sum(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins])\n    age_bonus = np.arange(len(bins_remain_cap))[possible_bins] * 0.001\n\n    preferences = (fit_scores * np.exp(-0.01 * waste)) + age_bonus\n    priorities[possible_bins] = preferences\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords:** Capacity utilization, fit score, waste decay, robustness, simplicity.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize direct \"fit\" *and* waste\u2014use exponential decay on waste to subtly penalize bin choices leading to fragmentation *without* overcomplicating the core selection. Tune decay rates carefully.\n* **Avoid:** Normalization masking crucial differences; complex functions (sigmoid) when simpler ones suffice; solely relying on remaining capacity without waste consideration.\n* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on speed. While context (bin age, global waste) is valuable, it adds cost. Exponential decay elegantly balances long-term impact (waste) with immediate need (fit) at low computational overhead, ensuring robustness.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
