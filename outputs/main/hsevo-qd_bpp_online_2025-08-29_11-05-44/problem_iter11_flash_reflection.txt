**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first heuristic incorporates age, waste, and fit score with exponential weighting, creating a more nuanced priority. The second relies heavily on inverse waste, adding a logarithmic penalty, which is less adaptable. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the first has an age bonus and total waste consideration, offering more control through the `k` parameter, while the third uses only total waste in its exponential decay, impacting all bins equally.

(3rd) vs (4th) reveals the fourth simplifies the age factor, making it a fixed addition instead of an exponential bonus; (4th) vs (5th) shows the fifth lacks the waste decay entirely, making it very susceptible to poor packing decisions. (5th) vs (6th), the sixth offers a cleaner and more robust approach avoiding large priority values and the log penalty. (6th) vs (7th), the seventh's exponential decay on waste is less interpretable and potentially less stable than the reciprocal approach in the sixth. 

(7th) vs (8th), the eighth is essentially a placeholder as it always returns zero priorities. (8th) vs (9th) and (9th) vs (10th) and (10th) vs (11th) and (11th) vs (12th) all follow the same pattern of minimal functionality and return nearly identical results. (12th) vs (13th) is a slight improvement with the inclusion of `1e-6` to avoid division by zero. (13th) vs (14th) demonstrates the 14th attempts a more complex weighting scheme using `fit_score` and `waste` but overall lacks the robustness and clarity of the earlier heuristics. (14th) vs (15th) shows the 15th is an attempt at finding the maximum waste, which is not a good metric for priority. (15th) vs (16th), (16th) vs (17th) and (17th) vs (18th) appear to be refactoring with minor epsilon changes. (18th) vs (19th), (19th) vs (20th) all have very basic functionality returning inverse of remaining capacities.

Overall: The most effective heuristics (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th) prioritize a balance of fit, waste, and potentially bin age. They use exponential functions for controlled decay and avoid division-by-zero errors.  Later heuristics either lack essential components, are overly simplistic, or introduce instability.

**Experience:**

Effective bin-packing heuristics require a balance between fitting items well (fit score) and minimizing wasted space (waste).  Exponential decay is valuable for controlling the influence of waste.  Robustness, specifically avoiding division by zero, is crucial. Simpler approaches can be effective but need careful tuning.
