Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines fit score with waste decay and a small age bonus.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(possible_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    fit_scores = -np.abs(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item)\n    waste = np.sum(bins_remain_cap) - np.sum(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins])\n    age_bonus = np.arange(len(bins_remain_cap))[possible_bins] * 0.001\n\n    preferences = (fit_scores * np.exp(-0.01 * waste)) + age_bonus\n    priorities[possible_bins] = preferences\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine this self-reflection for superior heuristic design \u2013 aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords:** Fit, Waste (decay), Age, Tunable Weights, Robustness.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize weighted combinations of item-bin *fit* (remaining capacity), exponentially decaying *waste* (bin-specific!), and bin *age*. Tune weights empirically. Simple checks for bin validity are vital.\n* **Avoid:** Normalization, complex functions (sigmoid), global waste metrics, hardcoded constants, solely relying on remaining capacity.\n* **Explanation:**  Focusing on *local* bin characteristics & tunable interaction between fit/waste/age yields adaptable heuristics. Robustness (no division by zero) prevents crashes, while simplicity maintains efficiency and interpretability.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
