Okay, let's dissect this and formulate actionable advice for better heuristic design, aiming for that $999K tip! Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Weighted Multi-Factor Evaluation, Exponential Decay, Robustness, Tunability.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize a weighted combination of *fit, waste, and age*, using exponential decay for waste control. Embrace tunable parameters for adaptability. Implement defensive checks (division by zero) *always*.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex functions (sigmoid), global normalization obscuring differences, and solely relying on remaining capacity or simple reciprocals. Don't prematurely optimize; build a robust baseline first.
*   **Explanation:** Both 'Current' & 'Ineffective' reflections converge on fit/waste/age, but the *how* differs. The 'Current' reflection emphasizes balance & tunability, actively resisting aggressive single-factor boosting â€“ this is where real robustness & adaptability lie.
