Okay, let's refine heuristic design based on this self-reflection analysis. Here's a breakdown, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Weighted scoring, Exponential decay, Robustness, Tunable parameters.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *weighted* combinations of fit (remaining capacity), waste (exponential decay!), and bin age. Start with a simple weighted sum, then *iteratively* refine weights based on rigorous testing across diverse problem instances.
* **Avoid:** Global waste calculations & complex functions (sigmoid). Over-simplification *and* over-complication. Hardcoded values – always use tunable parameters.
* **Explanation:** The 'Ineffective' reflections repeatedly advocated for simplicity *without* demonstrably improved results. The ‘Current’ analysis consistently points to nuanced, weighted approaches – a sweet spot between simplistic reciprocals and overly complex formulas – yielding superior performance and adaptability.
