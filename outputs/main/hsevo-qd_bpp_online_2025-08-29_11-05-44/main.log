### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Simplicity often trumps complexity in heuristics. Direct measures of "fit" (like remaining capacity) are usually more effective than complex, parameterized functions. Defensive programming (avoiding division by zero) is crucial. Normalization can be helpful, but be mindful of obscuring important differences.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

Response (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.sum(possible_bins) == 0:
        return priorities
    
    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item + 0.0001)
    
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(possible_bins):
        return priorities
    remaining_capacities = bins_remain_cap[possible_bins]
    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0 / remaining_capacities
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing `priority_v2` in the 1st heuristic to the 20th, the core difference lies in the prioritization strategy. The 1st heuristic's `v2` simply assigns a priority based on the inverse of remaining capacity, avoiding division by zero. The 20th (and many others like it) use exponential functions or sigmoids. While these can create a smoother prioritization, they introduce complexity and a potential for diminishing returns. Specifically, the exponential function in the 19th and 20th can quickly saturate, leading to all valid bins having very similar priorities.

Comparing `priority_v2` in the 2nd and 3rd heuristics, the main distinction is the addition of `1e-6` to the denominator in the 3rd. This is a defensive programming technique preventing division by zero, but introduces a slight bias. The 2nd is cleaner.

`priority_v2` in the 4th and 5th are effectively the same as 2nd and 3rd but different variable names (`waste` instead of directly calculating in the division).

The 6th and 7th/8th introduce identical logic, utilizing `possible_bins` to filter and calculate priorities, and are more efficient than the earlier versions without the filtering.

Heuristics 9th and 10th try a different approach – identifying the *best* bin and boosting its priority. This can be beneficial if a slightly better fit dramatically improves the solution.

Heuristics 12th normalizes the waste, which can be useful if bin capacities vary widely. However, normalization can also obscure true differences in fit.

Heuristic 13th assigns negative priority to invalid bins, this helps bins to not be selected.

Heuristics 14th through 18th rely on sigmoid or exponential functions to provide a smoothed priority, but the function and scaling factor influence performance.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st-8th) prioritize simplicity and directness, calculating a score based on remaining capacity. Later heuristics attempt more sophisticated approaches but often introduce unnecessary complexity or parameters without a clear benefit. The addition of small constants (e.g. `1e-6`) for numerical stability is good practice.

Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Pragmatism, Measurability, Robustness, Signal Clarity.
* **Advice:** Prioritize easily calculated, directly interpretable metrics. Focus on *identifiable bottlenecks* and iteratively improve the heuristic's response to those. Embrace minimal, working code.
* **Avoid:** Abstract, multi-faceted "fitness" scores. Over-engineering for edge cases *before* demonstrating baseline performance. Premature optimization.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics thrive on speed & reliability. Clarity in measuring progress (fit) allows for targeted refinement. Robustness (handling errors) prevents catastrophic failures.


Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.
Output the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Prioritizes bins based on remaining capacity, avoiding division by zero.
    Combines elements of heuristics 1 and 7/8 for efficiency and robustness."""
    n_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities = np.zeros(n_bins)
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(possible_bins):
        return priorities
    waste = bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item
    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0 / (1.0 + waste)
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Pragmatism, Measurability, Robustness, Signal Clarity.
* **Advice:** Prioritize easily calculated, directly interpretable metrics. Focus on *identifiable bottlenecks* and iteratively improve the heuristic's response to those. Embrace minimal, working code.
* **Avoid:** Abstract, multi-faceted "fitness" scores. Over-engineering for edge cases *before* demonstrating baseline performance. Premature optimization.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics thrive on speed & reliability. Clarity in measuring progress (fit) allows for targeted refinement. Robustness (handling errors) prevents catastrophic failures.


Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    waste = bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item
    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0 / (1.0 + waste)
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
