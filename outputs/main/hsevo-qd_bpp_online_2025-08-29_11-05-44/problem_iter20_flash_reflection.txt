**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both are very similar, but the 1st introduces `total_waste` impacting preference through exponential decay, and includes a `bin_ages` bonus. The 2nd is cleaner, integrating age directly into the preference calculation. However, the explicit `total_waste` parameter in the 1st offers potential for tuning waste sensitivity.

Comparing Heuristics 3rd vs 4th, the 3rd uses inverse waste with a log penalty for the number of possible bins, aiming to distribute items. The 4th is simpler, just inverse waste. The log penalty in the 3rd seems like a potential overcorrection and adds complexity.

Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 3rd, the 1st provides a richer feature set (waste decay, age, fit score) with more tunable parameters. The 3rd is much more basic. 

Comparing Heuristics 5th vs 6th, 6th incorporates a check for valid bins which makes it slightly more efficient, but both are basic inverse remaining capacity.

Heuristics 7th is essentially the same as 4th. Heuristics 8th attempts weighting, but the weights are arbitrary. Heuristics 9th is more sophisticated with waste decay but uses total waste instead of waste relative to the current item. Heuristics 10th attempts fill level and waste, but is complicated. Heuristics 11th adds a hardcoded boost to the best fit.  Heuristics 12th & 13th include unnecessary parameters for waste decay, age weight, and constants which suggests overfitting. 14th-20th are progressively worse - simplifying to inverse capacity or using sigmoids, and offer no significant improvements. The last ones are simplistic or less effective. Overall, the best heuristics combine fit, waste/capacity, and age while providing tunable parameters. Simpler approaches with only waste or capacity tend to be less effective, and complex approaches often introduce unnecessary parameters.

**Experience:**

Prioritize heuristics that balance fit, capacity, and age, allowing for tuning of waste sensitivity. Avoid overly complex formulas or hardcoded parameters. Efficiency gains through simple checks (valid bins) are valuable. Focus on parameters directly related to the bin packing problem, and avoid introducing constants without justification.
