**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first heuristic incorporates a tunable waste decay *and* an age bonus, weighting them with the fit score, creating a more nuanced priority. The second relies solely on fit and waste, lacking the age component for potential stagnation. (3rd) vs (4th) shows the 3rd adds a small age bonus and weighted combination which is better than simple fit and waste penalty in the 4th. (5th) vs (6th) reveals the 6th adds an explicit 'best_bin_index' boost, potentially hindering exploration. (7th) vs (8th) demonstrates simplification in 7th, relying on inverse waste. (9th) vs (10th) shows the 9th is a weighted combination of fit, waste, and age bonus. (11th) vs (12th) shows the 11th attempts to boost the best fit, but 12th uses normalized waste. (13th) vs (14th) shows similar implementations, but different weightings. (15th) uses parameters. (16th) calculates total waste. (17th) normalizes temperature which is not good. (18th) and (19th) are incomplete. (20th) is a good combination of fit, waste and age.

Overall: The most successful heuristics (1st, 3rd, 9th, 13th, 14th, 20th) consistently combine fit (how well an item fits in a bin), waste (how much space is left after placing the item), and age (how recently a bin was used).  Tunable parameters and weighted combinations seem crucial for balancing these factors. Simpler approaches (7th, 8th) can be less effective. Explicitly boosting a single bin (6th, 11th) can limit search diversity.

**Experience:**

Prioritize combining fit, waste, and age for robust bin selection. Weighting these components is vital. Consider tunable parameters. Avoid overly aggressive boosting of individual bins.  Exploration is key; a balanced approach generally outperforms simplified or overly-focused heuristics.
