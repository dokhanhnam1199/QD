**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical code, indicating no discernible difference in their performance.  (1st) and (2nd) are strong contenders as they combine fit, waste decay, and age bonus - a well-rounded approach. (1st) vs (3rd): The former incorporates exponential decay for waste, allowing for a tunable sensitivity to overall bin waste, whereas (3rd) uses a simpler exponential based only on the immediate bin's waste, lacking global context. (3rd) vs (4th) & (5th): (3rd) is more concise and likely computationally cheaper, but (4th) and (5th) introduce `bin_ages`, potentially improving solutions over time. (4th) and (5th) are identical.  (6th) vs (7th) & (8th): (6th) and (8th) prioritize inverse waste with a small addition to avoid division by zero. (7th) uses a recent usage boost which isnâ€™t as generally useful as bin age. (6th) vs (8th) are identical. (9th) - (15th): These are generally weaker.  (9th) normalizes waste, but the effect is likely limited. (10th)-(12th) are largely identical and use simple inverse waste. (13th)-(15th) introduce sigmoid functions which can smooth the scoring but introduce computational cost with limited benefit. (16th) - (20th): Similar to the top-ranked heuristics, employing waste decay, fit, and age bonuses but with minor variations in the decay function and weightings. They are complex than (1st) and (2nd) but also have the same features. Overall: The best heuristics (1st/2nd, 16th-20th) effectively balance fit, waste, and age, while simpler heuristics (3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th-12th) lack the nuance for optimal bin packing.

**Experience:**

Prioritize combining multiple factors (fit, waste, age) with tunable weights. Exponential decay for waste offers better control. Simplicity is good, but context (global waste, bin age) improves heuristic effectiveness. Avoid unnecessary computational complexity like sigmoid functions if simpler alternatives suffice.
