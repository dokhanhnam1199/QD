**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the key difference lies in weighting the `fit_scores` by capacity in the 2nd heuristic and adding a further boost to the best bin. This introduces a bias towards larger bins, which may or may not be desirable depending on the application. The exponential waste decay is similar, but the addition of the boost feels ad-hoc and potentially destabilizing. Heuristic 1st is cleaner and more generally applicable.

Comparing 3rd vs 4th, 3rd is a simplified version of 1st, omitting the capacity weighting. Heuristic 4th uses `waste` directly in the exponent, rather than decaying the whole priority, making it sensitive to the absolute waste value. This is likely less stable than the decay approach.  3rd is better as it's closer to the leading heuristic.

Comparing 5th vs 6th, 5th uses `1.0 / (1.0 + waste)` which provides a simple inverse relationship with waste, while 6th incorporates an age penalty which adds complexity and potentially introduces unwanted behavior. 5th appears more robust and directly addresses waste minimization.

Comparing 7th vs 8th, both are complex, weighted schemes. 8th is more structured with defined weights, but it still depends on an age factor that might not be consistently helpful. 7th includes `bin_ages` as an optional argument which adds flexibility, but can cause inconsistency if not used properly. 8th's fixed weights may perform better.

Comparing 9th vs 10th, 9th combines exponential decay with a fit score, while 10th uses a waste factor in addition to a fit score. 9th benefits from a more stable exponential decay approach. 10th's waste factor dependent on the mean can introduce unwanted scaling issues.

Comparing 11th vs 12th, 11th boosts the best-fit bin while 12th uses inverse waste only. Boosting the best-fit can be effective, but may be too aggressive, and is less generalizable than inverse waste.

Comparing 13th vs 14th, 13th is incredibly basic. 14th includes weights and combines fit, waste, and age. 14th is far more sophisticated.

Comparing 15th vs 16th, 15th normalizes waste. 16th is a very complex implementation with various parameters. Normalization is preferable.

Comparing 17th vs 18th, both incorporate boosting best fit. 17th appears more streamlined.

Comparing 19th vs 20th, 19th focuses on the inverse remaining capacity. 20th incorporates age and waste. 19th is simpler and more focused.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 3rd, 5th) prioritize simplicity and directly address fit and waste. Later heuristics introduce unnecessary complexity (weights, age factors) or unstable calculations that likely hinder performance and generalizability. Exponential decay applied to waste is generally more effective than directly using waste values. Boosting the best-fit should be done cautiously.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and stability in heuristic design. Exponential decay for waste is effective. Avoid unnecessary parameters/weights unless demonstrably beneficial. Focus on fit and waste â€“ these are fundamental to bin packing. Start simple and iteratively add complexity only when motivated by clear performance improvements.
