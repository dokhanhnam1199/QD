**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` in the 1st heuristic to the 20th, the core difference lies in the prioritization strategy. The 1st heuristic's `v2` simply assigns a priority based on the inverse of remaining capacity, avoiding division by zero. The 20th (and many others like it) use exponential functions or sigmoids. While these can create a smoother prioritization, they introduce complexity and a potential for diminishing returns. Specifically, the exponential function in the 19th and 20th can quickly saturate, leading to all valid bins having very similar priorities.

Comparing `priority_v2` in the 2nd and 3rd heuristics, the main distinction is the addition of `1e-6` to the denominator in the 3rd. This is a defensive programming technique preventing division by zero, but introduces a slight bias. The 2nd is cleaner.

`priority_v2` in the 4th and 5th are effectively the same as 2nd and 3rd but different variable names (`waste` instead of directly calculating in the division).

The 6th and 7th/8th introduce identical logic, utilizing `possible_bins` to filter and calculate priorities, and are more efficient than the earlier versions without the filtering.

Heuristics 9th and 10th try a different approach â€“ identifying the *best* bin and boosting its priority. This can be beneficial if a slightly better fit dramatically improves the solution.

Heuristics 12th normalizes the waste, which can be useful if bin capacities vary widely. However, normalization can also obscure true differences in fit.

Heuristic 13th assigns negative priority to invalid bins, this helps bins to not be selected.

Heuristics 14th through 18th rely on sigmoid or exponential functions to provide a smoothed priority, but the function and scaling factor influence performance.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st-8th) prioritize simplicity and directness, calculating a score based on remaining capacity. Later heuristics attempt more sophisticated approaches but often introduce unnecessary complexity or parameters without a clear benefit. The addition of small constants (e.g. `1e-6`) for numerical stability is good practice.

**Experience:**

Simplicity often trumps complexity in heuristics. Direct measures of "fit" (like remaining capacity) are usually more effective than complex, parameterized functions. Defensive programming (avoiding division by zero) is crucial. Normalization can be helpful, but be mindful of obscuring important differences.
