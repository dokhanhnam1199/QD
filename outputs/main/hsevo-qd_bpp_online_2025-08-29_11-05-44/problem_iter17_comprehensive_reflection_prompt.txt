{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and a clear signal of *fit*. Avoid unnecessary complexity (like decaying total waste) unless demonstrably beneficial. Focus on maximizing the use of available capacity with minimal waste. The best heuristics balance maximizing capacity utilization and minimizing fragmentation.\nSimplicity often trumps complexity in heuristics. Direct measures of \"fit\" (like remaining capacity) are usually more effective than complex, parameterized functions. Defensive programming (avoiding division by zero) is crucial. Normalization can be helpful, but be mindful of obscuring important differences.\n\nEffective bin-packing heuristics require a balance between fitting items well (fit score) and minimizing wasted space (waste).  Exponential decay is valuable for controlling the influence of waste.  Robustness, specifically avoiding division by zero, is crucial. Simpler approaches can be effective but need careful tuning.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and direct relevance to the objective (minimizing waste). Avoid global terms or normalization that can introduce unintended consequences.  Inverse of remaining capacity or an exponential decay based on waste are strong starting points. Don't assign the same priority to all possible bins; differentiate them based on their fit.\n\nEffective heuristics for bin packing should balance immediate fit (remaining capacity) with long-term considerations like waste and bin age. Exponential decay on waste is a robust technique. Avoid prioritizing bins *solely* by remaining capacity, and always protect against division by zero. Simpler is often better; over-complication can hinder performance.\n\nPrioritize combining multiple factors (fit, waste, age) with tunable weights. Exponential decay for waste offers better control. Simplicity is good, but context (global waste, bin age) improves heuristic effectiveness. Avoid unnecessary computational complexity like sigmoid functions if simpler alternatives suffice.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
