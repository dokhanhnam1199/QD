Okay, let's distill a refined approach to heuristic design, focusing on bin packing as the core example, and aiming for that $999K tip!

**Keywords:** Weighted combination, Exponential decay, Robustness, Tunability.

**Advice:** Prioritize a weighted combination of *fit* (remaining capacity), *waste* (with exponential decay to control influence), and *bin age*. Design for easy parameter tuning of these weights. Focus on clear, direct measures; avoid abstract normalization.

**Avoid:** Complex formulas, global waste calculations, reciprocals, and sigmoid functions unless rigorously proven superior. Overly simplistic solutions or aggressive penalties for any single factor. Division by zero *at all costs*.

**Explanation:** The “Ineffective” reflections highlight a pattern: overcomplication hurts. The most successful advice emphasizes *balance* achieved through tunable weights and robust functions (exponential decay).  Simplicity allows for faster iteration and easier debugging, while weighting allows adaptation to diverse problem instances.
