Okay, let's distill this into actionable advice for designing better bin-packing heuristics â€“ aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown based on synthesizing the "Current" & "Ineffective" reflections:

* **Keywords:** Fit, Waste (decayed), Stability, Simplicity, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *decayed* waste as a key differentiator alongside immediate fit. Start with a simple fit-first approach, *then* introduce waste penalties using exponential decay. Iteratively add complexity *only* if profiling shows clear benefit.
* **Avoid:** Complex, global normalizations or weighted combinations *initially*. Over-tuning parameters before establishing a robust baseline. Sigmoid functions and unnecessarily complex calculations.
* **Explanation:** The core tension is balancing exploration (waste management) with exploitation (immediate fit). Exponential decay on waste provides controlled exploration, preventing premature convergence on suboptimal solutions. Simplicity aids debugging & understanding.
