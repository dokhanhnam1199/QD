**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both utilize fit and waste, but the 1st uses a simple ratio while the 2nd adds an exponential decay based on total waste. This decay in the 2nd appears to add unnecessary complexity without clear benefit. Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the 3rd solely uses an exponential decay on waste, entirely neglecting fit which is crucial. Comparing 3rd vs 4th, 4th is identical to 1st. Comparing 5th vs 6th, they are identical.  5th/6th introduce a fit score as `1.0 / (waste + 1e-6)` combined with an exponential waste decay –  it’s a reasonable approach, but arguably less direct than simply considering fit relative to remaining capacity. Comparing 7th vs 8th, 7th adds a bin age bonus to the inverse waste, while 8th has a minimal implementation returning mostly zeros. Comparing 9th vs 10th, both utilize inverse waste with a small offset, but 10th is slightly clearer in its intent.  11th and 16th are similar in their base implementation but lack any sophisticated prioritization beyond inverse remaining capacity. 12th introduces a lot of unnecessary parameters. 13th and 15th boost the best fit, which is a good strategy. 14th and 17th and 19th and 20th attempt combinations of fit, waste, and age but become overly complex. 18th uses a sigmoid function which doesn’t seem to have a significant advantage.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 4th) consistently prioritize based on fit relative to remaining capacity, adding a small constant to avoid division by zero. Introducing complexity like waste decay or bin age doesn't consistently improve performance and can sometimes obscure the core logic. Simplicity and directness appear to be key.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and a clear signal of *fit*. Avoid unnecessary complexity (like decaying total waste) unless demonstrably beneficial. Focus on maximizing the use of available capacity with minimal waste. The best heuristics balance maximizing capacity utilization and minimizing fragmentation.
