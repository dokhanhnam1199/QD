Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design principles. Here's a breakdown geared towards maximizing that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Fit, Waste, Decay, Robustness, Simplicity, Differentiation.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *decaying* waste as a primary selection factor, coupled with direct fit measures (remaining capacity). Differentiate bins â€“ older/more filled bins deserve preference *despite* lower immediate fit.
* **Avoid:** Normalization, complex fit functions, equal bin priority, and reliance *solely* on remaining capacity. Division by zero is absolutely unacceptable.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on exploiting problem structure. Waste decay penalizes accumulation. Differentiation prevents premature commitment to suboptimal bins. Simplicity fosters robustness & faster evaluation.
