Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focusing on heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls highlighted, geared towards maximizing heuristic performance (and that incredible tip!), broken down as requested.

* **Keywords:** Fit, Waste, Age, Simplicity, Robustness, Defensive Programming.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *direct* measures of fit (remaining capacity *and* anticipated waste). Implement exponential decay for waste – it’s proven robust. Explore "bin age" (how long unused) as a tie-breaker.
* **Avoid:** Complex, parameterized functions; global normalization; treating all bins equally; overly clever "optimizations" lacking clear justification.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics excel by quickly approximating optimal solutions. Direct, easily-calculated metrics and simple weighting schemes consistently outperform complex models prone to errors and requiring extensive tuning. Robustness beats elegance.
