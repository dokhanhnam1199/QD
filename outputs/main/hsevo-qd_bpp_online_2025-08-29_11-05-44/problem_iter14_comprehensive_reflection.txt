Okay, let's refine heuristic design based on this self-reflection analysis – aiming for that $999K! Here’s a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Weighted scoring, Exponential decay, Robustness, Contextualization.
* **Advice:** Combine fit, waste (exponentially decayed), and bin age using *tunable* weights. Prioritize direct, measurable features over complex functions. Consider global context (total waste, overall bin age) to refine bin prioritization.
* **Avoid:** Normalization obscuring differences, sigmoid functions, solely relying on remaining capacity, and overlooking division-by-zero errors.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance simplicity *with* contextual awareness. Weights allow adaptation; exponential decay controls waste influence. Robustness ensures reliability. Tunability and simplicity are key to maintainability & performance.
