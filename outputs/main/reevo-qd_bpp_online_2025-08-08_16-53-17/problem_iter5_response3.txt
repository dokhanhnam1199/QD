[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` prioritizes bins with a small positive residual capacity after packing. This is a good "best-fit" strategy. However, the reflection suggests combining "best fit" with "worst fit reduction" and using softmax for exploration.

"Worst fit reduction" typically means penalizing bins that are too large, to avoid creating many large empty spaces. This can be achieved by assigning a lower priority to bins with a very large remaining capacity.

Softmax for exploration means that instead of picking the absolute highest priority bin, there's a probability of picking other bins based on their priority scores. This allows for exploration of less optimal but potentially good fits. The prompt, however, asks for a priority function that returns a score for *each* bin, implying that the selection logic (like softmax) would be applied *after* this function. Therefore, the priority function itself should produce scores that guide this selection.

Let's refine the priority function to incorporate:
1.  **Best Fit:** Prioritize bins where `remaining_capacity - item_size` is small and non-negative. This is already handled by `priority_v1`.
2.  **Worst Fit Reduction:** Penalize bins with excessively large remaining capacities. This means the priority should decrease as `remaining_capacity` grows very large.
3.  **Exact Fit Emphasis:** Give a slight boost to bins where `remaining_capacity == item_size`.

Combining these:
-   For bins that *cannot* fit the item, priority should be 0.
-   For bins that *can* fit the item:
    -   Calculate `excess_capacity = remaining_capacity - item_size`.
    -   We want a high score when `excess_capacity` is close to 0 (best fit).
    -   We want scores to decrease as `excess_capacity` increases beyond a certain point (worst fit reduction).
    -   An exact fit (`excess_capacity == 0`) should perhaps have a slightly higher score than a small positive `excess_capacity`.

Let's try a compound score:
`score = (1 - penalty_for_large_excess) * (benefit_for_small_excess)`

A simple way to implement "penalty for large excess" could be `1 / (1 + large_excess_capacity)` or similar.
A "benefit for small excess" can be the sigmoid-like function from `v1`, perhaps adjusted.

Alternative approach:
Let's define two components:
1.  `best_fit_score`: High for small non-negative `excess_capacity`.
2.  `penalty_score`: Low for large `remaining_capacity`.

Combine them multiplicatively or additively, perhaps with weights.

Let's reconsider the `v1` sigmoid: `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))`.
This function peaks at `excess_capacities = ideal_gap`.
-   If `ideal_gap = 0`, it peaks at exact fits.
-   If `ideal_gap = 0.05`, it peaks at a small gap.

To incorporate worst-fit reduction, we need a penalty for large `bins_remain_cap`.
Consider a function that decreases with `bins_remain_cap`. For example, `exp(-gamma * bins_remain_cap)`.

Let's try to combine the "goodness of fit" (small excess) with a "penalty for being too large" (large remaining capacity).

A potential approach:
For bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
1.  Calculate `excess_capacity = bins_remain_cap - item`.
2.  Define a "fit score": High when `excess_capacity` is near 0.
    -   `fit_score = exp(-k1 * excess_capacity)` could work. This gives 1 for `excess_capacity=0` and decreases.
3.  Define a "size penalty": Low when `bins_remain_cap` is small. High when `bins_remain_cap` is large.
    -   This is tricky. We want to *prioritize* bins that are not too large, but we don't want to penalize a bin just because it's large *if* it's a good fit.

Let's re-read the prompt: "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space. Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."

"Exact fits" -> `excess_capacity == 0`
"Minimal residual space" -> `excess_capacity` is small and non-negative.
"Best fit" -> Same as above.
"Worst fit reduction" -> Avoid bins that are *much* larger than needed.

This means we want to maximize `remaining_capacity - item` while keeping it small and non-negative, and also avoid very large `remaining_capacity` values.

Let's try this structure for bins that fit:
`priority = sigmoid_for_fit(excess_capacity) * penalty_for_large_capacity(remaining_capacity)`

-   `sigmoid_for_fit(excess_capacity)`: Should be high when `excess_capacity` is small. Let's use a shifted sigmoid peaking at 0.
    `1 / (1 + exp(k * excess_capacity))` -> Peaks at 1 when `excess_capacity = 0`. Decreases as `excess_capacity` increases.
    We can use `sigmoid(steepness * (-excess_capacity))`.

-   `penalty_for_large_capacity(remaining_capacity)`: Should be close to 1 for small `remaining_capacity` and decrease as `remaining_capacity` grows.
    `exp(-gamma * remaining_capacity)` is one option.

Let's consider combining "minimal residual space" and "worst fit reduction".
A common way to define a good fit for bin packing is to prioritize bins where `remaining_capacity` is slightly larger than `item`. The problem statement also mentions "minimal residual space" which implies `excess_capacity` should be small.

Consider the `v1` logic: `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))` where `ideal_gap = 0.05`.
This prioritizes a small positive gap.

To add "worst fit reduction", we want to reduce priority for bins that have very large `remaining_capacity`.
Let's try a multiplicative approach:
`priority = base_fit_score * size_penalty_factor`

`base_fit_score`: High for small `excess_capacity`.
`size_penalty_factor`: High for small `remaining_capacity`, low for large `remaining_capacity`.

Let's define `f_fit(x)` that gives a high score for small `x` (where `x = excess_capacity`).
And `f_penalty(y)` that gives a low score for large `y` (where `y = remaining_capacity`).

`f_fit(x) = exp(-k1 * x)` where `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. Max value 1 at `x=0`.
`f_penalty(y) = exp(-k2 * y)` where `y = bins_remain_cap`. Max value 1 at `y=0`.

Combining them: `priority = exp(-k1 * (bins_remain_cap - item)) * exp(-k2 * bins_remain_cap)`
`priority = exp(-k1 * bins_remain_cap + k1 * item - k2 * bins_remain_cap)`
`priority = exp(k1 * item) * exp(-(k1 + k2) * bins_remain_cap)`

This doesn't quite capture "minimal residual space" as a peak. It strongly penalizes large `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try to ensure the function prioritizes bins where `remaining_capacity` is close to `item`, but also reduces priority for bins that are "too empty" or "way too full".

Consider a score that has a peak for `bins_remain_cap` slightly larger than `item`.
Let `x = bins_remain_cap`.
We want high score when `x` is close to `item`.
We want to penalize `x >> item`.

Let's consider the *difference* from the ideal situation.
Ideal: `bins_remain_cap = item`.
Deviation 1: `bins_remain_cap > item`. We want this difference small.
Deviation 2: `bins_remain_cap < item`. This is not allowed.

Let's use a Gaussian-like shape for the "fit" component, centered slightly above `item`.
And then apply a penalty for large `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try to map the `excess_capacity` (`bins_remain_cap - item`) to a score.
-   `excess_capacity = 0` (exact fit): high score.
-   `excess_capacity` small positive: high score.
-   `excess_capacity` large positive: score decreases.

This is like `exp(-k * excess_capacity)`.
`score_fit = exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` for `bins_remain_cap >= item`.

Now, for "worst fit reduction," we want to penalize bins where `bins_remain_cap` is very large.
If `bins_remain_cap = 100` and `item = 1`, `excess_capacity = 99`. `score_fit` will be very low.
But if `bins_remain_cap = 1.05` and `item = 1`, `excess_capacity = 0.05`. `score_fit` will be high.

The "worst fit reduction" might be more about avoiding bins that are *much larger than necessary, even if they could fit the item*.
For example, if we have bins with capacities [5, 5, 100] and item is 3.
-   Bin 1: `remain=5`, `excess=2`.
-   Bin 2: `remain=5`, `excess=2`.
-   Bin 3: `remain=100`, `excess=97`.

We want to pick Bin 1 or 2 over Bin 3. `exp(-k * excess)` would already do this.
Perhaps "worst fit reduction" means if we have many bins that are good fits, we should prefer the ones that are not excessively large overall.

Let's consider the reciprocal of remaining capacity, perhaps?
No, that's for largest items.

Let's stick to the idea of prioritizing bins with minimal non-negative residual space, and reducing priority for bins that are excessively large.

Consider `priority = f(excess_capacity, remaining_capacity)`.
We want `f` to be high for small `excess_capacity` and also for small `remaining_capacity`.

Let's try a simple multiplicative model:
`priority = (score_for_small_excess) * (score_for_small_remaining_capacity)`

`score_for_small_excess(e) = exp(-k1 * e)` where `e = bins_remain_cap - item`. Max 1 at `e=0`.
`score_for_small_remaining_capacity(r) = exp(-k2 * r)` where `r = bins_remain_cap`. Max 1 at `r=0`.

This doesn't seem right. We want to prioritize bins with *some* remaining capacity, not zero.
The `ideal_gap` from `v1` is useful.

Let's try to combine `v1`'s logic with a penalty for large `bins_remain_cap`.
`v1` priority for fitting bins: `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))`
This score is high when `excess_capacity` is close to `ideal_gap` (e.g., 0.05).

To add worst-fit reduction:
We can subtract a penalty based on `bins_remain_cap`.
Or multiply by a factor that decreases with `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try multiplicative:
`priority = sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities)) * exp(-k * bins_remain_cap)`

Let's define:
`e = bins_remain_cap - item` (excess capacity)
`r = bins_remain_cap` (remaining capacity)

1.  **Exact Fit / Minimal Residual Space Score**: This should be high when `e` is close to 0.
    `fit_score = exp(-k_fit * e)` for `e >= 0`. This gives 1 for exact fit, and decreases for larger `e`.

2.  **Worst Fit Reduction Score**: This should be high for small `r` and decrease as `r` increases.
    `penalty_score = exp(-k_penalty * r)`. This gives a high score for bins that are already mostly full.

The problem is that we want to avoid bins that are *too empty*, not necessarily *too full*.
"Worst fit reduction" usually means avoiding filling a large bin with a small item if there's a small bin that can take it.

Let's re-interpret "worst fit reduction" in the context of prioritizing bins for *a single item*. It means, among bins that can fit the item, if one bin is much larger than another, and both provide a similar "fit score" (e.g., excess capacity), we might prefer the smaller bin to avoid "wasting" the large bin's capacity.

Consider two bins:
Bin A: `remain = 10`, `item = 8`. `excess = 2`.
Bin B: `remain = 100`, `item = 8`. `excess = 92`.

`exp(-k * excess)` would give much higher priority to Bin A. This naturally handles the reduction of priority for large excess.

What if bins are:
Bin A: `remain = 10`, `item = 8`. `excess = 2`.
Bin B: `remain = 11`, `item = 8`. `excess = 3`.

Here, `excess` is small for both.
`exp(-k * excess)` would favor Bin A.
The `v1` sigmoid `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))` with `ideal_gap=0.05`:
-   Bin A (`excess = 2`): `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 2))` -> very small value.
-   Bin B (`excess = 3`): `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 3))` -> even smaller value.
This means `v1` is not good at penalizing larger excesses.

Let's go back to the `v1` approach but make it more sensitive to the *magnitude* of `excess_capacity`.
The `v1` sigmoid `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))` has its midpoint at `ideal_gap`.
Scores > 0.5 for `excess_capacity < ideal_gap`.
Scores < 0.5 for `excess_capacity > ideal_gap`.

To penalize larger excesses more, we need the score to drop faster after `ideal_gap`.
This is controlled by `steepness`.

Let's try a different function for the fit score that's more aggressive in penalizing larger excesses.
A negative exponential `exp(-k * excess_capacity)` might be better.

Combined strategy:
1.  Prioritize bins that fit.
2.  Among fitting bins, prioritize those with small `excess_capacity`.
3.  Among those with small `excess_capacity`, also penalize bins that have very large `remaining_capacity` overall (to avoid spreading items thinly across many large bins).

Let's define a function that maps `bins_remain_cap` to a preference score.
For fitting bins:
`excess = bins_remain_cap - item`

We want to reward small `excess`, and penalize large `bins_remain_cap`.
Consider a score that is `f(excess) * g(remaining_capacity)`.

`f(excess)`: High for small `excess`. E.g., `exp(-k1 * excess)`.
`g(remaining_capacity)`: This is the tricky part for "worst fit reduction".
If we want to avoid very large bins, then `g` should decrease with `remaining_capacity`.
However, if a bin is large but is a perfect or near-perfect fit for a large item, we don't want to penalize it too much.

Let's simplify: "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space." This means `excess_capacity` near 0 is best.
"Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."

"Worst fit reduction" in the context of online BPP often means that if an item fits into multiple bins with similar "best-fit" properties, the heuristic should prefer the bin that is less "empty" overall.

Let's try to prioritize based on two criteria:
1.  `excess_capacity`: Minimize this.
2.  `remaining_capacity`: If `excess_capacity` is similar, prefer smaller `remaining_capacity`.

This can be achieved by making the priority depend on `excess_capacity` primarily, and then using `remaining_capacity` as a tie-breaker or secondary factor.

Let's try this composite score:
`priority = (some_function_of_excess) - (some_function_of_remaining_capacity)`
(Subtracting a function of `remaining_capacity` means larger `remaining_capacity` leads to lower priority).

Or, perhaps `priority = (some_function_of_excess) / (some_function_of_remaining_capacity)`? No, division can be unstable.

Let's go with a multiplicative approach again.
`priority = score_based_on_excess * score_based_on_remaining_capacity_penalty`

`score_based_on_excess`: High for small `excess`.
Let `e = bins_remain_cap - item`.
`score_excess = exp(-k1 * e)` for `e >= 0`. (Values are between (0, 1]).

`score_based_on_remaining_capacity_penalty`: We want to penalize bins with very large `remaining_capacity`.
This means the score should decrease as `remaining_capacity` grows.
`score_penalty = exp(-k2 * bins_remain_cap)`. This penalizes bins that are mostly empty.
This might be counter-productive. We want to fill bins, so large remaining capacity is good if it leads to a good fit.

Let's revisit the reflection points:
-   "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space." -> `excess_capacity` close to 0.
-   "Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'." -> Avoid overly large bins when alternatives exist.

Consider the target state: a bin with just enough capacity for the item.
The deviation from this target state has two components:
1.  `excess_capacity = bin.remaining - item`: want this small and non-negative.
2.  `bin.remaining`: want this also not excessively large if `excess_capacity` is similar across bins.

Let's try to directly optimize for `bins_remain_cap - item` being small and positive, and `bins_remain_cap` also being small.

Consider a scoring function `S(r)` for a bin with remaining capacity `r`.
For an item `i`:
`priority(r, i)`:
If `r < i`: `0`
If `r >= i`:
  `e = r - i` (excess capacity)
  We want high score for small `e`.
  We want high score for small `r`.

This means we are looking for `(r, e)` pairs where both `r` and `e` are small.
This is a multi-objective optimization.

Let's try a combined metric that emphasizes small `e` first, then small `r`.
A common way is `score = f(e) - k * r` or `score = f(e) / g(r)`.

Let's try `score = exp(-k1 * e) * exp(-k2 * r)` again, but think about the interpretation.
`score = exp(-k1 * (r - i)) * exp(-k2 * r)`
`score = exp(k1 * i) * exp(-(k1 + k2) * r)`
This score is *independent* of `e` and only depends on `r`. It heavily penalizes large `r`. This is too simple.

Let's rethink the "worst fit reduction".
If item `i` fits in bin `B1` with `rem_cap1 = i + e1` and bin `B2` with `rem_cap2 = i + e2`.
If `e1 < e2`, we prefer `B1`.
If `e1` and `e2` are very close (e.g. `abs(e1-e2) < epsilon`), AND `rem_cap1 < rem_cap2`, we prefer `B1`.

This suggests a lexicographical ordering or a weighted sum.

Let's try a weighted sum of "goodness" metrics.
Metric 1: Proximity of `bins_remain_cap` to `item`.
   -   High when `bins_remain_cap` is `item` or slightly larger.
   -   Lower as `bins_remain_cap` deviates.

Metric 2: Size of `bins_remain_cap`.
   -   Lower when `bins_remain_cap` is very large.

Let's define `score_proximity(r, i)`:
   -   For `r < i`, score is 0.
   -   For `r >= i`, we want a peak around `r = i + ideal_gap`.
   -   A Gaussian-like function: `exp(-k * (r - (i + ideal_gap))^2)`
   -   This gives a peak when `r = i + ideal_gap`.

Let's define `score_size_penalty(r)`:
   -   We want this to decrease with `r`.
   -   `exp(-k_penalty * r)`: decreases with `r`.

Combine: `priority = score_proximity * score_size_penalty`
`priority = exp(-k * (r - (i + ideal_gap))^2) * exp(-k_penalty * r)`
`priority = exp( -k * (r^2 - 2r(i+ideal_gap) + (i+ideal_gap)^2) - k_penalty * r )`

This looks like a plausible combination.
Let `i` be the `item`.
Let `r` be `bins_remain_cap`.

We need:
-   `ideal_gap`: a small positive value, e.g., 0.05.
-   `k_proximity`: controls how sharp the peak is around the ideal fit. Higher `k_proximity` means only very close fits get high scores.
-   `k_penalty`: controls how much large remaining capacities are penalized.

Let's test the behavior:
-   If `r < i`: `priority` should be 0.
-   If `r >= i`:
    -   If `r` is very large (e.g., `r >> i + ideal_gap`), the `exp(-k_penalty * r)` term will make the priority very low. This achieves "worst fit reduction" by penalizing very empty bins.
    -   If `r` is close to `i + ideal_gap`, `score_proximity` will be high.
    -   If `r` is small, `score_penalty` will be high.

Example: bins_remain_cap = [5, 10, 100], item = 3.
-   Bin 1: r=5. `i=3`. `e=2`. `ideal_gap = 0.05`.
    `score_proximity = exp(-k * (5 - (3 + 0.05))^2) = exp(-k * (1.95)^2)`
    `score_penalty = exp(-k_p * 5)`
    `priority_1 = exp(-k * 3.8025) * exp(-5 * k_p)`

-   Bin 2: r=10. `i=3`. `e=7`.
    `score_proximity = exp(-k * (10 - (3 + 0.05))^2) = exp(-k * (6.95)^2)`
    `score_penalty = exp(-k_p * 10)`
    `priority_2 = exp(-k * 48.3025) * exp(-10 * k_p)`

-   Bin 3: r=100. `i=3`. `e=97`.
    `score_proximity = exp(-k * (100 - (3 + 0.05))^2) = exp(-k * (96.95)^2)`
    `score_penalty = exp(-k_p * 100)`
    `priority_3 = exp(-k * 9400.3025) * exp(-100 * k_p)`

This seems to penalize large `r` too aggressively, even if the `ideal_gap` is met.
The `score_proximity` is already sensitive to deviation from the ideal.

Let's try making `score_proximity` itself handle the "minimal residual space" part and "exact fit" boost.
And "worst fit reduction" is about avoiding bins that are unnecessarily large *given* they can fit the item.

Alternative perspective:
The goal is to select a bin.
Consider the residual capacity *after* packing: `r_new = r - item`.
We want `r_new` to be small and non-negative.
We also want `r` to be small.

Let's modify the `v1` sigmoid.
`v1_score = sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))`
This score is high when `excess_capacity` is close to `ideal_gap`.

How to add "worst fit reduction"?
If `excess_capacity` is small for two bins, but one bin has much larger `remaining_capacity` overall, we might prefer the smaller bin.

Let's modify the input to the sigmoid.
Instead of `ideal_gap - excess_capacity`, let's use something that penalizes large `remaining_capacity`.

Consider a score `s = f(bins_remain_cap, item)`.
If `bins_remain_cap < item`, `s = 0`.
If `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
  `excess = bins_remain_cap - item`.
  We want to prioritize small `excess`.
  We want to penalize large `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try to define the "quality" of a bin `r` for an item `i` as a score `q(r, i)`.
`q(r, i)` should be high if `r` is just slightly larger than `i`, and `r` itself is not excessively large.

Consider a combination of two factors:
1.  `fit_quality`: How well does `r` match `i`? Peak when `r = i + ideal_gap`.
    `fit_quality = exp(-k_fit * (r - (i + ideal_gap))^2)`

2.  `bin_size_preference`: How desirable is bin size `r` in general?
    Perhaps we want smaller `r` to be preferred.
    `bin_size_pref = exp(-k_size * r)`

This leads back to the multiplicative combination:
`priority = exp(-k_fit * (r - (i + ideal_gap))^2) * exp(-k_size * r)`

Let's tune parameters for this.
`k_fit`: determines how sensitive we are to the exact fit.
`k_size`: determines how much we penalize large bins.

Let's re-evaluate the "minimal residual space" and "exact fits" from the reflection.
"Prioritize exact fits": This means `r = i` should be very good.
"then minimal residual space": This means `r = i + epsilon` (small epsilon) is also good.

The Gaussian approach `exp(-k * (r - (i + ideal_gap))^2)` peaks at `ideal_gap`.
To include exact fits strongly, maybe the peak should be at `ideal_gap = 0`.
`score_proximity = exp(-k_fit * (r - i)^2)` for `r >= i`.

Now, for "worst fit reduction".
If we have `r1 = i` and `r2 = i + 100`, and `item` is `i`.
`score_proximity` for `r1`: `exp(-k_fit * (i - i)^2) = exp(0) = 1`.
`score_proximity` for `r2`: `exp(-k_fit * (i + 100 - i)^2) = exp(-k_fit * 100^2)`. Very small.
This already handles penalizing large excess.

Perhaps the "worst fit reduction" means something else.
What if the problem is about avoiding the creation of many large empty bins?
If we put a small item into a huge bin that has `excess = 1000`, we create a huge empty space.

Let's consider this: we want `r - item` to be small AND non-negative.
And we want `r` to be small.

What if we simply maximize a function that represents "emptiness"?
We want to minimize `r - item`.
And minimize `r`.

This is like finding a point `(item, 0)` in `(r, r-item)` space.
We want to be close to this point.

Let's try a score that penalizes both large `r` and large `r-item`.
`score = -w1 * (r - item)^2 - w2 * r` (for `r >= item`)
`score = -w1 * r^2 + 2*w1*r*item - w1*item^2 - w2*r`
This is a quadratic in `r`.
The term `(r - item)^2` penalizes excess.
The term `r` penalizes large remaining capacity.

The term `2*w1*r*item` suggests that for larger items, larger `r` might be tolerated.

Let's try a simpler form: `score = -(r - item) - penalty_factor * r`
This is `score = -r + item - penalty_factor * r = item - (1 + penalty_factor) * r`.
This still heavily favors small `r`.

Let's return to the reflection: "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space."
And "Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."

This suggests a preference for `r` such that `r - item` is small and non-negative.
And also a preference for smaller `r` values overall.

Let's try a score that directly models this preference.
Let `e = r - item`.
We want to maximize `f(e)` where `f` is high for small `e`.
And we want to maximize `g(r)` where `g` is high for small `r`.

If `r < item`, score is 0.
If `r >= item`:
  `e = r - item`.
  `score = -(e^2) - k * r`
  This penalizes large `e` and large `r`.
  The `e^2` term ensures "minimal residual space".
  The `k * r` term ensures "worst fit reduction" by penalizing large bins.

Let's test this with bins [5, 10, 100] and item = 3.
`k` is a parameter controlling the penalty for large bins. Let `k = 0.1`.
-   Bin 1: r=5, i=3. e=2.
    `score = -(2^2) - 0.1 * 5 = -4 - 0.5 = -4.5`
-   Bin 2: r=10, i=3. e=7.
    `score = -(7^2) - 0.1 * 10 = -49 - 1.0 = -50.0`
-   Bin 3: r=100, i=3. e=97.
    `score = -(97^2) - 0.1 * 100 = -9409 - 10.0 = -9419.0`

This prioritizes Bin 1. This seems reasonable.
What about "exact fits"?
If we have item = 5, bins = [5, 6, 100].
-   Bin 1: r=5, i=5. e=0.
    `score = -(0^2) - 0.1 * 5 = -0.5`
-   Bin 2: r=6, i=5. e=1.
    `score = -(1^2) - 0.1 * 6 = -1 - 0.6 = -1.6`
-   Bin 3: r=100, i=5. e=95.
    `score = -(95^2) - 0.1 * 100 = -9025 - 10.0 = -9035.0`

This prioritizes Bin 1 (exact fit). Good.
The score is negative, so we want the largest (least negative) score.

Consider parameter tuning.
If `k` is very small, `r` preference is weak.
If `k` is very large, `r` preference dominates.

Let's consider "minimal residual space".
If item=5, bins=[5.1, 5.2, 6].
-   Bin 1: r=5.1, i=5. e=0.1.
    `score = -(0.1^2) - 0.1 * 5.1 = -0.01 - 0.51 = -0.52`
-   Bin 2: r=5.2, i=5. e=0.2.
    `score = -(0.2^2) - 0.1 * 5.2 = -0.04 - 0.52 = -0.56`
-   Bin 3: r=6, i=5. e=1.
    `score = -(1^2) - 0.1 * 6 = -1 - 0.6 = -1.6`

This prioritizes Bin 1 (0.1 excess) over Bin 2 (0.2 excess). This is correct for "minimal residual space".

The scores are negative. A sigmoid transformation can map these to positive values if needed for later probability calculation, but the relative order is what matters for priority.

The prompt asks for priority score for *each* bin.
The score `-(excess^2) - k * bins_remain_cap` for fitting bins seems to capture the requirements well.

We need to choose `k`. The choice of `k` balances "minimal residual space" against "worst fit reduction" (avoiding large bins).
A higher `k` means we are more concerned about bin size.

Let's set `k = 0.05` as a starting point.
The function to be applied to `bins_remain_cap` for fitting bins is `lambda r, i, k: -(r - i)**2 - k * r`.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This heuristic aims to prioritize bins that offer the "best fit" (minimal
    residual space) for the item, while also incorporating a "worst fit
    reduction" strategy by penalizing bins that have excessively large
    remaining capacities.

    The priority is calculated based on two factors for bins where the item fits:
    1.  Minimal Residual Space: Penalizes the square of the excess capacity
        (remaining_capacity - item). This encourages exact fits and small gaps.
    2.  Worst Fit Reduction: Penalizes the remaining capacity of the bin itself.
        This discourages using very large bins when smaller ones might suffice
        for the current item's fit quality.

    The function returns a score for each bin. Higher scores indicate a more
    desirable bin for the item. Bins where the item does not fit are assigned
    a priority of 0.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.

    return priorities

```
Testing the implementation logic:
-   `fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item` correctly identifies fitting bins.
-   `excess_capacities = fitting_bins_remain_cap - item` is correct.
-   The score formula `scores = -(k_excess * (excess_capacities**2)) - (k_size_penalty * fitting_bins_remain_cap)` combines the two objectives:
    -   `-(excess_capacities**2)`: Favors small `excess_capacities` (minimal residual space, exact fits if `k_excess` is high).
    -   `-k_size_penalty * fitting_bins_remain_cap`: Favors smaller `fitting_bins_remain_cap` (worst fit reduction).
-   The use of negative signs means higher scores are less negative. This is a valid way to represent priority.
-   Bins that don't fit get 0 priority.

The parameters `k_excess` and `k_size_penalty` need tuning based on the specific problem instance (e.g., bin capacity range, item size distribution). The current values are illustrative.
`k_excess = 1.0` makes the squared excess capacity a significant factor.
`k_size_penalty = 0.05` gives a moderate penalty for large bins.

Consider the reflection: "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space."
If `excess_capacities = 0`, the term is 0. If `excess_capacities = 0.1`, the term is `-(0.1)^2 = -0.01`. This clearly prioritizes exact fits.

"Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."
The two terms achieve this. The first term is "best fit". The second term is "worst fit reduction" by penalizing large capacities.

The output format is a numpy array of scores. This is what was requested.
The prompt asks for *code only*. The docstring should be part of the code.

```

The code looks good and follows the reflection.
The scoring function `-(k_excess * (excess_capacities**2)) - (k_size_penalty * fitting_bins_remain_cap)` directly implements the desired trade-offs.

Final check on prompt requirements:
- Output Python code only: Yes.
- Enclose code with Python code block: Yes.
- Function signature `priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray`: Yes.
- Implements reflection: Yes.

The reflection mentioned softmax for exploration. This function provides the scores that *could* be used with softmax. The function itself does not implement softmax selection. This is appropriate as the function's role is to provide priority scores.

One minor consideration: if all fitting bins have negative scores, and the non-fitting bins have 0, the non-fitting bins will be selected by a max-score rule. This is incorrect. Bins that don't fit should *never* be selected if fitting bins exist. The current assignment of 0 priority for non-fitting bins and potentially negative scores for fitting bins means that if all fitting bins have negative scores, a non-fitting bin (priority 0) would appear better.

To fix this, we should ensure fitting bins always have a positive priority, or use a mechanism that explicitly ignores non-fitting bins.
A simple fix: shift all scores by a large constant or ensure the minimum score for fitting bins is > 0.
Let `min_score_for_fitting = np.min(scores)` if `np.any(fits_mask)` else 0.
If `min_score_for_fitting < 0`:
  `shift = -min_score_for_fitting + epsilon` (e.g., `epsilon = 0.001`)
  `priorities[fits_mask] = scores + shift`

Or, more directly:
Let's ensure the score for any fitting bin is at least some small positive value.
The scoring function `-(k_excess * (excess_capacities**2)) - (k_size_penalty * fitting_bins_remain_cap)` will always be negative or zero (if `excess_capacities=0` and `fitting_bins_remain_cap=0`, which is unlikely but possible if item=0).
To make sure fitting bins are always preferred over non-fitting bins (priority 0), we need to shift the scores.

Let's try shifting the scores so that the maximum possible score is 1, and minimum is 0, or simply ensure the lowest score for fitting bins is > 0.

Let's map the scores to a `[0, 1]` range.
If there are fitting bins:
`min_possible_score = -(k_size_penalty * max_bin_capacity)` (if `k_excess=0`, and `excess=0`)
`max_possible_score = 0` (if `excess=0`)

The current scores are roughly in the range `[-large_value, 0]`.
If we shift them: `shifted_scores = scores - np.min(scores[fits_mask])` (if `fits_mask` is true).
This maps the minimum score to 0. Then we can normalize by the max.
`normalized_scores = (shifted_scores - np.min(shifted_scores)) / (np.max(shifted_scores) - np.min(shifted_scores))`

This might be too complex for a "priority score" which just needs to be comparable.
The simplest is to ensure the scores are positive.
Let `base_priority = 1.0`.
Then `final_priority = base_priority + scores`.
This will make scores between `1.0 - large_value` and `1.0`.
Non-fitting bins would get `0`. If `1.0 - large_value` is negative, non-fitting bins might still be picked.

Let's just add a constant to ensure positivity.
`priorities[fits_mask] = scores + shift_amount`.
What's a safe `shift_amount`? It should be large enough to make the most negative score positive.
The most negative score occurs when `excess_capacities` and `fitting_bins_remain_cap` are maximal.
Let `max_item` be the max item size, `max_bin_cap` be the max bin capacity.
Worst score approx: `-(k_excess * (max_bin_cap - 0)^2) - (k_size_penalty * max_bin_cap)`
This can be very negative.

A simpler approach for priority:
Let's use `np.exp(scores)` for fitting bins. This maps `[-inf, 0]` to `[0, 1]`.
`priorities[fits_mask] = np.exp(scores)`
This would result in:
-   Exact fit with 0 excess: `exp(0) = 1`.
-   Small excess: `exp(-small_positive) < 1`.
-   Large excess: `exp(-large_positive)` close to 0.
-   Large bins: `exp(-k_size_penalty * r)` will also be small.

This `np.exp(scores)` transformation seems good. It maps the relative goodness to `[0, 1]`.
A score of 0 (exact fit, no size penalty) maps to 1.
More negative scores map to values closer to 0.
This ensures fitting bins have priorities between 0 and 1. Non-fitting bins have 0. This is correct.
