def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a refined Sigmoid Fit Score.

    This heuristic aims to prioritize bins that offer the "best fit" for the item.
    A "best fit" is defined as a bin where the remaining capacity is only slightly
    larger than the item's size. This strategy tries to fill bins as much as possible
    without leaving excessive empty space, thereby minimizing fragmentation.

    The priority is calculated using a sigmoid function. The function is designed
    to peak when the remaining capacity (`bins_remain_cap`) is precisely equal to
    the item's size, and the priority decreases as the remaining capacity deviates
    (either smaller or larger). However, bins where the item doesn't fit at all
    are assigned a zero priority.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array where each element is the remaining capacity of a bin.

    Returns:
        A numpy array of the same size as `bins_remain_cap`, containing the priority
        score for each bin. Higher scores indicate a more desirable bin for the item.

        # A common formulation for "good fit" prioritizes `excess_capacity` close to 0.

        # To align with "slightly larger" being the peak priority (as per problem description interpretation),

        # Values of `excess_capacities` smaller than `ideal_gap` (but >= 0) will yield scores > 0.5.
        # Values of `excess_capacities` larger than `ideal_gap` will yield scores < 0.5.
