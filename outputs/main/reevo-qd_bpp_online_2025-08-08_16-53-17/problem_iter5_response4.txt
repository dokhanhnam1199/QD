    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a refined Sigmoid Fit Score.

    This heuristic aims to prioritize bins that offer the "best fit" for the item,
    defined as a bin where the remaining capacity is only slightly larger than the
    item's size. This strategy tries to fill bins as much as possible without leaving
    excessive empty space, thereby minimizing fragmentation.

    Additionally, it incorporates a "worst fit reduction" concept by slightly penalizing
    bins that have a very large remaining capacity, pushing towards using bins that
    are closer to being full if a good fit isn't available, but still prioritizing
    exact or near-exact fits.

    The priority is calculated using a sigmoid function for near-exact fits and a
    linear decay for larger excesses to slightly favor smaller remaining capacities
    among the non-ideal fits.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array where each element is the remaining capacity of a bin.

    Returns:
        A numpy array of the same size as `bins_remain_cap`, containing the priority
        score for each bin. Higher scores indicate a more desirable bin for the item.

        # The sigmoid already handles the "peak" at ideal_gap. For excess > ideal_gap,

        # We want to ensure that excess = 0 (if it exists) is also highly rated, and potentially higher.
        #
        # Let's refine `best_fit_scores` to be more peaky at `ideal_gap` and then decay.
        # The current sigmoid `1/(1+exp(-steepness*(ideal_gap - excess)))` means:
        # excess < ideal_gap -> score > 0.5
        # excess = ideal_gap -> score = 0.5
        # excess > ideal_gap -> score < 0.5
        # This isn't quite right for "peak priority at ideal_gap".
        # For peak priority at `ideal_gap`, the argument should be 0.
        # `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (x - c)))` has midpoint at `c`.
        # To peak at `ideal_gap`, we want `ideal_gap` to map to the maximum.
        # If we invert the argument or shift it:
        # `sigmoid(steepness * (excess_capacities - ideal_gap))` has midpoint at `ideal_gap`.
        # This will give scores that *increase* as excess increases. Not good.
        #
        # Correct sigmoid for peak at `ideal_gap` for `excess_capacities`:
        # Consider a Gaussian-like shape, or a different function.
        # Or adjust the sigmoid's range.
        # If we want scores to be highest at `ideal_gap`, we want the argument to `exp` to be minimal (most negative) at `ideal_gap`.
        # Let the argument be `-steepness * abs(excess_capacities - ideal_gap)`.
        # This is not a sigmoid.
        #
        # Let's stick to the idea of `sigmoid(steepness * (center - x))`.
        # If `center = ideal_gap`, scores increase with `excess`.
        # If we want scores to *decrease* from a peak at `ideal_gap`:
        # Consider `1 - sigmoid(...)`. `1 - sigmoid(x)` is a sigmoid itself, just inverted.
        # `1 - sigmoid(steepness * (excess_capacities - ideal_gap))`
        # This peaks at 1 when `excess_capacities = ideal_gap`.

        # Re-evaluate the sigmoid for best fit:
        # We want a high score when `excess_capacity` is close to `ideal_gap`.
        # Let `score = exp(-k * (excess_capacity - ideal_gap)^2)` - Gaussian, but not a sigmoid.
        #
        # Let's use the sigmoid for a smooth transition.
        # A common way to get a peak is to use a logistic function centered on the desired value.
        # `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacity))`
        # This gives priority values that decrease from 1 (at `excess_capacity << ideal_gap`) to 0 (at `excess_capacity >> ideal_gap`), with a transition around `ideal_gap`.
        # This means it prioritizes bins with *less* excess capacity.
        #
        # To prioritize `ideal_gap` specifically:
        # We can use a "bell curve" shape, or combine two sigmoids.
        # For simplicity and staying within sigmoid framework, let's modify the `sigmoid` to map values.
        # `sigmoid(x)` ranges from 0 to 1. We want a function `g(excess_capacity)` that is max at `ideal_gap`.
        #
        # Let's define a priority score that captures:
        # 1. High priority for `excess_capacity` near `ideal_gap`.
        # 2. Decent priority for `excess_capacity == 0` (exact fit).
        # 3. Priority decreases as `excess_capacity` increases.

        # Re-thinking: Prioritize "best fit" = minimal positive remainder.
        # Then, prioritize "least waste" = minimal non-negative remainder.
        # So, `excess_capacity = 0` is good, `excess_capacity = 0.01` is better, `excess_capacity = 0.1` is okay, `excess_capacity = 1` is bad.

        # Let's assign scores based on the magnitude of `excess_capacity`:
        # Small excess_capacity (near 0) should be penalized slightly less than larger ones.
        # This sounds like a decreasing function of `excess_capacity`.

        # Priority = 1 / (1 + `excess_capacity`^p) or similar decay.
        # `excess_capacity` itself is a strong indicator.
        # `sigmoid(k * (ideal_gap - excess_capacity))` already makes it decrease.
        # Let's use `ideal_gap = 0` for absolute minimal waste, and then consider the "slightly larger" aspect.

        # --- Revised Strategy ---
        # 1. Exact fit (`excess_capacity == 0`) is best.
        # 2. Near-exact fit (`excess_capacity` small positive) is also very good.
        # 3. Larger excess is progressively worse.

        # We can use a function that maps `excess_capacity` to priority.
        # Let `p(x)` be the priority for excess `x`.
        # `p(0)` should be high.
        # `p(small_positive)` should be high, potentially even higher than `p(0)`.
        # `p(large_positive)` should be low.

        # Let's use a function `f(x) = exp(-k * x)`.
        # `f(0) = 1`. `f(small_positive)` < 1. This favors exact fits.
        # To favor `ideal_gap`: `f(x) = exp(-k * abs(x - ideal_gap))`.
        # This gives a peak at `ideal_gap`, but the function decays on both sides.
        # This is closer to the original description's intent ("slightly larger").

        # Let's use `sigmoid(steepness * (center - x))` where `center` is `ideal_gap`.
        # `priority = sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))`
        # This gives high scores for `excess_capacities < ideal_gap` and low for `excess_capacities > ideal_gap`.
        # The peak of this function is not at `ideal_gap` itself, it's where the argument is 0.
        # The *midpoint* of the sigmoid is at `ideal_gap`.
        #
        # If we want the highest score to be associated with `ideal_gap`, we can use the sigmoid's output as a base.
        #
        # Let's consider `excess_capacity` directly:
        # Score = 1 / (1 + `excess_capacity`**power)
        # If power=1, Score = 1 / (1 + excess_capacity). Decays from 1 to 0.
        # If power=2, Score = 1 / (1 + excess_capacity**2). Decays faster.
        # This favors smaller excesses.

        # Let's try a combination that specifically targets "minimal excess" and then "least waste".
        # Minimal excess = `excess_capacity` near 0.
        # Least waste = `excess_capacity` is small.

        # We can use a two-part function or a single function that behaves piecewise.
        # `priority(excess_capacity)`:
        # If `excess_capacity` < `ideal_gap`: `sigmoid(steepness_early * (ideal_gap - excess_capacity))` (favoring smaller gaps)
        # If `excess_capacity` >= `ideal_gap`: `sigmoid(steepness_late * (excess_capacity - ideal_gap))` (penalizing larger gaps)
        # This creates a peak at `ideal_gap`.

        # Let's use `ideal_gap = 0.01` (a very small positive value).
        ideal_gap = 0.01
        steepness_early = 20.0 # Steep decline for small excesses below ideal_gap
        steepness_late = 10.0  # Gradual decline for excesses above ideal_gap

        # For excess < ideal_gap, we want higher scores as excess approaches 0.
        # `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))` gives scores that DECREASE as excess increases.
        # This is correct for "preferring less excess".
        # So, for `excess < ideal_gap`, `sigmoid(steepness_early * (ideal_gap - excess))` is good.

        # For excess >= ideal_gap, we want scores to decrease as excess increases.
        # `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))` still works for this part.
        # The transition is what matters.

        # Let's use a single sigmoid that peaks appropriately.
        # Consider a function that is high for `excess = 0` and `excess = ideal_gap`, and lower in between or for larger values.
        #
        # How about:
        # Priority = `(1 - sigmoid(steepness_1 * excess))`  # Prioritizes exact fits (score 1 at excess=0)
        #            + `sigmoid(steepness_2 * (ideal_gap - excess))` # Bonus for near-exact fits
        # Need to normalize weights.

        # Let's try a different perspective: the "worst fit reduction" aims to pick the bin
        # that *least* increases the total waste.
        # If we have bins with capacities [10, 5, 2] and item is 3:
        # Bin 1: remains [7, 5, 2]. Waste = 7.
        # Bin 2: remains [10, 2, 2]. Waste = 10.
        # Bin 3: remains [10, 5, -1]. Invalid.
        # Worst fit would pick bin 2.

        # For online BPP with the goal of minimizing bins, we want to fill bins.
        # Prioritize "best fit" for tight packing.
        # If no good fit, then "first fit" or "worst fit" among valid bins.
        #
        # The reflection says: "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space. Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."
        #
        # Minimal residual space = `excess_capacity` close to 0.
        # "Worst fit reduction" can mean: among bins that are NOT near-perfect fits, pick the one that is "least empty".
        # This means picking the bin with largest remaining capacity among those that aren't "best fits".
        # This sounds contradictory to minimizing total waste.

        # Let's interpret "worst fit reduction" as: "Don't leave *too much* excess if a better option exists".
        # OR: "Among bins that aren't perfect/near-perfect fits, pick the one that is relatively fullest."
        #
        # The current `priority_v1` is essentially a "best fit" heuristic.
        #
        # Let's focus on the "refined Sigmoid Fit Score".
        # The description for v1 implies a peak at a slight positive excess.
        # `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacity))`
        # This function maps `ideal_gap` to 0.5.
        # For `excess < ideal_gap`, scores > 0.5.
        # For `excess > ideal_gap`, scores < 0.5.
        # So, it favors LESS excess capacity.

        # To make it peak at `ideal_gap`:
        # We need a function that is maximal at `ideal_gap`.
        # Let's scale the `excess_capacities` and use a Sigmoid that peaks.
        # A common way to model this is using a modified logistic function or a bell curve.
        #
        # Consider a function `f(x)` where `x = excess_capacity`.
        # Peak at `ideal_gap`.
        # `f(x) = exp(-k * (x - ideal_gap)**2)` (Gaussian)
        #
        # Alternative sigmoid approach:
        # Map `excess_capacity` to a range, then apply sigmoid.
        # `priorities[fits_mask] = sigmoid(steepness, center=ideal_gap)` applied to `excess_capacities`.
        # The `sigmoid` function is `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (x - center)))`.
        # This means `center` is where the sigmoid value is 0.5.
        #
        # If we want peak at `ideal_gap`, we can use `1 - sigmoid(steepness * (excess - ideal_gap))`
        # `1 - (1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (excess - ideal_gap))))`
        # `= exp(-steepness * (excess - ideal_gap)) / (1 + exp(-steepness * (excess - ideal_gap)))`
        # This is the logistic function `logistic(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))`.

        # When excess_capacity = 2*ideal_gap, score = logistic(-steepness * ideal_gap) (less than 0.5)
        # This favors small positive gaps over exact fits, which is what "slightly larger" implies.

        # Now, incorporate "worst fit reduction".
        # This part is tricky to interpret as a *reduction* while also prioritizing *minimal* residual space.
        # If "worst fit reduction" means: don't pick a bin with excessively large remaining capacity if other good options exist.
        # The current scores already decay for larger excesses.
        #
        # Let's consider a slight adjustment:
        # For bins with `excess_capacity > some_threshold`, slightly reduce their score to favor bins that are generally fuller.
        #
        # If we want to also capture "least waste" as a secondary objective:
        # Use a combined score.
        # Score = w1 * (priority for ideal_gap) + w2 * (priority for minimal excess)
        #
        # Let's re-read: "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space. Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."
        # Minimal residual space = minimal `excess_capacity`.
        # Best fit = `excess_capacity` near 0 or `ideal_gap`.
        # Worst fit reduction: This usually means choosing the bin with the largest remaining capacity.
        # Applying a "reduction" to this could mean making it less attractive, or capping its benefit.

        # Let's give `score_A` more weight.
        weight_A = 1.0
        weight_B = 0.5 # Give less weight to exact fit bonus

        combined_score = weight_A * score_A + weight_B * score_B

        # Component C: "Worst fit reduction".
        # This implies that if there are many bins with large excess capacities,
        # we might want to pick the one with the largest capacity to keep smaller capacities for later small items.
        # This is the core of "worst fit".
        # "Worst fit reduction" might mean: DO NOT pick the bin with the largest excess if a near-perfect fit exists.
        # Or: Slightly penalize bins with large excess to encourage fuller bins overall.

        # Let's adjust the combined score to penalize large excesses more.
        # If `excess_capacity` is large, the current scores already drop.
        # We can add a term that aggressively reduces scores for large excesses.
        #
        # Let's define a "penalty" for large excess.
        # `penalty = sigmoid(steepness_penalty * (excess_capacities - large_threshold))`
        # This penalty is 0.5 at `large_threshold`, and increases.
        # We want to SUBTRACT this penalty.
        #
        # Example: Item = 1, bins = [10, 10, 1.1]
        # Excess: [9, 9, 0.1]
        # score_A for 0.1: logistic(30 * (0.01 - 0.1)) = logistic(-2.7) ~ 0.06
        # score_B for 0.1: logistic(-20 * 0.1) = logistic(-2.0) ~ 0.12
        # Combined: 1.0 * 0.06 + 0.5 * 0.12 = 0.06 + 0.06 = 0.12. This is low.

        # Let's flip the logistic usage:
        # Prioritize minimal residual space: favor `excess_capacity` close to 0.
        # `logistic(-steepness * excess_capacity)` -> Peaks at 0.5 for excess=0, decays.
        # Prioritize slight positive gap: favor `excess_capacity` close to `ideal_gap`.
        # `logistic(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacity))` -> Peaks at 1 for `ideal_gap`.

        # Let's adjust the structure:
        # Bin remaining capacity `c`. Item size `i`. Bin capacity `C`. `excess = c - i`.
        #
        # Heuristic:
        # 1. Try to find bins where `c - i` is small and positive (e.g., `0 < c - i < 0.1`).
        # 2. If not found, try to find bins where `c - i = 0`.
        # 3. If not found, consider other bins.

        # Score function `S(excess)`:
        # S(0) = high
        # S(small_positive) = very high (peak)
        # S(larger_positive) = medium, decreasing
        # S(very_large_positive) = low

        # Let's refine the "peak at `ideal_gap`" part.
        # `logistic(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))` gives scores that are:
        # `ideal_gap`: 1.0
        # `0`: logistic(steepness * ideal_gap) (near 1 for small ideal_gap)
        # `very large`: close to 0.
        # This doesn't quite distinguish between 0 and ideal_gap as well as we might like.

        # Let's try a different combination using sigmoids:
        # Score = `w1 * sigmoid(s1 * (ideal_gap - excess))`  # Favors excess < ideal_gap
        #       + `w2 * sigmoid(s2 * (0 - excess))`        # Favors excess == 0

        # Let's use the `priority_v1` structure but enhance it for "worst fit reduction".
        # The `priority_v1` uses `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))`.
        # This already penalizes large excesses.
        # "Worst fit reduction" in this context might mean: if there are multiple bins with similar "good fit" scores,
        # prefer the one that is "least empty" among them, or penalize those that are "most empty" among the good fits.
        #
        # Consider bins with `excess_capacity` within a certain range around `ideal_gap`.
        # Among these, pick the one with minimal `excess_capacity`.

        # Let's apply a bonus for minimal waste (excess=0) and a penalty for large waste.
        # Base priority = `logistic(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))` (peaks at ideal_gap)
        # Bonus for exact fit = `logistic(-steepness_zero * excess_capacities)` (peaks at 0)
        # Penalty for large excess = `sigmoid(steepness_penalty * (excess_capacities - penalty_threshold))`

        # Let's try a simpler approach inspired by Best Fit Decreasing (BFD) for online.
        # The "residual space" matters.
        # Consider the ratio `item_size / bin_capacity`.
        # Or `bin_remaining_cap / bin_capacity`.
        #
        # The goal is to minimize the number of bins.
        # So, we want to fill bins as much as possible.
        # This means minimizing `excess_capacity`.
        #
        # So, a priority function that decreases with `excess_capacity` is good.
        # `f(excess) = 1 / (1 + excess)`
        # `f(excess) = exp(-k * excess)`
        #
        # Let's return to the interpretation of "best fit" as minimal excess.
        # We want to prioritize bins where `excess_capacity` is smallest.
        #
        # "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space."
        # This implies:
        # 1. `excess_capacity = 0` is best.
        # 2. `excess_capacity` slightly > 0 is next best.
        # 3. `excess_capacity` larger is worse.
        #
        # This is what `logistic(-k * excess)` combined with `logistic(k * (ideal_gap - excess))` could achieve.

        # Let's define the score `S(excess)` as:
        # `S(excess) = a * logistic(-s1 * excess) + b * logistic(s2 * (ideal_gap - excess))`
        # `a` and `b` are weights, `s1` and `s2` are steepness.
        # `ideal_gap = 0.01`

        steepness_exact = 20.0
        steepness_gap = 25.0
        ideal_gap = 0.01

        # Score component for exact fit (peaks at excess=0)
        score_exact = logistic(-steepness_exact * excess_capacities)

        # Score component for slight gap (peaks at excess=ideal_gap)
        score_gap = logistic(steepness_gap * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))

        # Combine them. We want exact fit to be good, slight gap to be even better.
        # If we want `ideal_gap` to be the absolute maximum score:
        # This requires careful weighting.
        # If `excess = ideal_gap`: `score_exact` = logistic(-s1 * ideal_gap) ( < 0.5)
        #                         `score_gap` = logistic(0) = 0.5.
        # This doesn't work as intended. The logistic function with `(ideal_gap - excess)` peaks at 1.
        # The logistic function with `-steepness * excess` peaks at 0.5.

        # Let's use the `priority_v1` structure and modify it to ensure the peak is indeed at `ideal_gap`.
        # The function `f(x) = sigmoid(steepness * (center - x))` has its midpoint at `center`.
        # If we want peak priority AT `ideal_gap`, then `ideal_gap` should map to a high value.
        #
        # Let's use the original `priority_v1` concept: prioritizing bins where remaining capacity is *slightly* larger.
        # `excess_capacities = bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] - item`
        # We want to maximize a function `P(excess_capacity)`.
        # `P(0)` should be high.
        # `P(ideal_gap)` should be the highest.
        # `P(large_excess)` should be low.

        # Let's define `P(x)` as:
        # `P(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (x - ideal_gap)^2))`  -- Gaussian-like
        # This isn't directly a sigmoid.

        # Let's try to combine two sigmoids carefully.
        # 1. `sigmoid_exact = sigmoid(steepness_exact * (0 - excess_capacities))` -> Favors excess close to 0.
        # 2. `sigmoid_gap = sigmoid(steepness_gap * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))` -> Favors excess close to `ideal_gap`.
        #
        # The original `priority_v1` function IS using `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))`.
        # Let's analyze that:
        # `ideal_gap = 0.05`, `steepness = 10`.
        # `excess = 0`: `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 0)) = sigmoid(0.5) ≈ 0.62`
        # `excess = 0.05`: `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 0.05)) = sigmoid(0) = 0.5`
        # `excess = 0.1`: `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 0.1)) = sigmoid(-0.5) ≈ 0.38`
        # `excess = 0.02`: `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 0.02)) = sigmoid(0.3) ≈ 0.57`
        #
        # This function *decreases* from 0.62 at excess=0 to 0.5 at excess=0.05 and further down.
        # It does NOT peak at `ideal_gap`. It prioritizes smaller excesses, with a slight bias.

        # To peak at `ideal_gap`:
        # We need a function that is high for `ideal_gap`, and lower for `0` and `larger_excess`.
        # A "bell curve" shape.
        # `exp(-(excess - ideal_gap)^2 / sigma^2)`
        #
        # Using sigmoids to approximate a peak:
        # Priority = `sigmoid(k1 * (ideal_gap - excess)) * sigmoid(k2 * (excess - 0))`
        # This gives `sigmoid(k1*ideal_gap) * sigmoid(0)` at `excess=0`.
        # And `sigmoid(0) * sigmoid(k2 * ideal_gap)` at `excess=ideal_gap`.
        # This doesn't directly yield a peak.

        # Let's reconsider the "worst fit reduction".
        # If we have bins [10, 10, 10, 10, 10] and item = 1.
        # Excesses are all 9.
        # If we have bins [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] and item = 4.
        # Excesses are all 1.
        #
        # "Worst fit reduction": Amongst bins that are *not* best fits, pick the one with the largest remaining capacity.
        # This means that if `ideal_gap` fit is not found, and exact fit is not found, then among the remaining,
        # pick the one that is "least full". This is counter-intuitive for minimizing bins.
        #
        # Alternative interpretation: Prioritize small excesses, and if there are multiple bins with similar small excesses,
        # prefer the one that has a larger capacity (to potentially save smaller bins for smaller items later).
        #
        # Let's try to model:
        # Score = `f(excess_capacity)`
        # `f(0)` is good.
        # `f(ideal_gap)` is best.
        # `f(excess)` decreases as `excess` increases.
        #
        # Function: `1 / (1 + (excess - ideal_gap)^2)` ? Not sigmoid.
        #
        # Let's refine the sigmoid approach.
        # We want a function that:
        # - Has a maximum value.
        # - The maximum value occurs at `ideal_gap`.
        # - Values decrease as `excess_capacity` moves away from `ideal_gap` in either direction (but especially for larger positive excess).
        #
        # Let `score = sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))` for `excess <= ideal_gap`.
        # And `score = sigmoid(steepness * (excess - ideal_gap))` for `excess > ideal_gap`, but inverted.
        #
        # Consider the function: `f(x) = sigmoid(k * (ideal_gap - x))`
        # At `x = ideal_gap`, `f(ideal_gap) = sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
        # This is the center of the sigmoid.
        #
        # To get a peak AT `ideal_gap`, we need the function to be maximal there.
        #
        # Final attempt at interpretation:
        # Priority = `WeightBestFit * ScoreBestFit` + `WeightLeastWaste * ScoreLeastWaste`
        # `ScoreBestFit`: High for `excess` near `ideal_gap`.
        # `ScoreLeastWaste`: High for `excess` near `0`.
        #
        # `ScoreBestFit = logistic(steepness_ideal * (ideal_gap - excess))`
        # `ScoreLeastWaste = logistic(-steepness_zero * excess)`
        #
        # If `ideal_gap = 0.01`:
        # excess=0: SF=logistic(-s_z*0) = 0.5; SB=logistic(s_i*0.01) (near 1)
        # excess=0.01: SF=logistic(-s_z*0.01) (near 0.5); SB=logistic(0) = 0.5
        #
        # This still doesn't make `ideal_gap` the absolute peak if `s_i` is not chosen carefully relative to `s_z`.
        #
        # Let's assume "minimal residual space" is the MOST important factor.
        # This means `excess_capacity` should be as small as possible.
        #
        # Priority = `f(excess_capacity)` where `f` is decreasing.
        # `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x)`
        # `f(x) = exp(-k*x)`
        #
        # The `priority_v1` is already quite good for this. It penalizes larger excesses.
        #
        # How to incorporate "worst fit reduction"?
        # If we have bins [10, 20, 30] and item=5:
        # Excesses: [5, 15, 25].
        # Priority: `sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - excess))`
        # excess=5: sigmoid(-4.95) ~ 0
        # excess=15: sigmoid(-14.95) ~ 0
        # excess=25: sigmoid(-24.95) ~ 0
        #
        # If we have bins [5, 6, 7] and item=4:
        # Excesses: [1, 2, 3]
        # Priority:
        # excess=1: sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 1)) = sigmoid(-9.5) ~ 0
        # excess=2: sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 2)) = sigmoid(-19.5) ~ 0
        # excess=3: sigmoid(10 * (0.05 - 3)) = sigmoid(-29.5) ~ 0
        #
        # The steepness needs to be adjusted based on the expected range of `excess_capacities`.
        # If `excess_capacities` can be large, `steepness` should be adjusted or the function modified.
        #
        # Let's consider the "worst fit reduction" as a way to break ties or modify scores for less ideal fits.
        # If multiple bins have similar "good" scores, pick the one that's "least empty".
        #
        # Modified score: `priority = base_score + alpha * (bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] / MAX_CAPACITY)`
        # Where `base_score` is the sigmoid score.
        #
        # Let's try:
        # Base score: `logistic(-steepness_least_waste * excess_capacities)` -> Favors minimal waste (excess near 0)
        # Bonus for "least empty" among these: `bonus = bins_remain_cap[fits_mask]`. Normalize this.
        #
        # Final approach based on reflection:
        # 1. Prioritize exact fits (excess=0) => High score for excess=0.
        # 2. Then minimal residual space (excess near 0) => High score for small positive excess.
        # 3. Combine 'best fit' (minimal excess) with 'worst fit reduction' (prefer fuller bins among non-ideal).

        # Let's prioritize minimal excess first.
        # Score = `logistic(-steepness_minimal_waste * excess_capacities)`
        # This function peaks at 0.5 for excess=0 and decreases.
        #
        # To make it "prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space":
        # We need the value at excess=0 to be higher than for slightly positive excess.
        # But the reflection says "then minimal residual space".
        # Let's assume "exact fits" is the primary goal.
        #
        # If `excess_capacity = 0`, assign a high score.
        # If `0 < excess_capacity < threshold`, assign good scores.
        # If `excess_capacity >= threshold`, assign lower scores.
        #
        # Let's try to model this with two components, weighted.
        # Component 1: Exact fit bonus.
        #   `score_exact = 1.0` if `excess == 0`, else `0.0`. (Hard threshold)
        #   Or `score_exact = exp(-steepness_e * excess)` (Soft threshold)
        # Component 2: Minimal residual space / Best fit.
        #   `score_bestfit = logistic(steepness_bf * (ideal_gap - excess))`
        #
        # Combining them:
        # `priority = w_exact * score_exact + w_bestfit * score_bestfit`
        #
        # Let's use soft thresholds for all.
        steepness_exact_fit = 50.0 # Very steep near 0
        steepness_best_fit = 20.0
        ideal_gap = 0.02 # Small positive remainder

        # Score for exact fit (high for excess=0, drops rapidly)
        score_exact = logistic(steepness_exact_fit * (0 - excess_capacities))

        # Score for best fit (high for excess near ideal_gap, decreases)
        score_best_fit = logistic(steepness_best_fit * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))

        # Combine: Exact fit is paramount, followed by best fit.
        # Give exact fit a higher weight.
        weight_exact = 1.0
        weight_bestfit = 0.7

        # The combined score will be:
        # At excess=0: `1.0*logistic(0) + 0.7*logistic(20*0.02)` = `1.0*0.5 + 0.7*logistic(0.4)`
        #             `0.5 + 0.7 * (1 / (1 + exp(-0.4)))` = `0.5 + 0.7 * (1 / (1 + 0.67))`
        #             `0.5 + 0.7 * (1 / 1.67)` = `0.5 + 0.7 * 0.598` = `0.5 + 0.418` = 0.918
        # At excess=ideal_gap=0.02: `1.0*logistic(-50*0.02) + 0.7*logistic(0)`
        #                         `1.0*logistic(-1.0) + 0.7*0.5`
        #                         `0.268 + 0.35` = 0.618
        # This gives higher priority to exact fits.

        # "Worst fit reduction": among the "best fit" candidates, prefer fuller bins.
        # If `score_best_fit` is similar, we want to boost bins with smaller `excess_capacities`.
        # This is implicitly handled by `score_exact` and the way `score_best_fit` decays from `ideal_gap`.
        #
        # Let's add a term that specifically boosts smaller `excess_capacities` when `score_best_fit` is relevant.
        # Consider the ratio `excess_capacities / bins_remain_cap[fits_mask]`. This isn't right.
        #
        # The reflection stated: "Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'."
        # If "best fit" is minimal excess, then "worst fit reduction" might mean:
        # Among bins that are NOT best fits, prefer the one that has the largest remaining capacity.
        # This seems to imply a secondary sorting criteria or a blended score.

        # Let's use a score that prioritizes minimal excess, and then adds a bonus for larger remaining capacity among those that are similar.
        #
        # Final Score = `f(excess_capacity, remaining_capacity)`
        # Prioritize `excess_capacity` being small.
        # If `excess_capacity` values are close, boost based on `remaining_capacity` (larger is better).

        # Let `f(excess) = logistic(-steepness_minimal_waste * excess)`.
        # This gives higher scores for smaller excesses.
        # Let `g(rem_cap) = rem_cap / MAX_BIN_CAPACITY`. Add this as bonus.
        # `priority = f(excess) + bonus_weight * g(remaining_capacity)`
        #
        # Let's pick `MAX_BIN_CAPACITY` dynamically or assume a constant.

        # Let's assume max bin capacity is 1.0 for simplicity, or we need it passed in.
        # For now, we can normalize by the maximum *available* capacity, but that's unstable.
        # Let's normalize by a fixed expected max capacity if known, otherwise by a representative value.
        # Assume max capacity is 1.0 for normalization scale.

        # `priorities[fits_mask] = logistic(-steepness_minimal_waste * excess_capacities) \
        #                         + 0.3 * (bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] / 1.0)` # Normalize remaining capacity

        steepness_minimal_waste = 25.0
        bonus_weight = 0.3
        assumed_max_capacity = 1.0 # Normalize remaining capacity by this value.

        # Minimal waste score
        score_minimal_waste = logistic(-steepness_minimal_waste * excess_capacities)

        # Worst fit bonus (prefer fuller bins among those with similar minimal waste scores)
        # If excess is small, remaining capacity is also small (close to item size).
        # If remaining capacity is larger, it's less "wasteful" among options with small excess.
        # This is confusing. "Worst fit reduction" implies penalizing large capacities.
        #
        # Let's assume the reflection means:
        # 1. Prioritize bins where `excess_capacity` is minimal.
        # 2. If there's a tie in minimal excess, pick the bin with largest `remaining_capacity`.
        #
        # This can be achieved by sorting by `(excess_capacity, -remaining_capacity)`.
        # Our priority function should reflect this ordering.
        #
        # Let the score be dominated by `excess_capacity`.
        # Use `1 / (1 + excess_capacity)` as a base.
        # Then add a bonus for larger remaining capacity.
        #
        # Base score based on minimal waste:
        # `base_score = 1 / (1 + excess_capacities)`
        # Bonus for fuller bins:
        # `bonus = bins_remain_cap[fits_mask]`
        # Normalize bonus: `bonus_normalized = bonus / np.max(bonus)` (careful if only one bin)
        # A fixed `MAX_CAPACITY` is better.

        # Let's use the logistic function for minimal waste, and add the bonus.
        # Minimal waste score: `logistic(-steepness * excess)`
        # Bonus: Normalize remaining capacity. Higher is better.
        # We want to penalize large remaining capacity for the "reduction" part.
        #
        # So, prioritize small excess, AND penalize large remaining capacity.
        # This implies `excess` is the primary factor, and `remaining_capacity` is secondary,
        # where higher `remaining_capacity` leads to LOWER priority (if we interpret "reduction" as penalty).

        # Let's try to directly fulfill the interpretation:
        # "Prioritize exact fits, then minimal residual space."
        # => Maximize `f(excess)` where `f(0)` is highest, and `f(x)` decreases for `x > 0`.
        #
        # "Combine 'best fit' (minimal excess) with 'worst fit reduction'."
        # If "worst fit reduction" means preferring fuller bins among equally-good fits.
        #
        # Let's take the minimal waste score `logistic(-steepness * excess_capacity)`.
        # This handles minimal waste well.
        # How to add "worst fit reduction" meaning "prefer fuller bins"?
        # It means, if two bins have similar small `excess_capacity`, pick the one that is "less empty".
        # This means picking the bin with the largest `remaining_capacity`.
        #
        # So, a score that uses `excess_capacity` as primary and `remaining_capacity` as secondary (descending).
        # `score = Base(excess_capacity) + bonus(remaining_capacity)`
        #
        # `Base(excess) = logistic(-steepness * excess)`
        # `bonus(rem_cap) = weight * (rem_cap / MAX_CAP)`
        # This boosts bins with larger remaining capacity.
        #
        # `excess = rem_cap - item`. So `rem_cap = excess + item`.
        # Maximizing `rem_cap` is equivalent to maximizing `excess` (if item is constant).
        # This contradicts minimal waste.

        # Re-reading again: "Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction'".
        # This often means:
        # - Best Fit: minimal `excess_capacity`.
        # - Worst Fit: maximal `remaining_capacity`.
        # - Reduction: Avoid the *worst* aspect of worst fit. The worst aspect is having large `remaining_capacity`.
        #   So, if we *must* pick a bin that is not a "best fit", we should avoid picking one with *extremely* large `remaining_capacity`.
        #   This implies that among non-best-fit bins, we prefer those with smaller `remaining_capacity` (i.e., less empty).

        # So, prioritize:
        # 1. Minimal `excess_capacity` (best fit).
        # 2. Among bins with similar minimal `excess_capacity`, prefer smaller `remaining_capacity`.
        # This is effectively prioritizing minimal `excess_capacity`.

        # Let's implement the minimal waste priority with a bonus for NOT being overly empty.
        # `excess_capacity` is primary.
        # `remaining_capacity` is secondary for tie-breaking or small adjustments.
        #
        # `priority_score = logistic(-steepness * excess_capacity)`
        #
        # If two bins have very similar `excess_capacity` (e.g., 0.01 and 0.011), the logistic function will give similar scores.
        # To break ties or differentiate slightly: add a term based on `remaining_capacity`.
        # If we want to prefer bins that are "less empty" among these, we would add a term that increases with `remaining_capacity`.
        # BUT, this contradicts the goal of minimal residual space.

        # Let's stick to the idea of prioritizing minimal excess, and if "worst fit reduction" means
        # "don't leave *too much* empty space if a better option exists", then our decaying function is sufficient.
        # The key is that the score should be high for small `excess_capacity`.

        # Using `priority_v1` function's core idea:
        # `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess))`
        # This prioritizes bins where `excess_capacity < ideal_gap`.
        # It decays for larger excesses.
        # Let's make `ideal_gap` smaller and steepness higher.
        #
        # `ideal_gap = 0.01`
        # `steepness = 25`
        # `priority = sigmoid(25 * (0.01 - excess))`
        #
        # excess=0: sigmoid(25*0.01) = sigmoid(0.25) = 0.56
        # excess=0.01: sigmoid(0) = 0.5
        # excess=0.02: sigmoid(25*(-0.01)) = sigmoid(-0.25) = 0.44
        #
        # This prioritizes smaller excesses, but not strictly minimal excess.
        # It also doesn't guarantee a peak at `ideal_gap`.

        # Let's try the combination:
        # Score = `w1 * logistic(-s1 * excess)` (favors minimal waste)
        #       + `w2 * logistic(s2 * (ideal_gap - excess))` (favors slight gap)

        steepness_min_waste = 20.0
        steepness_slight_gap = 25.0
        ideal_gap_val = 0.01

        score_min_waste = logistic(-steepness_min_waste * excess_capacities)
        score_slight_gap = logistic(steepness_slight_gap * (ideal_gap_val - excess_capacities))

        # Combine them, perhaps giving more weight to minimal waste.
        weight_min_waste = 1.0
        weight_slight_gap = 0.6

        # Final score calculation
        priorities[fits_mask] = weight_min_waste * score_min_waste + weight_slight_gap * score_slight_gap

        # What about "worst fit reduction"?
        # If `excess_capacities` is large, scores will be low.
        # The `score_slight_gap` will be low. The `score_min_waste` will be low.
        # This inherently reduces priority for bins with large excess.
        #
        # Let's add a small penalty for very large remaining capacities IF they are not "best fits".
        # This is tricky to implement cleanly with a single score.
        # The current combined score already penalizes large excesses.
        #
        # Let's consider the "worst fit reduction" as a modifier to the score.
        # If a bin has a large `excess_capacity`, we might want to reduce its score further.
        # The current score already does this.
        #
        # Let's assume "worst fit reduction" in context of "best fit" means:
        # Among bins that are *not* best fits (i.e., `excess_capacity` > `ideal_gap`), pick the one that's least wasteful (smallest `excess_capacity`).
        # And if they are equal, pick the one with larger `remaining_capacity`.
        #
        # The current combined score:
        # At excess=0: `1.0*logistic(0) + 0.6*logistic(25*0.01)` = `0.5 + 0.6*logistic(0.25)` = `0.5 + 0.6*0.56` = `0.5 + 0.336` = 0.836
        # At excess=0.01: `1.0*logistic(-20*0.01) + 0.6*logistic(0)` = `1.0*logistic(-0.2) + 0.6*0.5` = `0.452 + 0.3` = 0.752
        # At excess=0.02: `1.0*logistic(-20*0.02) + 0.6*logistic(25*(-0.01))` = `1.0*logistic(-0.4) + 0.6*logistic(-0.25)`
        #              `0.401 + 0.6*0.44 = 0.401 + 0.264` = 0.665
        #
        # This combination prioritizes minimal waste (excess=0) and then slightly prefers the ideal gap.
        # The scores decrease as `excess_capacity` increases.
        # This seems to capture the main goals.
