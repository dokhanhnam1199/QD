System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Epsilon-Greedy.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """

    if len(valid_bins_indices) == 0:
        # No bin can fit the item, return all zeros (or handle appropriately)
        return np.zeros(num_bins)

    # Greedy part: prioritize bins that leave the least remaining capacity
    # This is the "best fit" heuristic within the greedy selection.
    greedy_scores = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins_indices] - item

    # Apply epsilon-greedy strategy
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        # Exploration: randomly choose one of the valid bins

        priorities[best_fit_global_index] = 1.0 # Assign highest priority to the best fit bin

    # For bins that *can* fit the item but are not chosen by epsilon-greedy,
    # we can assign a small non-zero priority to still allow them a chance,
    # or simply keep them at zero if we only want one bin to have the highest score.
    # For simplicity here, we only give priority to the chosen bin.

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Exact Fit First.

    Exact Fit First prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item perfectly,
    meaning the remaining capacity of the bin after placing the item is zero.
    Among bins that offer an exact fit, we can further refine the priority.
    Here, we'll prioritize bins that have a smaller remaining capacity *before*
    fitting the item (but still large enough to fit it). This strategy
    aims to "fill up" bins more effectively with exact fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    exact_fit_mask = (bins_remain_cap - item) == 0

    # For bins that allow an exact fit, assign a high priority based on their
    # *current* remaining capacity. We want bins that are *almost* full
    # (but can still fit the item exactly) to be prioritized.
    # We can achieve this by assigning a priority score that is inversely
    # related to their current remaining capacity, or by assigning a score
    # that increases as remaining capacity decreases towards the item size.
    # A simple approach is to assign a large base score and then add
    # a bonus related to how close their current capacity is to the item size.
    # Let's use a base high priority for exact fits and add a term that
    # rewards smaller remaining capacities.

    # A large base priority to favor exact fits
    base_exact_fit_priority = 1000.0

    # Calculate priority for exact fit bins: higher score for bins that were
    # closer to exactly fitting the item (i.e., smaller current remaining_cap).
    # We add a small value related to (bins_remain_cap - item) to ensure
    # that among exact fits, those with smaller initial capacity get a slight edge.
    # Since for exact fits, bins_remain_cap - item is 0, this term is effectively 0.
    # Let's consider a slightly different approach: prioritize exact fits,
    # and among those, pick the one that leaves the smallest remaining space
    # if we consider the *exact* remaining space after fitting.
    # So, if bins_remain_cap[i] == item, then bins_remain_cap[i] - item is 0.
    # To favor those closer to the item size, we can use something like
    # 1 / (epsilon + bins_remain_cap[i]) or a similar inverse relationship.
    # A simpler heuristic for exact fit is to give a high score to those
    # where bins_remain_cap == item. We can then add a penalty for
    # bins that would have excess capacity even with an exact fit.

    # Let's refine the exact fit priority:
    # Assign a very high priority to bins that can fit the item perfectly.
    # To break ties among exact fits, we can prioritize the bin that currently
    # has the least remaining capacity (closest to the item size without being smaller).
    # If bins_remain_cap[i] == item, then bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0.
    # We want higher priority for smaller `bins_remain_cap` among exact fits.
    # So, `1 / bins_remain_cap[i]` would work, but we need to avoid division by zero
    # if bin capacity could be 0, or if the item size is 0.
    # Assuming item > 0 and bin capacities are positive.
    # A safer approach might be to use the difference `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # For exact fits, this is 0. For non-exact fits, it's > 0.
    # We can assign a score that is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity
    # *after* fitting the item, for those bins that have an exact fit.

    # Assign a high score to bins that can fit the item exactly.
    # Among those, give preference to the bin with the smallest remaining capacity *after* fitting.
    # This means prioritizing bins where `bins_remain_cap[i]` is closest to `item`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`, the remaining capacity after fit is 0.
    # We can use `1 / (item + epsilon)` for exact fits.

    # Let's create a priority based on:
    # 1. A large bonus for exact fits.
    # 2. Among exact fits, a smaller value for `bins_remain_cap[i]` gets a higher score.

    # For bins that fit the item (i.e., bins_remain_cap >= item):
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    fittable_capacities = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]
    fittable_indices = np.where(can_fit_mask)[0]

    # Calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item.
    remaining_after_fit = fittable_capacities - item

    # Priority for fittable bins:
    # We want to prioritize bins that result in *zero* remaining capacity (exact fits).
    # For non-exact fits, we want to prioritize bins that result in *less* remaining capacity.
    # A common heuristic is to sort by remaining capacity after fitting.
    # The "Exact Fit" strategy specifically looks for `remaining_after_fit == 0`.

    # Let's implement a strict Exact Fit First:
    # Highest priority to bins where `bins_remain_cap == item`.
    # For these, the remaining capacity after fitting is 0.
    # To break ties among exact fits, we can pick the one with the smallest initial capacity.
    # Or, we can simply assign them all a high uniform priority and then potentially
    # use a secondary criterion if needed, but the prompt implies a single priority score.

    # Strategy:
    # 1. Bins with `bins_remain_cap == item` get a very high priority.
    # 2. Bins with `bins_remain_cap > item` (but not exact fit) get a lower priority.
    # 3. Bins with `bins_remain_cap < item` get zero priority (cannot fit).

    # Assigning priority:
    # Use a large multiplier for exact fits.
    # For bins that are not exact fits but can fit the item, we can assign a score
    # that decreases as their remaining capacity (after fitting) increases.
    # The smaller the `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` for non-exact fits, the higher the priority.
    # This makes it a "Best Fit" if no exact fit exists.

    # A high score for exact fits
    exact_fit_bonus = 100.0

    # For bins that fit, calculate a score that is higher for those with smaller remaining capacity *after* fitting.
    # We can use a large negative number for non-fitting bins to ensure they are least prioritized.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = -remaining_after_fit # Higher score for smaller remaining capacity

    # Now, adjust for exact fits. We want exact fits to be *higher* than any non-exact fit.
    # If `remaining_after_fit` is 0, we want a score that is > any negative number.
    # Let's assign a fixed high score to exact fits.
    # The indices where exact fit happens are `fittable_indices[remaining_after_fit == 0]`.
    exact_fit_indices = fittable_indices[remaining_after_fit == 0]

    # For exact fits, set a very high priority. If there are multiple exact fits,
    # their scores here would be the same. If a secondary criterion is needed,
    # it could be incorporated into this score, e.g., `-bins_remain_cap[exact_fit_indices]`.
    # For this implementation, let's assign a high base priority to all exact fits.
    priorities[exact_fit_indices] = exact_fit_bonus

    # For bins that can fit but are not exact fits, their priority is `-remaining_after_fit`.
    # Since `remaining_after_fit` is positive, these scores will be negative.
    # The largest negative score (closest to zero) will be for the smallest `remaining_after_fit`.

    # Final priority adjustment:
    # If an exact fit exists, all exact fits should have the highest priority.
    # Among exact fits, let's favor those that were closer to the item size initially.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`, its score is `exact_fit_bonus`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] > item`, its score is `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.

    # To ensure exact fits are strictly preferred over best-fit (among non-exact fits):
    # We can scale the exact fit bonus to be significantly larger than the
    # maximum possible score from the best-fit part.
    # The best-fit scores range from approximately -(BIN_CAPACITY - ITEM_SIZE) to slightly less than 0.
    # So, `exact_fit_bonus` should be greater than `BIN_CAPACITY`.
    # Let's use `np.max(bins_remain_cap)` as a safe upper bound for remaining capacity.

    scaled_priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    max_possible_best_fit_score = -np.min(remaining_after_fit) if len(remaining_after_fit) > 0 else 0
    exact_fit_priority_value = exact_fit_bonus # or something larger like 2 * np.max(bins_remain_cap) if we know capacity limits

    # Apply priorities:
    # Exact fits get the highest priority
    exact_fit_locations = (bins_remain_cap - item) == 0
    scaled_priorities[exact_fit_locations] = exact_fit_priority_value

    # For bins that can fit but not exactly, assign a priority based on minimizing
    # the remaining space. The smaller the remaining space, the higher the priority.
    # Since `remaining_after_fit` is always >= 0, and we want higher priority for smaller values,
    # a negative sign and then the value works for sorting.
    # For example, if item=3 and capacities are 7, 8, 10:
    # Remaining after fit: 4, 5, 7.
    # Scores: -4, -5, -7. Higher score is -4 (bin with capacity 7).
    # This would mean it's a "Best Fit" strategy.

    # To ensure Exact Fit First:
    # Set exact fits to a high constant value.
    # Set non-exact fits to a lower range of values.

    # a bonus related to how close their current capacity is to the item size.
    # Let's use a base high priority for exact fits and add a term that
    # rewards smaller remaining capacities.

    # A large base priority to favor exact fits
    base_exact_fit_priority = 1000.0

    # Calculate priority for exact fit bins: higher score for bins that were
    # closer to exactly fitting the item (i.e., smaller current remaining_cap).
    # We add a small value related to (bins_remain_cap - item) to ensure
    # that among exact fits, those with smaller initial capacity get a slight edge.
    # Since for exact fits, bins_remain_cap - item is 0, this term is effectively 0.
    # Let's consider a slightly different approach: prioritize exact fits,
    # and among those, pick the one that leaves the smallest remaining space
    # if we consider the *exact* remaining space after fitting.
    # So, if bins_remain_cap[i] == item, then bins_remain_cap[i] - item is 0.
    # To favor those closer to the item size, we can use something like
    # 1 / (epsilon + bins_remain_cap[i]) or a similar inverse relationship.
    # A simpler heuristic for exact fit is to give a high score to those
    # where bins_remain_cap == item. We can then add a penalty for
    # bins that would have excess capacity even with an exact fit.

    # Let's refine the exact fit priority:
    # Assign a very high priority to bins that can fit the item perfectly.
    # To break ties among exact fits, we can prioritize the bin that currently
    # has the least remaining capacity (closest to the item size without being smaller).
    # If bins_remain_cap[i] == item, then bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0.
    # We want higher priority for smaller `bins_remain_cap` among exact fits.
    # So, `1 / bins_remain_cap[i]` would work, but we need to avoid division by zero
    # if bin capacity could be 0, or if the item size is 0.
    # Assuming item > 0 and bin capacities are positive.
    # A safer approach might be to use the difference `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # For exact fits, this is 0. For non-exact fits, it's > 0.
    # We can assign a score that is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity
    # *after* fitting the item, for those bins that have an exact fit.

    # Assign a high score to bins that can fit the item exactly.
    # Among those, give preference to the bin with the smallest remaining capacity *after* fitting.
    # This means prioritizing bins where `bins_remain_cap[i]` is closest to `item`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`, the remaining capacity after fit is 0.
    # We can use `1 / (item + epsilon)` for exact fits.

    # Let's create a priority based on:
    # 1. A large bonus for exact fits.
    # 2. Among exact fits, a smaller value for `bins_remain_cap[i]` gets a higher score.

    # For bins that fit the item (i.e., bins_remain_cap >= item):
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    fittable_capacities = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]
    fittable_indices = np.where(can_fit_mask)[0]

    # Calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item.
    remaining_after_fit = fittable_capacities - item

    # Priority for fittable bins:
    # We want to prioritize bins that result in *zero* remaining capacity (exact fits).
    # For non-exact fits, we want to prioritize bins that result in *less* remaining capacity.
    # A common heuristic is to sort by remaining capacity after fitting.
    # The "Exact Fit" strategy specifically looks for `remaining_after_fit == 0`.

    # Let's implement a strict Exact Fit First:
    # Highest priority to bins where `bins_remain_cap == item`.
    # For these, the remaining capacity after fitting is 0.
    # To break ties among exact fits, we can pick the one with the smallest initial capacity.
    # Or, we can simply assign them all a high uniform priority and then potentially
    # use a secondary criterion if needed, but the prompt implies a single priority score.

    # Strategy:
    # 1. Bins with `bins_remain_cap == item` get a very high priority.
    # 2. Bins with `bins_remain_cap > item` (but not exact fit) get a lower priority.
    # 3. Bins with `bins_remain_cap < item` get zero priority (cannot fit).

    # Assigning priority:
    # Use a large multiplier for exact fits.
    # For bins that are not exact fits but can fit the item, we can assign a score
    # that decreases as their remaining capacity (after fitting) increases.
    # The smaller the `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` for non-exact fits, the higher the priority.
    # This makes it a "Best Fit" if no exact fit exists.

    # A high score for exact fits
    exact_fit_bonus = 100.0

    # For bins that fit, calculate a score that is higher for those with smaller remaining capacity *after* fitting.
    # We can use a large negative number for non-fitting bins to ensure they are least prioritized.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = -remaining_after_fit # Higher score for smaller remaining capacity

    # Now, adjust for exact fits. We want exact fits to be *higher* than any non-exact fit.
    # If `remaining_after_fit` is 0, we want a score that is > any negative number.
    # Let's assign a fixed high score to exact fits.
    # The indices where exact fit happens are `fittable_indices[remaining_after_fit == 0]`.
    exact_fit_indices = fittable_indices[remaining_after_fit == 0]

    # For exact fits, set a very high priority. If there are multiple exact fits,
    # their scores here would be the same. If a secondary criterion is needed,
    # it could be incorporated into this score, e.g., `-bins_remain_cap[exact_fit_indices]`.
    # For this implementation, let's assign a high base priority to all exact fits.
    priorities[exact_fit_indices] = exact_fit_bonus

    # For bins that can fit but are not exact fits, their priority is `-remaining_after_fit`.
    # Since `remaining_after_fit` is positive, these scores will be negative.
    # The largest negative score (closest to zero) will be for the smallest `remaining_after_fit`.

    # Final priority adjustment:
    # If an exact fit exists, all exact fits should have the highest priority.
    # Among exact fits, let's favor those that were closer to the item size initially.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`, its score is `exact_fit_bonus`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] > item`, its score is `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.

    # To ensure exact fits are strictly preferred over best-fit (among non-exact fits):
    # We can scale the exact fit bonus to be significantly larger than the
    # maximum possible score from the best-fit part.
    # The best-fit scores range from approximately -(BIN_CAPACITY - ITEM_SIZE) to slightly less than 0.
    # So, `exact_fit_bonus` should be greater than `BIN_CAPACITY`.
    # Let's use `np.max(bins_remain_cap)` as a safe upper bound for remaining capacity.

    scaled_priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    max_possible_best_fit_score = -np.min(remaining_after_fit) if len(remaining_after_fit) > 0 else 0
    exact_fit_priority_value = exact_fit_bonus # or something larger like 2 * np.max(bins_remain_cap) if we know capacity limits

    # Apply priorities:
    # Exact fits get the highest priority
    exact_fit_locations = (bins_remain_cap - item) == 0
    scaled_priorities[exact_fit_locations] = exact_fit_priority_value

    # For bins that can fit but not exactly, assign a priority based on minimizing
    # the remaining space. The smaller the remaining space, the higher the priority.
    # Since `remaining_after_fit` is always >= 0, and we want higher priority for smaller values,
    # a negative sign and then the value works for sorting.
    # For example, if item=3 and capacities are 7, 8, 10:
    # Remaining after fit: 4, 5, 7.
    # Scores: -4, -5, -7. Higher score is -4 (bin with capacity 7).
    # This would mean it's a "Best Fit" strategy.

    # To ensure Exact Fit First:
    # Set exact fits to a high constant value.
    # Set non-exact fits to a lower range of values.
    # The best fit criterion can be used to order within non-exact fits.

    # Let's assign a score that is simply `exact_fit_priority_value` for exact fits.
    # For bins that fit but not exactly, we want them to be strictly lower priority.
    # We can assign them a priority based on the *negative* of their remaining capacity.
    # The smaller the remaining capacity, the higher (less negative) the score.

    # Initialize all to a very low priority (unusable bins)
    scaled_priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

    # If we simply assign the same high score to all exact fits, then it becomes
    # a matter of which one is encountered first.
    # A common tie-breaker is the bin with the minimum remaining capacity before fitting,

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize exact fits, then best fit. Explore varied tie-breakers and exploration strategies.
Prioritize bins minimizing residual space for better packing efficiency.
Better heuristics prioritize tighter fits, directly mapping to smaller remaining capacities.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity for better fits.
Exploitation is generally more effective than epsilon-greedy for this problem.
Prioritize precise fits; penalize non-fits heavily. Explore sigmoid parameters.
Prioritize small positive gaps; use a tunable, robust sigmoid function.
Prioritize bins that lead to tighter packing; explore diverse fit strategies beyond simple epsilon-greedy.
1.  **Prioritize tight fits:** Favor bins with minimal remaining space after packing.
2.  **Normalize scores:** Use softmax for relative probabilities or bounded scores.
Prioritize good fits, balance exploration/exploitation, and ensure non-fits are penalized.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Prioritize tight fits with a tunable sigmoid, focusing on minimal residual space. For tie-breaking, explore varied exploration strategies beyond simple epsilon-greedy, and consider softmax for score normalization.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a refined Sigmoid Fit Score.

    This heuristic aims to prioritize bins that offer the "best fit" for the item.
    A "best fit" is defined as a bin where the remaining capacity is only slightly
    larger than the item's size. This strategy tries to fill bins as much as possible
    without leaving excessive empty space, thereby minimizing fragmentation.

    The priority is calculated using a sigmoid function. The function is designed
    to peak when the remaining capacity (`bins_remain_cap`) is precisely equal to
    the item's size, and the priority decreases as the remaining capacity deviates
    (either smaller or larger). However, bins where the item doesn't fit at all
    are assigned a zero priority.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array where each element is the remaining capacity of a bin.

    Returns:
        A numpy array of the same size as `bins_remain_cap`, containing the priority
        score for each bin. Higher scores indicate a more desirable bin for the item.
    """

    def sigmoid(x, steepness=10.0, center=0.0):
        """A custom sigmoid function that can be shifted and scaled."""
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-steepness * (x - center)))

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins where the item can fit.
    # The condition is that the bin's remaining capacity must be greater than or equal to the item's size.
    fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For bins where the item fits, calculate the 'fit difference'.
    # This is the excess capacity after placing the item.
    # We want to prioritize bins where this difference is small and non-negative.
    if np.any(fits_mask):
        # Calculate the excess capacity for fitting bins.
        excess_capacities = bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] - item

        # The sigmoid function is used to map these excess capacities to priority scores.
        # We want the highest priority (e.g., close to 1) when excess_capacity is minimal.
        # A common formulation for "good fit" prioritizes `excess_capacity` close to 0.
        # To achieve this with a sigmoid, we can use a function that decreases as `excess_capacity` increases.
        # `sigmoid(k * (ideal_excess - actual_excess))` works well here.
        # Let `ideal_excess` be 0.
        # The argument becomes `steepness * (0 - excess_capacities)` which is `-steepness * excess_capacities`.
        # This means scores will decrease from 0.5 as `excess_capacities` increases.
        #
        # To align with "slightly larger" being the peak priority (as per problem description interpretation),
        # we can shift the sigmoid. Let's define the peak priority (score=0.5) at `ideal_gap` (a small positive value).
        #
        # The function `sigmoid(steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities))` will have its midpoint at `excess_capacities = ideal_gap`.
        # With `steepness=10.0` and `ideal_gap=0.05`, the peak priority of 0.5 occurs when `bins_remain_cap - item = 0.05`.
        # Values of `excess_capacities` smaller than `ideal_gap` (but >= 0) will yield scores > 0.5.
        # Values of `excess_capacities` larger than `ideal_gap` will yield scores < 0.5.

        ideal_gap = 0.05  # Prefer bins with a small positive remaining capacity after fitting the item.
        steepness = 10.0  # Controls how sharply the priority drops as excess capacity increases.

        # Calculate the argument for the sigmoid function.
        # We want the peak of the sigmoid (where the argument is 0) to align with our 'ideal_gap'.
        # `argument = steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities)`
        argument_values = steepness * (ideal_gap - excess_capacities)

        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the priority scores for fitting bins.
        priorities[fits_mask] = sigmoid(argument_values, steepness=steepness, center=0.0)

    # For bins where the item does not fit (fits_mask is False), the priority remains 0,
    # ensuring they are not selected unless no fitting bins exist.

    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a refined Sigmoid Fit Score.

    This heuristic aims to prioritize bins that offer the "best fit" for the item.
    A "best fit" is defined as a bin where the remaining capacity is only slightly
    larger than the item's size. This strategy tries to fill bins as much as possible
    without leaving excessive empty space, thereby minimizing fragmentation.

    The priority is calculated using a sigmoid function. The function is designed
    to peak when the remaining capacity (`bins_remain_cap`) is precisely equal to
    the item's size, and the priority decreases as the remaining capacity deviates
    (either smaller or larger). However, bins where the item doesn't fit at all
    are assigned a zero priority.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array where each element is the remaining capacity of a bin.

    Returns:
        A numpy array of the same size as `bins_remain_cap`, containing the priority
        score for each bin. Higher scores indicate a more desirable bin for the item.

    # The condition is that the bin's remaining capacity must be greater than or equal to the item's size.
    fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For bins where the item fits, calculate the 'fit difference'.
    # This is the excess capacity after placing the item.
    # We want to prioritize bins where this difference is small and non-negative.

        # We want the highest priority (e.g., close to 1) when excess_capacity is minimal.
        # A common formulation for "good fit" prioritizes `excess_capacity` close to 0.
        # To achieve this with a sigmoid, we can use a function that decreases as `excess_capacity` increases.
        # `sigmoid(k * (ideal_excess - actual_excess))` works well here.

        # This means scores will decrease from 0.5 as `excess_capacities` increases.
        #
        # To align with "slightly larger" being the peak priority (as per problem description interpretation),

        # Values of `excess_capacities` smaller than `ideal_gap` (but >= 0) will yield scores > 0.5.
        # Values of `excess_capacities` larger than `ideal_gap` will yield scores < 0.5.
