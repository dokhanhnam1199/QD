Prioritize exact fits, then best fit. Explore varied tie-breakers and exploration strategies.
Prioritize bins minimizing residual space for better packing efficiency.
Better heuristics prioritize tighter fits, directly mapping to smaller remaining capacities.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity for better fits.
Exploitation is generally more effective than epsilon-greedy for this problem.
Prioritize precise fits; penalize non-fits heavily. Explore sigmoid parameters.
Prioritize small positive gaps; use a tunable, robust sigmoid function.
Prioritize bins that lead to tighter packing; explore diverse fit strategies beyond simple epsilon-greedy.
1.  **Prioritize tight fits:** Favor bins with minimal remaining space after packing.
2.  **Normalize scores:** Use softmax for relative probabilities or bounded scores.
Prioritize good fits, balance exploration/exploitation, and ensure non-fits are penalized.
