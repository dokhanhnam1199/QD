Prioritize precise fits; penalize non-fits heavily. Test heuristic intuition.
Focus on a clear objective for each heuristic. Prioritize bins that minimize waste.
Prioritize exact fits. For others, minimize remaining space after packing.
Focus on directly optimizing for "best fit" rather than complex probabilistic shaping.
Prioritize smaller remaining capacity for better fit.
Combine 'best fit' with 'worst fit reduction' for better online bin packing.
Prioritize bins with minimal, non-negative excess capacity using a smoothed function like sigmoid.
Prioritize bins with minimal positive slack. Consider scaled inverse slack or sigmoid on slack.
*   **Prioritize "tight fits":** Reward bins with minimal leftover space.
*   **Explore good options:** Use softmax for probabilistic selection among good bins.
Balance exploitation (good fits) with exploration (randomness) for better performance.
