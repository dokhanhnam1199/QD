Combining multiple heuristics (First Fit, Best Fit, Capacity Utilization) and handling edge cases improves performance.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, and consider capacity utilization and post-fill ratio. Avoid perfect fits and full bins.

The better code uses multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) with adjustments and penalties for improved performance.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, wasted space, utilization, and avoidance of full bins for improved packing.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, capacity utilization, and fragmentation avoidance improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility, waste minimization, capacity utilization, and fragmentation avoidance are crucial for bin packing heuristics.

The better code prioritizes eligibility, waste minimization (best-fit), capacity utilization, and avoids full bins, unlike log ratios.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, minimizes waste, balances utilization, and avoids fragmentation/full bins.

The better code combines multiple bin-packing heuristics for improved performance, including penalties and small adjustments.

The better code uses feasibility checks, waste minimization, and capacity utilization for improved bin packing.
