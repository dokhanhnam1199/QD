Incorporate eligibility, wasted space, capacity utilization, and avoid full bins for better performance.

Combining multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) and handling edge cases improves performance.

Consider eligibility, waste minimization, and capacity utilization for better bin selection.

Combine multiple heuristics: eligibility, waste minimization, capacity utilization. Prioritize eligible bins and avoid full bins.

Combining multiple heuristics (First Fit, Best Fit, Capacity Utilization) and handling edge cases improves performance.

Combine multiple bin packing heuristics (First Fit, Best Fit, Capacity Utilization), and penalize full bins.

Combining multiple heuristics (first-fit, best-fit, capacity utilization) and handling edge cases improves performance.
