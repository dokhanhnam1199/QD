The better code incorporates feasibility, best-fit, utilization, fragmentation avoidance, and discourages perfect fills strategically.

The better code uses inverse waste, perfect fit bonus, and capacity ratio for improved bin utilization.

The better code uses inverse waste, perfect fit bonus, and dynamic capacity adjustment for improved performance.

Combining multiple heuristics (first-fit, best-fit, capacity utilization) and handling edge cases improves performance.

The better code combines multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) with nuanced adjustments, outperforming a simple ratio-based approach.

Better code: More aggressive best-fit, perfect-fit bonuses, and dynamic capacity adjustments improve performance.

The better code uses feasibility checks, waste minimization, utilization maximization, perfect fill bonus, and dynamic adjustment.

The better code uses more effective scaling, prioritizes perfect fits, and dynamically adjusts based on average capacity.

Incorporate utilization, minimize waste with reciprocal, reward perfect fits, and dynamically adjust based on average capacity.

Incorporate multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization), prioritize eligible bins, and avoid full bins.
