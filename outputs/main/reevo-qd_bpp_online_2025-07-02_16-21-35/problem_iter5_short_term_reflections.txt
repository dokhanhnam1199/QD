Combining multiple, complementary heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) boosts performance.

Combining multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) with eligibility checks improves performance.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, wasted space, and capacity utilization, guiding the search effectively.

The better code uses eligibility, waste minimization, and capacity utilization for improved bin selection.

Combine multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) with carefully tuned priorities and constraints.

Prioritize fit, minimize waste, utilize capacity, and penalize perfect fills. Avoid invalid bins.

The better code uses eligibility, waste minimization, and capacity utilization, penalizing full bins.

Prioritize eligibility, minimize waste, and consider capacity utilization. Avoid full bins, invalidating previously full ones.

Combining multiple heuristics (first fit, best fit, capacity utilization) and handling edge cases improves performance.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, and maximize utilization while avoiding full bins. Consider post-fill ratios.
