Feasibility checks, waste minimization, capacity utilization, and fragmentation avoidance are key to improved heuristics.

Feasibility, waste, utilization, and post-fill ratio are key. Add scaling, avoid full bins, and discourage perfect fills.

The better code uses eligibility, waste minimization, capacity utilization, and penalty for full bins.

Consider feasibility, waste, utilization, and fragmentation. Dynamically adjust priorities based on remaining capacity.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, and consider capacity utilization and fragmentation avoidance.

Combining eligibility, waste minimization, and capacity utilization yields better online bin packing heuristics.

The better code uses a combination of heuristics (First Fit, Best Fit, Capacity Utilization) with adjustments and penalties.

The better code uses staged priorities: eligibility, waste, utilization, and avoiding full bins to guide bin selection.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, utilize capacity, avoid fragmentation and perfect fills.

The better code prioritizes eligibility, wasted space, and capacity utilization for improved bin packing.
