{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDynamic adjustment of weights and thresholds improves heuristic adaptability, while keeping the code simple enhances efficiency and maintainability.\nAdvanced heuristics using adaptive learning, balanced penalties, and sigmoid functions significantly outperform simpler strategies, ensuring better bin packing efficiency.\n\nIncorporate adaptive learning, dynamic adjustments, and refined balance factor calculations for better heuristic design. Avoid static coefficients and duplicate techniques without enhancement.\"\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign better heuristics by focusing on balancing factors that both encourage suitable bin placement and penalize inefficiencies like excessive leftover space. Avoid overly complex transformations or random elements that do not contribute to improvement.\n\nParameter tuning plays a critical role in heuristic performance. Optimization of thresholds and weights, based on domain-specific data, can significantly enhance heuristic efficiency. Identifying tighter thresholds and adapting weights dynamically can lead to better heuristics for bin packing.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
