The best also includes a more refined balance factor and dynamic thresholds. Comparing the second best vs the second worst, we observe that the second best also utilizes adaptive weights and a refined balance factor, unlike the second worst, which uses static weights and less nuanced balance considerations. In comparing the first vs second, we see minor improvements with the first in terms of dynamic weighting and refined thresholds, but both are strong candidates. Comparing the third vs fourth, we see a simplification in the fourth where weights are dynamically adjusted similarly but with less refined penalties. Comparing the second worst vs the worst, we see minimal differences in terms of adaptiveness and threshold usage. Overall: The best heuristic demonstrates superior adaptability and refinement in balance factors, making it significantly more effective in dynamic environments.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive learning, dynamic weights, threshold optimization, domain-specific data\n- **Advice**: Continuously calibrate weights and thresholds based on domain-specific data to optimize performance. Implement adaptive learning to refine balance factors over iterations.\n- **Avoid**: Overly complex algorithms, static parameters, random adjustments, and generic approaches.\n- **Explanation**: By focusing on dynamic and adaptive mechanisms grounded in specific domain data, the heuristic can become more responsive and efficient. This avoids the pitfalls of one-size-fits-all solutions and the inefficiencies caused by static parameters or random transformations.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
