**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st, 3rd, 6th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 16th, 17th) considers both the suitability of the bin for the item (whether it can fit) and penalizes excessive leftover space, encouraging efficient use of bins. The worst heuristic (10th) always returns zero, making all bins equally unpreferred, which is counterproductive.
  
(Second best) vs (second worst), the second best (2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th) tries to fill bins tightly or considers factors like initial empty space, which can help in bin packing. However, these second-best heuristics often lack the nuanced balancing of fit and leftover space prioritized by the best ones.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic directly penalizes too much leftover space using a rational formula that balances remaining capacity and leftover space. In contrast, the sinusoidal factor in the 2nd heuristic complicates the prioritization without achieving the same balance or simplicity.

(3rd) vs (4th), similar to the comparison of (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) uses a straightforward approach with a penalty factor, whereas (4th) applies a sinusoidal transformation which adds complexity without clear improvement.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that while the second worst tries to incorporate multiple factors (12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 19th, 20th)-like remaining capacity, proximity to item size, penalizing for new bin creation, etc.- these attempts are less refined and lack the elegant balancing act seen in the top heuristics.

Overall:

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by focusing on balancing factors that both encourage suitable bin placement and penalize inefficiencies like excessive leftover space. Avoid overly complex transformations or random elements that do not contribute to improvement.
