Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    item: float, \n    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, \n    alpha: float = 0.4499271859778464, \n    beta: float = 0.04843602212790765, \n    gamma: float = 0.2684362640521154, \n    sigmoid_penalty_threshold: float = 2.7985568202021485e-06, \n    balance_factor_threshold: float = 2.129867250402941e-06) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Prioritize bins by combining adaptive learning, balance factor, and sigmoid penalty.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        alpha: Weight for Scaled Remaining Capacity.\n        beta: Weight for Balance Factor.\n        gamma: Weight for Last Fit Decrease.\n        sigmoid_penalty_threshold: Threshold for sigmoid penalty calculation.\n        balance_factor_threshold: Threshold for balance factor calculation.\n\n    Returns:\n        Array of priority scores for each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Scaled Remaining Capacity with sigmoid penalty\n    scaled_remaining_capacity = np.where(\n        bins_remain_cap >= item, \n        1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + sigmoid_penalty_threshold), \n        -np.inf\n    )\n\n    # Balance Factor: Encourage a more balanced distribution\n    mean_cap = np.mean(bins_remain_cap)\n    balance_factor = np.abs(mean_cap - bins_remain_cap) / np.max(np.abs(mean_cap - bins_remain_cap) + balance_factor_threshold)\n\n    # Last Fit Decrease (LFD) Heuristic\n    last_fit_decrease = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    if len(bins_remain_cap) > 1:\n        last_fit_decrease[1:] = bins_remain_cap[:-1] - bins_remain_cap[1:]\n\n    # Combine heuristics with adaptive learning\n    priority_scores = (\n        alpha * scaled_remaining_capacity +\n        beta * (1 - balance_factor) +\n        gamma * last_fit_decrease\n    )\n\n    return priority_scores\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive learning, dynamic adjustments, balanced penalties, sigmoid functions, bin packing efficiency\n- **Advice**: Focus on integrating real-time data feedback to dynamically adjust weights in balance factor calculations, incorporating sigmoid functions to adjust penalty scales smoothly based on current performance metrics.\n- **Avoid**: Statistically insignificant transformations, overly random element incorporations, and duplicate techniques without additional value.\n- **Explanation**: By continuously adapting based on feedback and using smooth, mathematically justified functions for adjustments, heuristics can evolve to perform optimally, mitigating inefficiencies and improving bin packing outcomes significantly.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
