- **Keywords**: Adaptive learning, dynamic weights, threshold optimization, domain-specific data
- **Advice**: Continuously calibrate weights and thresholds based on domain-specific data to optimize performance. Implement adaptive learning to refine balance factors over iterations.
- **Avoid**: Overly complex algorithms, static parameters, random adjustments, and generic approaches.
- **Explanation**: By focusing on dynamic and adaptive mechanisms grounded in specific domain data, the heuristic can become more responsive and efficient. This avoids the pitfalls of one-size-fits-all solutions and the inefficiencies caused by static parameters or random transformations.
