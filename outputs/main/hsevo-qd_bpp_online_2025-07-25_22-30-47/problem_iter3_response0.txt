def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This heuristic uses a modular approach with two main components:
    1. Tightness Heuristic: Prioritizes bins that are almost full.
    2. Balance Heuristic: Penalizes bins that are too full or too empty compared to others.

    The priorities are combined with weights to balance their influence.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
