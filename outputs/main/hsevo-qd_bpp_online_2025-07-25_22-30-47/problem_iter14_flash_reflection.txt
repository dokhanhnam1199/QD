**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics dynamically adjusts weights based on system state, which allows for more intelligent adaptation to varying conditions. In contrast, the worst heuristics use fixed weights and thresholds, reducing their flexibility and optimization potential. (Second best) vs (second worst) highlights a significant improvement in adaptability and dynamic weighting, showing the benefit of responsive design. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first maintains the adaptive approach without unnecessary imports and parameters, streamlining the process. (3rd) vs (4th) also follows this pattern, emphasizing the importance of simplification while retaining adaptive features. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the latter lacks in adapting weights and thresholds, making it less effective under varying loads. Overall: Dynamic adjustment of weights and thresholds outperforms static configurations, and simpler implementations maintain efficiency.

**Experience:**
Dynamic adjustment of weights and thresholds improves heuristic adaptability, while keeping the code simple enhances efficiency and maintainability.
