- **Advice**: Focus on modular sub-heuristics, integrate adaptive learning, emphasize clear improvement criteria, and ensure feedback mechanisms.
- **Avoid**: Overly complex algorithms, random adjustments, opaque rules, and intuitive but non-quantifiable optimizations.
- **Explanation**: By modularizing heuristics, you can refine specific areas without affecting others. Adaptive learning allows the heuristic to improve over time. Clear improvement criteria ensure that changes are beneficial, and feedback mechanisms foster continuous optimization. Avoiding complexity and randomness ensures that the heuristic remains understandable and efficient.
