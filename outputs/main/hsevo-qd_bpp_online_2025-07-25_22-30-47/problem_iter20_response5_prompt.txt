The worst heuristic lacks these features, relying on static weights and thresholds. (2nd) vs (2nd worst) shows a similar trend where the better heuristic uses adaptive learning and dynamic adjustments. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the primary difference lies in the inclusion of historical data and adaptation factors in the better heuristic. (3rd) vs (4th) indicates that the better heuristic uses adaptive weights and dynamic thresholds, whereas the worse one relies on static parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the worse heuristic does not adjust weights or incorporate adaptive learning, leading to less effective prioritization. Overall, the top-ranked heuristics benefit from adaptive learning, dynamic weights, and historical data, enabling them to better manage varying conditions and optimize bin placement.\n- \n- **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, dynamic weights, refined balance factor, domain-specific data\n- **Advice:** \n  - Integrate machine learning techniques for adaptive learning to fine-tune heuristics over time.\n  - Continuously adjust weights and thresholds based on performance data and feedback loops to enhance adaptability.\n  - Employ refined balance factors that effectively balance incentives for optimal bin placement with penalties for inefficiency.\n  - Leverage domain-specific data for parameter tuning to optimize heuristic efficiency without increasing complexity.\n- **Avoid:** \n  - Repeated use of static coefficients without dynamic adjustment.\n  - Incorporating overly complex or random transformations that do not significantly improve performance.\n  - Excessive focus on random elements or overly complicated methods.\n- **Explanation:** By focusing on adaptive learning and continuous refinement with concrete parameters informed by domain-specific data, the heuristic can evolve and improve without becoming overly complex. This approach ensures the heuristic remains efficient, maintainable, and tailored to specific optimization tasks.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
