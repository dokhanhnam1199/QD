Here's a refined approach to self-reflection, focusing on actionable insights for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Problem domain analysis, dynamic adaptation, performance evaluation, edge case handling.

*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in deep problem domain understanding. Prioritize adaptation to input characteristics. Rigorously evaluate heuristic performance across diverse scenarios.

*   **Avoid:** Vague considerations, premature parameterization without justification, neglecting comprehensive testing.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond generic advice. Emphasize data-driven adaptation and thorough evaluation to create robust heuristics. Deeply analyse corner and edge cases.
