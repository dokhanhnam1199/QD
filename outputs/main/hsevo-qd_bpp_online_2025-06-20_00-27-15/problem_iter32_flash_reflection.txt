**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (17th), we see that the top heuristic incorporates a much broader set of factors, including fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization, space balance, bin diversity, a fill target, an almost-full penalty, and a median proximity bonus. In contrast, the 17th heuristic only considers remaining space and fill ratio.
(2nd) vs (16th) are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (15th), we see the 3rd heuristic considers space balance, adaptive weight based on item size and bin diversity. The 15th heuristic is a stripped down version of the concept, only focusing on basic fill ratio and remaining space.
Comparing (4th) vs (14th), we see the 4th heuristic uses adaptive weights based on item size. 14th heuristic provides parameters such as invalid_priority and epsilon.
Comparing (5th) vs (13th), we see that the 13th heuristic introduces adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size and also include empty bin penalty.
Comparing (6th) vs (12th) are identical.
Comparing (7th) vs (11th) are identical.
Comparing (8th) vs (10th) are similar but 10th has more verbose comments.
Comparing (9th) vs (20th), we see that the 9th heuristic is simpler, the 20th uses more parameters.
Comparing (18th) vs (19th) are similar but 18th includes some code, while 19th is just the docstring.
Overall: The better heuristics introduce more factors and adaptive weights. They often consider balancing fill levels across bins, penalizing nearly full bins, and promoting diversity in bin capacities. They also often include more configuration parameters.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider a wide range of potentially relevant factors and introduce adaptive mechanisms such as weights that adjust based on input characteristics to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space.
