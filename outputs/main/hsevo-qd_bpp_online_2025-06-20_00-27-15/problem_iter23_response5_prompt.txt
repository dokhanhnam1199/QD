Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The 1st heuristic uses adaptive weights based on item size, a space balance strategy, and considers fill ratio, remaining space penalty, and capacity utilization. In contrast, the 20th heuristic only initializes `priorities` array and returns if no valid bins. This indicates that the 1st heuristic attempts a more nuanced and potentially more effective approach to bin packing.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the 2nd heuristic incorporates item size weighting directly into the priority calculation, while the second worst heuristic initializes `priorities` array and returns if no valid bins. The space balance weighting is reduced in the 2nd best.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), the 1st heuristic uses adaptive weights based on item size relative to bin sizes, adjusting the fill ratio weight. The 2nd heuristic uses a fixed item size weight.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), both heuristics are identical, indicating a possible tie in their performance or a lack of differentiation in the evaluation.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), both heuristics are same.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors such as fill ratio, remaining space, capacity utilization, and space balance. They also use adaptive weighting mechanisms to adjust the influence of these factors based on item size or other relevant parameters. The worst heuristics are often simplified versions that only consider basic fill ratio and remaining space, or even fail to implement a scoring mechanism if no valid bins are found. The more sophisticated heuristics introduce adaptive elements and penalties to better guide the packing process.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, actively avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\". Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptive, Parameter Tuning, Iterative Refinement.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on combining *multiple interacting* factors, using adaptive parameter tuning *driven by data analysis and feedback* from performance on diverse datasets.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, premature complexity, and parameters without justification/validation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply listing factors. Prioritize understanding their interplay and using data-driven adaptive mechanisms to improve performance via an iterative build-measure-analyze-refine approach.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
