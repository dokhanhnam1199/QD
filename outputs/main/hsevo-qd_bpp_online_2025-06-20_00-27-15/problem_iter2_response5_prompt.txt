Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    new_capacities = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.\n    valid_bins = new_capacities >= 0\n\n    # Initialize priorities with a very low value (e.g., -np.inf) for invalid bins.\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 0  # Reset valid bins to 0 for further scoring.\n\n    # For valid bins, calculate a score based on remaining capacity after packing.\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n    \n    # Scoring valid bins\n    priorities[valid_bins] = (item / bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]) + (1 / (remaining_space + 0.000001))\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    ratios = item / bins_remain_cap\n    log_ratios = np.log(ratios)\n    priorities = -log_ratios\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see that the best heuristic considers both the ratio of item size to bin capacity *and* the remaining space in the bin, while the worst one only considers the ratio. The best heuristic uses `item / bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] + (1 / (remaining_space + 0.000001))`, while the worst heuristic uses `-np.log(item / bins_remain_cap)`. The `0.000001` is added to avoid division by zero. Comparing (2nd) vs (12th), we see that both heuristics are similar to their corresponding first and eleventh heuristics. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (11th) vs (12th), we see they are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Overall, the top 10 heuristics are identical to each other, and the bottom 10 are identical. The top 10 perform better than the bottom 10. The key difference is the scoring function. The better scoring function considers both the fullness of the bin after adding the item (item size / bin capacity) and the remaining space.\n- \nOkay, I'm ready to redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing bin packing heuristics, keeping in mind what to avoid based on the (currently empty) \"Ineffective self-reflection\" list. Let's aim for actionable insights.\n\nHere's a refined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Bin Packing, Heuristics, Evaluation Metrics, Waste Minimization, Item Ordering, Lookahead.\n\n*   **Advice:** Evaluate heuristics based on multiple metrics (e.g., number of bins used, wasted space, runtime). Experiment with different item ordering strategies (e.g., largest-first, smallest-first, random). Consider incorporating a limited lookahead to anticipate the impact of placements.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, focusing solely on bin fullness without considering the broader impact on the overall solution, neglecting computational cost.\n\n*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes a more comprehensive evaluation of heuristic performance, encourages exploration of diverse strategies, and reminds us to be mindful of computational resources.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
