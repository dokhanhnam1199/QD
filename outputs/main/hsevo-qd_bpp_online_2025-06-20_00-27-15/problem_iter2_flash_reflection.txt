**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see that the best heuristic considers both the ratio of item size to bin capacity *and* the remaining space in the bin, while the worst one only considers the ratio. The best heuristic uses `item / bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] + (1 / (remaining_space + 0.000001))`, while the worst heuristic uses `-np.log(item / bins_remain_cap)`. The `0.000001` is added to avoid division by zero. Comparing (2nd) vs (12th), we see that both heuristics are similar to their corresponding first and eleventh heuristics. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (11th) vs (12th), we see they are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Overall, the top 10 heuristics are identical to each other, and the bottom 10 are identical. The top 10 perform better than the bottom 10. The key difference is the scoring function. The better scoring function considers both the fullness of the bin after adding the item (item size / bin capacity) and the remaining space.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider both how full a bin will be if an item is added and how much space will be left over. Combining these factors can lead to more efficient packing strategies. Avoiding division by zero is important.
