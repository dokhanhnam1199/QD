**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic explicitly handles invalid bins by assigning them a very low priority (-np.inf) and calculates a priority score based on both the packing density and a "tight fit" bonus, while the worst only calculates priorities based on the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical, using constants invalid_priority and epsilon. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best uses inline constants while second uses arguments. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical to 2nd and 1st respectively. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst) show the same algorithm. Overall: The better heuristics prioritize a combination of factors, including packing density, tight fit, and handling of invalid bins, while the worse heuristics focus solely on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. The top heuristics are concise, while others include unnecessary imports. Heuristics that adapt to item size perform better.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Explicitly handle invalid or edge cases. Favor concise code. Adaptive parameter adjustments based on input characteristics can be beneficial.
