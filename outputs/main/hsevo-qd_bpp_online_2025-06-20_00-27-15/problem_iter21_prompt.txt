Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    new_capacities = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.\n    valid_bins = new_capacities >= 0\n\n    # Initialize priorities with a very low value for invalid bins.\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n\n    # Prioritize bins that can fit the item\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 0\n\n    # Calculate remaining space after packing for valid bins\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n\n    # Scoring valid bins: Introduce a combination of factors.\n    # 1.

The goal is to provide actionable advice applicable beyond specific problems like bin packing.\n\nHere's a redefined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptability, Validation, Parsimony.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering multiple, relevant factors *and their interactions.* Implement *adaptive mechanisms* based on input features. Rigorously *validate* each component's contribution.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, premature complexity, problem-specific examples (e.g., bin packing), generic statements (e.g., \"clear documentation\"), focusing solely on fullness/emptiness.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple criteria. Adaptability allows optimization across diverse inputs. Validation ensures each component contributes. Parsimony prevents overfitting and maintains efficiency. Focus on *general principles* applicable across various heuristic design problems, rather than specific examples.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
