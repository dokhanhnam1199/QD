Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflections.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Tunable, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that combine multiple relevant factors, implement adaptive parameters and weights informed by input characteristics, and prioritize rigorous testing and validation of each factor.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single metrics, hardcoded parameters, and complexity without demonstrated benefit.
*   **Explanation:** Go beyond single-factor approaches. Create a system with parameters that change based on data to keep it flexible. Test and prove each factor's impact. Simple is okay, but it has to work well.
