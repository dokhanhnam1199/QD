Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, specifically targeting the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a redefined and more actionable approach:

*   **Keywords:** Factor prioritization, dynamic adaptation, edge case robustness, concise implementation, performance validation.

*   **Advice:** Start with relevant factors, meticulously validate their impact, prioritize them adaptively based on problem characteristics, and explicitly handle edge cases with concise code.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, unjustified complexity/parameters, neglecting performance validation, and static, inflexible approaches.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on a data-driven, adaptive approach. Prioritize rigorous validation of each component and avoid introducing complexity without demonstrable performance improvement.
