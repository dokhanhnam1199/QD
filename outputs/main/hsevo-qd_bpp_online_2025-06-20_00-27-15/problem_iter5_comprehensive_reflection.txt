Okay, let's aim for a more effective self-reflection framework for heuristic design, directly addressing the weaknesses of the "Ineffective self-reflection" example.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, Adaptive parameters, Iterative refinement, Performance metrics.
*   **Advice:** Focus on creating heuristics that adapt to different instance characteristics and track performance metrics to drive iterative improvement.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of factors, neglecting edge cases beyond division by zero, lack of a performance feedback loop.
*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics with multiple interacting components, tuned by parameters refined based on data. Quantify success (e.g. wasted space, number of bins).
