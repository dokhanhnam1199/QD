Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    new_capacities = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.\n    valid_bins = new_capacities >= 0\n\n    # Initialize priorities with a very low value for invalid bins.\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n\n    # Prioritize bins that can fit the item\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 0\n\n    # Calculate remaining space after packing for valid bins\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n\n    # Scoring valid bins: Introduce a combination of factors.\n    # 1.

The better heuristic attempts to balance space utilization and avoid overfilling, whereas the worst only focuses on initial fill.\nComparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the second-best heuristic includes an item size weighting, while the third does not. This suggests that considering the size of the item relative to the bin capacity is beneficial.\nComparing (1st) vs (3rd), (2nd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (6th), (8th) vs (9th), the main difference is the inclusion of item size weighting in the better heuristics.\nComparing (11th) vs (12th), there is no difference between these two functions.\nComparing (13th) vs (16th), the 13th includes a penalty for bins that become too empty and adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size, while the 16th just uses a combination of fill ratio and remaining space penalty. The first prioritizes a balanced fill and adapts to item size, while the second focuses on immediate space utilization.\nComparing (15th) vs (16th), there is no difference between these two functions.\nComparing (17th) vs (18th), (15th) and (18th) is the same, and (13th) and (17th) is the same. The 17th includes a penalty for bins that become too empty and adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size, while the 18th just uses a combination of fill ratio and remaining space penalty. The first prioritizes a balanced fill and adapts to item size, while the second focuses on immediate space utilization.\nComparing (19th) vs (20th), the 19th uses fill ratio and remaining space penalty while the 20th uses logarithm of the fill ratio.\n\nOverall: the better heuristics consider more factors, such as fill ratio, remaining space, capacity utilization, space balance, and item size. They also adapt the weighting of these factors based on the item size. Simpler heuristics that only consider one or two factors tend to perform worse. Adaptive weighting and balancing multiple factors is key.\n- \nHere's a refined approach to self-reflection, focusing on actionable insights for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Problem domain analysis, dynamic adaptation, performance evaluation, edge case handling.\n\n*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in deep problem domain understanding. Prioritize adaptation to input characteristics. Rigorously evaluate heuristic performance across diverse scenarios.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague considerations, premature parameterization without justification, neglecting comprehensive testing.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond generic advice. Emphasize data-driven adaptation and thorough evaluation to create robust heuristics. Deeply analyse corner and edge cases.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
