Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for better heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive heuristics, multi-factor analysis, parameter tuning, performance evaluation, iterative refinement, edge cases.

*   **Advice:** Emphasize a data-driven, iterative approach. Start with simpler heuristics, rigorously test and analyze performance. Identify weaknesses and incrementally add complexity only when justified by measurable improvements. Consider adaptive parameter tuning based on input data.

*   **Avoid:** Hardcoding parameters or adding complexity without empirical justification. Oversimplification that ignores key problem characteristics. Sole reliance on single metrics.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection focuses on objective performance data. It avoids premature optimization and ensures complexity genuinely improves solution quality. Prioritize adaptability and validated incremental improvements.
