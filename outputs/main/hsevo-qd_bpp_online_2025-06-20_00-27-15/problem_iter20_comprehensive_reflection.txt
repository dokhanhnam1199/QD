Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding the pitfalls demonstrated in the "Ineffective Self-Reflection" examples.  The goal is to provide actionable advice applicable beyond specific problems like bin packing.

Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptability, Validation, Parsimony.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering multiple, relevant factors *and their interactions.* Implement *adaptive mechanisms* based on input features. Rigorously *validate* each component's contribution.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, premature complexity, problem-specific examples (e.g., bin packing), generic statements (e.g., "clear documentation"), focusing solely on fullness/emptiness.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple criteria. Adaptability allows optimization across diverse inputs. Validation ensures each component contributes. Parsimony prevents overfitting and maintains efficiency. Focus on *general principles* applicable across various heuristic design problems, rather than specific examples.
