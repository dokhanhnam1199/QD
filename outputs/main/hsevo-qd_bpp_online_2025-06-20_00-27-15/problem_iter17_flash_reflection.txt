**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st one includes `item_size_weight` while the 20th does not; (2nd best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the weight of `space_balance` reduced; (3rd) vs (4th) ..., there are no differences; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there are no differences; Overall: The better heuristics consider the item size and dynamically adjust weights of different factors based on the item size relative to the bin capacities. The worst heuristics often lack a mechanism to prioritize larger items or to penalize bins that become too empty. They also do not effectively adjust the weights of different factors based on item size or bin capacity.

**Experience:**

To design better bin packing heuristics, consider incorporating item size weighting, dynamically adjusting weights based on relative item/bin sizes, and penalizing excessively empty bins. Balancing multiple factors and adapting to the specifics of item sizes can lead to better space utilization.
