**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization, and space balance, while the worst uses only the logarithm of the fill ratio. The better heuristic attempts to balance space utilization and avoid overfilling, whereas the worst only focuses on initial fill.
Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the second-best heuristic includes an item size weighting, while the third does not. This suggests that considering the size of the item relative to the bin capacity is beneficial.
Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), (2nd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (6th), (8th) vs (9th), the main difference is the inclusion of item size weighting in the better heuristics.
Comparing (11th) vs (12th), there is no difference between these two functions.
Comparing (13th) vs (16th), the 13th includes a penalty for bins that become too empty and adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size, while the 16th just uses a combination of fill ratio and remaining space penalty. The first prioritizes a balanced fill and adapts to item size, while the second focuses on immediate space utilization.
Comparing (15th) vs (16th), there is no difference between these two functions.
Comparing (17th) vs (18th), (15th) and (18th) is the same, and (13th) and (17th) is the same. The 17th includes a penalty for bins that become too empty and adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size, while the 18th just uses a combination of fill ratio and remaining space penalty. The first prioritizes a balanced fill and adapts to item size, while the second focuses on immediate space utilization.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), the 19th uses fill ratio and remaining space penalty while the 20th uses logarithm of the fill ratio.

Overall: the better heuristics consider more factors, such as fill ratio, remaining space, capacity utilization, space balance, and item size. They also adapt the weighting of these factors based on the item size. Simpler heuristics that only consider one or two factors tend to perform worse. Adaptive weighting and balancing multiple factors is key.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider multiple factors related to space utilization and item characteristics. Employ adaptive weighting strategies based on item size or other relevant parameters to dynamically adjust the heuristic's behavior. Focus on achieving a balance between tight fits and avoiding excessive empty space.
