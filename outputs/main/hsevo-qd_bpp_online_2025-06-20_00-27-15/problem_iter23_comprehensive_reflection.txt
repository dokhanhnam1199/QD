Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, actively avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection". Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptive, Parameter Tuning, Iterative Refinement.

*   **Advice:** Focus on combining *multiple interacting* factors, using adaptive parameter tuning *driven by data analysis and feedback* from performance on diverse datasets.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, premature complexity, and parameters without justification/validation.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply listing factors. Prioritize understanding their interplay and using data-driven adaptive mechanisms to improve performance via an iterative build-measure-analyze-refine approach.
