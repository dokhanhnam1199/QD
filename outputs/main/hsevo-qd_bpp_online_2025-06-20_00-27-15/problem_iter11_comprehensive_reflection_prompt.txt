{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a multi-faceted approach that incorporates relevant factors. Avoid oversimplification but also resist the urge to add complexity with poorly justified parameters. Thoroughly test and validate each factor to ensure its contribution to the overall heuristic performance.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Explicitly handle invalid or edge cases. Favor concise code. Adaptive parameter adjustments based on input characteristics can be beneficial.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider both how full a bin will be if an item is added and how much space will be left over. Combining these factors can lead to more efficient packing strategies. Avoiding division by zero is important.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors and including parameters for fine-tuning. Favor approaches that promote both fullness and efficient space utilization within bins. Also, remember clear documentation is crucial.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
