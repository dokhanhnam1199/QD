{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing bin-packing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors (fill ratio, remaining space, capacity utilization) with adaptive weights based on item characteristics. Penalties for undesirable outcomes, such as leaving too much empty space, can also improve performance. Start with a simple heuristic and iteratively add complexity based on performance analysis.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Explicitly handle invalid or edge cases. Favor concise code. Adaptive parameter adjustments based on input characteristics can be beneficial.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider a combination of relevant factors and their interactions, rather than relying on a single metric. Introduce tunable parameters for flexibility and consider adaptive weighting based on input characteristics to enhance robustness.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider both how full a bin will be if an item is added and how much space will be left over. Combining these factors can lead to more efficient packing strategies. Avoiding division by zero is important.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors and including parameters for fine-tuning. Favor approaches that promote both fullness and efficient space utilization within bins. Also, remember clear documentation is crucial.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a multi-faceted approach that incorporates relevant factors. Avoid oversimplification but also resist the urge to add complexity with poorly justified parameters. Thoroughly test and validate each factor to ensure its contribution to the overall heuristic performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider multiple factors related to space utilization and item characteristics. Employ adaptive weighting strategies based on item size or other relevant parameters to dynamically adjust the heuristic's behavior. Focus on achieving a balance between tight fits and avoiding excessive empty space.\n\nTo design better bin packing heuristics, consider incorporating item size weighting, dynamically adjusting weights based on relative item/bin sizes, and penalizing excessively empty bins. Balancing multiple factors and adapting to the specifics of item sizes can lead to better space utilization.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
