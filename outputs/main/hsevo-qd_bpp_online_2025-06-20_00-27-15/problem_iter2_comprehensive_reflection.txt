Okay, I'm ready to redefine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing bin packing heuristics, keeping in mind what to avoid based on the (currently empty) "Ineffective self-reflection" list. Let's aim for actionable insights.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Bin Packing, Heuristics, Evaluation Metrics, Waste Minimization, Item Ordering, Lookahead.

*   **Advice:** Evaluate heuristics based on multiple metrics (e.g., number of bins used, wasted space, runtime). Experiment with different item ordering strategies (e.g., largest-first, smallest-first, random). Consider incorporating a limited lookahead to anticipate the impact of placements.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, focusing solely on bin fullness without considering the broader impact on the overall solution, neglecting computational cost.

*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes a more comprehensive evaluation of heuristic performance, encourages exploration of diverse strategies, and reminds us to be mindful of computational resources.
