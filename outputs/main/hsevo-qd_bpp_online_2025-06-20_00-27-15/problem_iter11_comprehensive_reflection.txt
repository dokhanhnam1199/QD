Here's a refined take on "Current self-reflection" aimed at designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Factor validation, adaptive parameters, edge case handling, conciseness.

*   **Advice:** Rigorously validate factors and parameters, adapt parameters based on input characteristics, explicitly address edge cases, and strive for concise code.

*   **Avoid:** Unjustified complexity, premature optimization, neglecting edge cases, opaque or difficult-to-maintain code.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on evidence-based inclusion of factors, adapting to problem instances, and prioritizing clarity and robustness alongside performance. Avoid complexity that is not justified by empirical evidence.
