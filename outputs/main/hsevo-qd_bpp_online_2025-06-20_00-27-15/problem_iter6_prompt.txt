Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    new_capacities = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.\n    valid_bins = new_capacities >= 0\n\n    # Initialize priorities with a very low value (e.g., -np.inf) for invalid bins.\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 0  # Reset valid bins to 0 for further scoring.\n\n    # For valid bins, calculate a score based on remaining capacity after packing.\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n    \n    # Scoring valid bins\n    priorities[valid_bins] = (item / bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]) + (1 / (remaining_space + 0.000001))\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's aim for a more effective self-reflection framework for heuristic design, directly addressing the weaknesses of the \"Ineffective self-reflection\" example.\n\nHere's a refined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, Adaptive parameters, Iterative refinement, Performance metrics.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on creating heuristics that adapt to different instance characteristics and track performance metrics to drive iterative improvement.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of factors, neglecting edge cases beyond division by zero, lack of a performance feedback loop.\n*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics with multiple interacting components, tuned by parameters refined based on data. Quantify success (e.g. wasted space, number of bins).\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
