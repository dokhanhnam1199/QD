Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    new_capacities = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item.\n    valid_bins = new_capacities >= 0\n\n    # Initialize priorities with a very low value for invalid bins.\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)\n\n    # Prioritize bins that can fit the item\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 0\n\n    # Calculate remaining space after packing for valid bins\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n\n    # Scoring valid bins: Introduce a combination of factors.\n    # 1.

Both consider fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization, and space balance. The 1st one slightly reduces the weighting of `space_balance` which may lead to a more balanced result when item size is considered.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.\n\nComparing (10th) vs (11th), 10th takes `invalid_priority` and `epsilon` as parameters to allow more flexible tuning and avoids hardcoding, the 11th one has hardcoded values.\n\nComparing (13th) vs (14th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.\n\nComparing (15th) vs (16th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.\n\nComparing (17th) vs (16th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics consider more factors (fill ratio, remaining space, capacity utilization, space balance, item size) in a combined manner, often with tunable parameters. Simpler heuristics that rely on a single metric like log ratio tend to perform worse. Introducing adaptive weighting based on item size relative to bin size appears to improve performance. Penalizing almost full bins and empty bins improves performance too.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding the pitfalls demonstrated in the \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\" examples.  The goal is to provide actionable advice applicable beyond specific problems like bin packing.\n\nHere's a redefined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptability, Validation, Parsimony.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics considering multiple, relevant factors *and their interactions.* Implement *adaptive mechanisms* based on input features. Rigorously *validate* each component's contribution.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, premature complexity, problem-specific examples (e.g., bin packing), generic statements (e.g., \"clear documentation\"), focusing solely on fullness/emptiness.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance multiple criteria. Adaptability allows optimization across diverse inputs. Validation ensures each component contributes. Parsimony prevents overfitting and maintains efficiency. Focus on *general principles* applicable across various heuristic design problems, rather than specific examples.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
