**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first incorporates numerous factors like fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization, space balance, adaptive weights, bin diversity penalty, target fill level, almost full penalty, and median proximity bonus, while the last only checks if bins can accommodate items, and assigns -inf if not.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), both functions are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these functions are identical too.
Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), the 18th prioritizes bins based on fullness and remaining space with minor flexibility (invalid_priority, epsilon) while the 20th only checks if bins can accommodate items, and assigns -inf if not.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), these functions are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these functions are identical.
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), these functions are identical.
Comparing (7th) vs (8th), these functions are identical.
Comparing (9th) vs (10th), these functions are identical.
Comparing (11th) vs (12th), these functions are identical.
Comparing (13th) vs (14th), we observe the 14th includes item size relative to average remaining capacity and empty bin penalty, where the 13th don't.
Comparing (15th) vs (16th), we see the 15th prioritizes packing density, tight fit bonus and empty penalty with adaptive weights and 16th prioritizes fullness and remaining space.
Comparing (17th) vs (18th), the 17th prioritizes packing density, tight fit bonus and empty penalty with adaptive weights and 18th prioritizes fullness and remaining space with minor flexibility (invalid_priority, epsilon).
Overall: The better heuristics consider more factors with adaptive parameter adjustments based on item size, which improves bin packing efficiency by considering various aspects. The worse heuristics often neglect these details and primarily focus on basic feasibility, leading to suboptimal packing.

**Experience:**
Complex heuristics may yield better results but requires careful tuning of weights and parameters. Adaptive weights, based on item size, can significantly impact performance. Focus on factors that encourage balanced filling, penalize nearly-full bins, and reward tight fits.
