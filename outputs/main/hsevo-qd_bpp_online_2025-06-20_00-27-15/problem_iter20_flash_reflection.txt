**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st uses a combination of fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization, space balance and item size weighting, while the 20th directly calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. 1st prioritizes more factors contributing to overall packing efficiency.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see the 2nd uses combination of fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization and space balance, while the 19th directly calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. 2nd prioritizes more factors contributing to overall packing efficiency.

Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), we see the 3rd uses a combination of fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization and space balance, while the 18th directly calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. 3rd prioritizes more factors contributing to overall packing efficiency.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st introduces item size weighting, while the 2nd does not. Both consider fill ratio, remaining space penalty, capacity utilization, and space balance. The 1st one slightly reduces the weighting of `space_balance` which may lead to a more balanced result when item size is considered.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), 10th takes `invalid_priority` and `epsilon` as parameters to allow more flexible tuning and avoids hardcoding, the 11th one has hardcoded values.

Comparing (13th) vs (14th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.

Comparing (17th) vs (16th), they are identical. This suggests that their relative ranking is arbitrary, or there were no effective change.

Overall: The better heuristics consider more factors (fill ratio, remaining space, capacity utilization, space balance, item size) in a combined manner, often with tunable parameters. Simpler heuristics that rely on a single metric like log ratio tend to perform worse. Introducing adaptive weighting based on item size relative to bin size appears to improve performance. Penalizing almost full bins and empty bins improves performance too.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider a combination of relevant factors and their interactions, rather than relying on a single metric. Introduce tunable parameters for flexibility and consider adaptive weighting based on input characteristics to enhance robustness.
