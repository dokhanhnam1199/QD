Okay, I understand the goal. We need to redefine "Current self-reflection" to be *effective* for designing heuristics, focusing on actionable advice while explicitly avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective self-reflection" examples. These examples suffer from being too specific (bin packing only) and too vague (documentation, fine-tuning parameters without concrete guidance).

Here's a redefinition:

*   **Keywords:** Generalizability, Actionable, Problem-Specific, Evaluation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics using problem-specific knowledge and measurable objectives. Prioritize adaptability to diverse problem instances. Clearly define success metrics *before* implementation.
*   **Avoid:** Overly narrow examples. Vague advice on parameters without guidance. Focusing on trivial concerns (division by zero).
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should leverage deep understanding of the problem. Instead of generic statements, focus on testable hypotheses based on that understanding. Emphasize *evaluating* the heuristic's performance against clearly defined goals, which will guide further refinements and parameter adjustments.
