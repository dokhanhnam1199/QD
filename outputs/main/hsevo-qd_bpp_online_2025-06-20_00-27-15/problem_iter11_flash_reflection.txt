**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st one considers remaining space, fill ratio, capacity utilization, and space balance, while the 20th only considers log ratios of item size to bin capacity. This suggests a more comprehensive evaluation of bin suitability leads to better performance.

(2nd) vs (19th) and (3rd) vs (18th) show a similar pattern. The initial versions incorporate multiple factors, while the later versions rely solely on the log ratio of item size to bin capacity. The more nuanced approach is superior.

Comparing (4th) vs (17th) and onward, we see the introduction of `invalid_priority` and `epsilon` parameters. Although these parameters are intended to improve robustness (handling edge cases), their inclusion does not demonstrably improve the overall heuristic and can even make it worse if not properly tuned. The simpler approach of handling invalid bins directly with `-np.inf` seems more effective.

Comparing (1st) vs (4th), the former considers capacity utilization and a space balance term, while the latter uses a simpler formula with only fill ratio and remaining space penalty. The added complexity in the first heuristic seems beneficial.

Comparing (1st) vs (7th), both have very similar structures, but the first has more features

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), almost the same.

Overall: Heuristics that consider multiple factors related to bin capacity, item size, and remaining space tend to perform better. Overly simplistic approaches (e.g., relying solely on log ratios) and the addition of untuned parameters (`invalid_priority`, `epsilon`) generally lead to worse results. A balance between comprehensive evaluation and simplicity is crucial, prioritizing meaningful factors without adding unnecessary complexity. The use of a well-defined invalid priority value (`-np.inf`) is superior to introducing tunable parameters for the same purpose.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, start with a multi-faceted approach that incorporates relevant factors. Avoid oversimplification but also resist the urge to add complexity with poorly justified parameters. Thoroughly test and validate each factor to ensure its contribution to the overall heuristic performance.
