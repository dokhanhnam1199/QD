Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines utilization factor and remaining capacity for prioritization with a simple tie-breaker.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate utilization factor, avoiding division by zero\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item, using a combination of utilization and remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -np.abs(utilization_factor), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index with a small coefficient\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * tie_breaker_coef)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines fit score, remaining capacity, and bin index for effective prioritization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate relative size and fit score\n    epsilon = 1e-6  # Avoid division by zero\n    relative_size = item / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    fit_score = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 - relative_size, 0)\n\n    # Calculate priority score\n    max_capacity = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item  # Assuming all bins have the same max capacity\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, \n                        fit_score + 0.1 * (max_capacity - bins_remain_cap), \n                        -np.inf)\n\n    # Add a simple tie-breaker based on bin index with a small coefficient\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority = np.where(priority != -np.inf, priority + np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * 1e-3, -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st and 2nd) with the worst (19th and 20th), we see that the top heuristics use a more refined utilization factor calculation and a tie-breaker based on bin index. The worst heuristics introduce additional complexity with multiple factors and random noise. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical code, indicating potential redundancy or overfitting in the ranking. \n(3rd) vs (4th) shows a shift from a simpler utilization and remaining capacity calculation to a more complex scoring system. \nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see identical code again, similar to the top two. \nOverall, effective heuristics seem to balance simplicity with a thoughtful tie-breaker mechanism.\n- \nTo improve the 'Current self-reflection' and design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. \n\n* **Keywords**: simplicity, effective tie-breaker, prioritization, multiple factors, remaining capacity, bin fullness, randomness.\n* **Advice**: Combine multiple factors (e.g., remaining capacity, utilization, bin index) and use effective tie-breaking strategies. Consider simplicity and clear purpose for each component.\n* **Avoid**: Redundant complexity, unnecessary components, division by zero, and ineffective tie-breaking methods.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity, combining relevant factors, and using effective tie-breakers, we can create more efficient heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, ultimately leading to better performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
