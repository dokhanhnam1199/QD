Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority scores for each bin.\n    Combines effective prioritization with robust tie-breaking.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Prioritize bins with just enough capacity\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, 1e-9)  # Avoid division by zero\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -np.abs(utilization_factor) - (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.max(bins_remain_cap), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a small factor considering the bin index to break ties\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * 1e-3)  # Use a smaller coefficient\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines effective prioritization of bins with just enough capacity and robust tie-breaking.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the item can fit into the bin\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    \n    # Prioritize bins that are just enough for the item, with a simpler formula\n    priority = valid_bins * (-(bins_remain_cap - item))\n    \n    # Add a small random noise and consider bin index for tie-breaking\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += valid_bins * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) + np.random.rand(*priority.shape) * 1e-6)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best (Heuristics 1st) and the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that both prioritize bins with just enough capacity, but the best uses a more sophisticated utilization factor and a smaller coefficient for tie-breaking. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) uses a more complex utilization factor, while (2nd) relies on a combination of negative remaining capacity and bin utilization ratio. \n(3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) uses random noise for tie-breaking, whereas (4th) considers the proportion of remaining capacity occupied by the item. \nOverall, the top heuristics tend to use a combination of factors, including utilization, remaining capacity, and tie-breaking strategies.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's rethink the 'Current self-reflection' to avoid the pitfalls in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, tie-breaking, remaining capacity, utilization\n* **Advice**: Combine multiple factors effectively, handle edge cases, and use simple yet effective formulas for prioritization.\n* **Avoid**: Ineffective prioritization strategies, division by zero, and overly complex or concise code at the expense of clarity.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, handling edge cases, and using a balanced combination of factors for tie-breaking, we can design more efficient heuristics that outperform existing ones.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
