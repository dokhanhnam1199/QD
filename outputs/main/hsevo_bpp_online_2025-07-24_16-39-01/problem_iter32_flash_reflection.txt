**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic utilizes a more nuanced and weighted approach to calculating priority, incorporating multiple factors such as utilization factor, remaining capacity, and a sophisticated tie-breaker with carefully tuned coefficients. In contrast, the lower-ranked heuristics, while similar in structure, either lack the fine-tuning of coefficients or simplify certain aspects of the calculation. For instance, comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the top heuristic has optimized coefficients for its tie-breaker and weighted factors, suggesting the importance of these optimizations. (3rd) vs (4th) and other subsequent pairs show a gradual simplification or less optimal tuning of these elements. Notably, the worst heuristics (19th and 20th) are nearly identical and lack the nuanced weighting seen in the top heuristics. Overall, the key differentiators among the top heuristics are the sophistication of their tie-breakers and the weighting of their scoring factors.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on nuanced, weighted scoring that incorporates multiple factors, and optimize coefficients using a robust method. Sophisticated tie-breakers can significantly impact performance.
