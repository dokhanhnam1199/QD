def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements the First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) priority 
    heuristic, a variation of which is suitable for online bin packing. 
    The priority is higher for bins that have just enough remaining capacity 
    to hold the item.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the priority score for each bin. 
    # A bin with remaining capacity closer to the item size gets higher priority.
    # Bins that cannot fit the item get a priority score of negative infinity.
