Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function implements the First-Fit decreasing heuristic with a twist.\n    It prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity for the item.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the priority score for each bin\n    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item\n    # So, we use the negative of the remaining capacity after adding the item\n    # If the item doesn't fit, the priority score is negative infinity\n    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)\n    \n    # To avoid division by zero and make the score more meaningful, we can add a small value to the denominator\n    # However, in this case, it's not necessary because we're not using the remaining capacity as a denominator\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's rethink the 'Current self-reflection' to avoid the pitfalls in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, tie-breaking, remaining capacity, utilization\n* **Advice**: Combine multiple factors effectively, handle edge cases, and use simple yet effective formulas for prioritization.\n* **Avoid**: Ineffective prioritization strategies, division by zero, and overly complex or concise code at the expense of clarity.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, handling edge cases, and using a balanced combination of factors for tie-breaking, we can design more efficient heuristics that outperform existing ones.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
