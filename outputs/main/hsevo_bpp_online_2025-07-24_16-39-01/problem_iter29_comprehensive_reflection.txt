To redefine 'Current self-reflection' and avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

* Keywords: Utilization, Remaining Capacity, Tie-breaking, Simplicity
* Advice: 
  • Balance multiple factors like utilization and remaining capacity.
  • Use simple yet effective tie-breakers based on bin index or other relevant characteristics.
  • Experiment with different weightings and combinations of these factors.
  • Focus on combining key factors with effective tie-breakers.
* Avoid: Redundant complexity, excessive randomness, unnecessary complexity, ineffective prioritization strategies.
* Explanation: The redefined 'Current self-reflection' should focus on balancing multiple relevant factors and using effective tie-breakers while maintaining simplicity. It should avoid redundant complexity and ineffective prioritization strategies, ultimately leading to designing better heuristics.
