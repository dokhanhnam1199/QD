Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines remaining capacity and 'fullness' with a tie-breaker based on bin index.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate max capacity assuming all bins have the same max capacity\n    max_capacity = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priority = np.where(mask, \n                        -(bins_remain_cap - item) + (max_capacity - bins_remain_cap - item) / max_capacity, \n                        -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority = np.where(priority != -np.inf, \n                        priority + np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) + np.random.uniform(0, 1e-6, size=num_bins), \n                        -np.inf)\n    \n    # Normalize scores to avoid extreme values\n    finite_scores = priority[np.isfinite(priority)]\n    if len(finite_scores) > 0:\n        min_score, max_score = np.min(finite_scores), np.max(finite_scores)\n        if max_score != min_score:\n            priority[np.isfinite(priority)] = (finite_scores - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority scores for adding an item to each bin.\n    Combines effective prioritization with a robust tie-breaking strategy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Prioritize bins with just enough capacity\n    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Tie-break using a combination of remaining capacity and bin index\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority_scores = np.where(priority_scores != -np.inf, \n                               priority_scores + 0.1 * bins_remain_cap.max() - 0.1 * bins_remain_cap + np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))), \n                               -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best (Heuristics 1st) and the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that both prioritize bins with just enough capacity, but the best uses a more sophisticated utilization factor and a smaller coefficient for tie-breaking. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) uses a more complex utilization factor, while (2nd) relies on a combination of negative remaining capacity and bin utilization ratio. \n(3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) uses random noise for tie-breaking, whereas (4th) considers the proportion of remaining capacity occupied by the item. \nOverall, the top heuristics tend to use a combination of factors, including utilization, remaining capacity, and tie-breaking strategies.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's rethink the 'Current self-reflection' to avoid the pitfalls in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, tie-breaking, remaining capacity, utilization\n* **Advice**: Combine multiple factors effectively, handle edge cases, and use simple yet effective formulas for prioritization.\n* **Avoid**: Ineffective prioritization strategies, division by zero, and overly complex or concise code at the expense of clarity.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, handling edge cases, and using a balanced combination of factors for tie-breaking, we can design more efficient heuristics that outperform existing ones.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
