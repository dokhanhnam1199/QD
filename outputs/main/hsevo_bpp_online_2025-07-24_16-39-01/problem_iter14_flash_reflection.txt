**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of utilization factor, remaining capacity, and a tie-breaker, whereas the worst ones either lack a tie-breaker or use a less effective combination. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, indicating that the top two heuristics are the same. 
(3rd) vs (4th), we observe a change in the epsilon value and the tie-breaker coefficient. 
(19th) vs (20th), we see that the 19th heuristic uses a simpler tie-breaker, while the 20th uses a more complex one with normalization. 
Overall: The top heuristics tend to use a more sophisticated combination of factors and tie-breakers.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors and using effective tie-breakers, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
