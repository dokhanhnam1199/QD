Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines utilization factor and remaining capacity for prioritization with a simple tie-breaker.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate utilization factor, avoiding division by zero\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item, using a combination of utilization and remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -np.abs(utilization_factor), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index with a small coefficient\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * tie_breaker_coef)\n    \n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n* **Keywords**: \n    + Utilization\n    + Remaining capacity\n    + Tie-breaking\n    + Simplicity\n* **Advice**: \n    + Combine multiple relevant factors\n    + Use effective tie-breakers\n    + Balance prioritization and randomness\n* **Avoid**: \n    + Unnecessary complexity\n    + Excessive randomness\n    + Redundant components\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on key factors, using effective tie-breakers, and maintaining simplicity, we can design better heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, ultimately leading to improved performance.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
