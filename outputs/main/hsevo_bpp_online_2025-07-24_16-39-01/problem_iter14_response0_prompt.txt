Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines utilization factor and remaining capacity for prioritization with a simple tie-breaker.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate utilization factor, avoiding division by zero\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, 1e-9)\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item, using a combination of utilization and remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -np.abs(utilization_factor), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index with a small coefficient\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * 1e-3)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines remaining capacity and 'fullness' with a tie-breaker based on bin index and random noise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate max capacity assuming all bins have the same max capacity\n    max_capacity = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priority = np.where(mask, \n                        -(bins_remain_cap - item) + 0.1 * (max_capacity - bins_remain_cap - item) / max_capacity, \n                        -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index and random noise\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority = np.where(priority != -np.inf, \n                        priority + np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) + np.random.uniform(0, 1e-6, size=num_bins), \n                        -np.inf)\n    \n    # Normalize scores to avoid extreme values\n    finite_scores = priority[np.isfinite(priority)]\n    if len(finite_scores) > 0:\n        min_score, max_score = np.min(finite_scores), np.max(finite_scores)\n        if max_score != min_score:\n            priority[np.isfinite(priority)] = (finite_scores - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of utilization factor, remaining capacity, and a tie-breaker, whereas the worst ones either lack a tie-breaker or use a less effective combination. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, indicating that the top two heuristics are the same. \n(3rd) vs (4th), we observe a change in the epsilon value and the tie-breaker coefficient. \n(19th) vs (20th), we see that the 19th heuristic uses a simpler tie-breaker, while the 20th uses a more complex one with normalization. \nOverall: The top heuristics tend to use a more sophisticated combination of factors and tie-breakers.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Multiple factors, Tie-breaking, Simplicity\n* **Advice**: Combine relevant factors, use effective tie-breakers, and prioritize simplicity.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, ineffective tie-breaking, and overly simplistic prioritization.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, combining multiple factors, and using simple yet effective tie-breaking methods, we can create better heuristics that balance competing demands and achieve improved performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
