Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function implements the First-Fit decreasing heuristic with a twist.\n    It prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity for the item.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the priority score for each bin\n    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item\n    # So, we use the negative of the remaining capacity after adding the item\n    # If the item doesn't fit, the priority score is negative infinity\n    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)\n    \n    # To avoid division by zero and make the score more meaningful, we can add a small value to the denominator\n    # However, in this case, it's not necessary because we're not using the remaining capacity as a denominator\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's rethink 'Current self-reflection'. Since 'Ineffective self-reflection' is None, we'll focus on enhancing the current approach.\n\n* **Keywords**: prioritization, capacity, edge cases\n* **Advice**: Explore alternative prioritization strategies and robust handling of edge cases.\n* **Avoid**: Static prioritization methods and fragile edge case handling.\n* **Explanation**: By emphasizing dynamic prioritization and edge case management, we can create more effective and resilient heuristics, ultimately leading to better optimization outcomes.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
