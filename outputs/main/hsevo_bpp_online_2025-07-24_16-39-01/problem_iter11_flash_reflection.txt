**Analysis:**
Comparing the best (Heuristics 1st) and the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that both prioritize bins with just enough capacity, but the best uses a more sophisticated utilization factor and a smaller coefficient for tie-breaking. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) uses a more complex utilization factor, while (2nd) relies on a combination of negative remaining capacity and bin utilization ratio. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) uses random noise for tie-breaking, whereas (4th) considers the proportion of remaining capacity occupied by the item. 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to use a combination of factors, including utilization, remaining capacity, and tie-breaking strategies.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, combine multiple factors such as utilization, remaining capacity, and tie-breaking strategies, and consider using smaller coefficients for tie-breaking to achieve a balance between prioritization and randomness.
