To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

* The task is to come up with ideas to design better heuristics by avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection' and redefining 'Current self-reflection'.

Upon examining 'Ineffective self-reflection', common themes emerge:
- Prioritization strategies and effective tie-breaking are crucial.
- Combining multiple relevant factors is key.
- Simplicity is preferred over unnecessary complexity.

Here's the redefined 'Current self-reflection' in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Multiple Factors, Simplicity, Tie-breaking.
* **Advice**: Combine key factors like utilization and remaining capacity with simple, effective tie-breakers.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, excessive randomness, and redundant components.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on prioritization strategies, combining multiple relevant factors, and maintaining simplicity, we can design better heuristics that are both effective and efficient.
