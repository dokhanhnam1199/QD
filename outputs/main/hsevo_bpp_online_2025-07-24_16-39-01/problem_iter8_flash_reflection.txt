**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic prioritizes bins with just enough capacity and considers the remaining capacity, while the worst one also prioritizes bins with just enough capacity but with a less effective tie-breaking strategy. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both consider remaining capacity after adding the item, but the 1st heuristic uses a simpler and more effective formula. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that similar heuristics can have slight variations in their formulas, but (3rd) adds a small random noise which is beneficial. 
(19th) vs (20th) shows that using a combination of random noise and bin index for tie-breaking is common among lower-ranked heuristics, but (19th) uses a more sophisticated approach with tuned parameters.
Overall, effective prioritization and tie-breaking strategies are crucial, and top heuristics tend to use simpler, more effective formulas.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simple yet effective prioritization formulas and consider combining multiple factors (e.g., remaining capacity, bin index, and random noise) for tie-breaking.
