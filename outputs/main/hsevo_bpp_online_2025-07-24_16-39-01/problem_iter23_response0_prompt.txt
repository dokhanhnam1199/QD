Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\nepsilon = 1e-6  # Small value to avoid division by zero\ntie_breaker_coef = 1e-3  # Coefficient for the tie-breaker\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines utilization factor and fit score for prioritization with an enhanced tie-breaker.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate utilization factor and fit score\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    fit_score = 1 - (item / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon))\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item, using a combination of utilization and fit score\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -np.abs(utilization_factor) - fit_score * 0.1, -np.inf)\n    \n    # Enhanced tie-breaker based on bin index\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * tie_breaker_coef)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines utilization factor and fit score with a tie-breaker for effective prioritization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    epsilon = 1e-6  # Avoid division by zero\n    tie_breaker_coef = 1e-3  # Coefficient for tie-breaker\n    \n    # Calculate utilization factor and fit score\n    relative_size = item / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    fit_score = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 - relative_size, 0)\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, \n                        # Combine utilization factor and fit score\n                        0.5 * utilization_factor + 0.5 * fit_score, \n                        -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * tie_breaker_coef)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines utilization factor and remaining capacity with a simple tie-breaker, while the worst relies on a more complex combination of remaining capacity, utilization factor, and a sophisticated tie-breaker. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, suggesting that the top two heuristics are the same. \n(3rd) vs (4th) also shows identical code, indicating a pattern of duplicate top heuristics. \nComparing (5th) vs (6th), we observe that both use fit score and tie-breaker, but (6th) adds random noise. \n(19th) vs (20th) shows that both use a combination of factors, but (20th) has a more complex tie-breaker. \nOverall, top heuristics tend to use a balanced combination of utilization factor, remaining capacity, and simple tie-breakers, while worse heuristics tend to introduce more complexity or randomness.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n* **Keywords**: \n    + Utilization\n    + Remaining capacity\n    + Tie-breaking\n    + Simplicity\n* **Advice**: \n    + Combine multiple relevant factors\n    + Use effective tie-breakers\n    + Balance prioritization and randomness\n* **Avoid**: \n    + Unnecessary complexity\n    + Excessive randomness\n    + Redundant components\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on key factors, using effective tie-breakers, and maintaining simplicity, we can design better heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, ultimately leading to improved performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
