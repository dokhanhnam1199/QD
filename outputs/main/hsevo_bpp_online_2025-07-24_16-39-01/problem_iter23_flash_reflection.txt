**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines utilization factor and remaining capacity with a simple tie-breaker, while the worst relies on a more complex combination of remaining capacity, utilization factor, and a sophisticated tie-breaker. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, suggesting that the top two heuristics are the same. 
(3rd) vs (4th) also shows identical code, indicating a pattern of duplicate top heuristics. 
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), we observe that both use fit score and tie-breaker, but (6th) adds random noise. 
(19th) vs (20th) shows that both use a combination of factors, but (20th) has a more complex tie-breaker. 
Overall, top heuristics tend to use a balanced combination of utilization factor, remaining capacity, and simple tie-breakers, while worse heuristics tend to introduce more complexity or randomness.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining key factors like utilization and remaining capacity with simple, effective tie-breakers, and avoid unnecessary complexity or excessive randomness.
