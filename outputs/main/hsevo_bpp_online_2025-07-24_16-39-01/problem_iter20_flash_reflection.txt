**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st and 2nd) with the worst (19th and 20th), we see that the top heuristics use a more refined utilization factor calculation and a tie-breaker based on bin index. The worst heuristics introduce additional complexity with multiple factors and random noise. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical code, indicating potential redundancy or overfitting in the ranking. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows a shift from a simpler utilization and remaining capacity calculation to a more complex scoring system. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see identical code again, similar to the top two. 
Overall, effective heuristics seem to balance simplicity with a thoughtful tie-breaker mechanism.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simplicity and an effective tie-breaker. Avoid redundant complexity and ensure that each component of the heuristic serves a clear purpose.
