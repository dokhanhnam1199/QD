**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we observe that the top heuristic prioritizes bins with just enough capacity for the item, using `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` for valid bins. In contrast, the worst heuristic normalizes the scores, which may not be necessary. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both prioritize bins with less remaining capacity after addition, but (1st) directly uses the negative remaining capacity. (3rd) vs (4th), (3rd) adds a small random noise to break ties, while (4th) doesn't. Overall, effective prioritization and handling of edge cases are key to a good heuristic.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on effective prioritization strategies, such as using negative remaining capacity or inverse remaining capacity, and consider handling edge cases like division by zero and tie-breaking.
