To design better heuristics, let's rethink the 'Current self-reflection' to avoid the pitfalls in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach:

* **Keywords**: Prioritization, tie-breaking, remaining capacity, utilization
* **Advice**: Combine multiple factors effectively, handle edge cases, and use simple yet effective formulas for prioritization.
* **Avoid**: Ineffective prioritization strategies, division by zero, and overly complex or concise code at the expense of clarity.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, handling edge cases, and using a balanced combination of factors for tie-breaking, we can design more efficient heuristics that outperform existing ones.
