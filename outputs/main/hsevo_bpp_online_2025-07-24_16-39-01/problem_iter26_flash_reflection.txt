**Analysis:**
Comparing the top-ranked heuristics (1st) with the lower-ranked ones (e.g., 19th, 20th), we see that the top heuristics tend to have more complex priority calculations involving multiple factors like utilization factor, fit score, and tie-breakers. 
(1st) vs (20th), we notice that (1st) uses a combination of utilization factor and fit score with specific weights, while (20th) uses a simpler post-utilization factor and remaining capacity calculation.
(2nd) to (5th) are identical to (1st), suggesting that the exact same heuristic is considered top-ranked multiple times, potentially indicating its robustness or overfitting to the evaluation criteria.
Comparing (6th) to (8th) and others, we see variations in how the priority is calculated, with some using more straightforward methods and others incorporating additional factors like waste factor or randomness for tie-breaking.
Overall, top heuristics tend to balance multiple factors for bin selection and often include a tie-breaker mechanism.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on balancing multiple relevant factors (e.g., utilization, fit, waste) and incorporate effective tie-breaker mechanisms. Experiment with different weightings and combinations of these factors to optimize performance.
