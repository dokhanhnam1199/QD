Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function implements a heuristic that prioritizes bins based on their remaining capacity and utilization.\n    It combines the factors of having just enough capacity for the item and the overall utilization of the bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the priority score for each bin\n    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item\n    # and also have a high overall utilization\n    \n    # First, filter out bins that cannot fit the item\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # For valid bins, calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remaining_after_addition = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n    \n    # Calculate the utilization of the bin after adding the item\n    # Assuming the bin capacity is 1.0 (or normalize it to 1.0)\n    bin_utilization_after_addition = (1.0 - remaining_after_addition) / 1.0\n    \n    # Priority score is a combination of the negative remaining capacity (to prioritize bins with just enough capacity)\n    # and the bin utilization after adding the item (to prioritize bins that are more full)\n    priority_scores_valid = -remaining_after_addition + bin_utilization_after_addition\n    \n    # Create an array to store the priority scores for all bins\n    priority_scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Assign the calculated priority scores to the valid bins\n    priority_scores[valid_bins] = priority_scores_valid\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority scores for adding an item to bins, combining remaining capacity, \n    utilization factor, and a simple tie-breaker based on bin index.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate priority score as a combination of negative remaining capacity \n    # after addition and the proportion of the remaining capacity that the item occupies\n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    priority_scores = np.where(\n        bins_remain_cap >= item, \n        -(remaining_cap_after_addition) + (item / bins_remain_cap), \n        -np.inf\n    )\n    \n    # Add a simple tie-breaker based on bin index to favor earlier bins\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority_scores = np.where(priority_scores != -np.inf, \n                               priority_scores + np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))), \n                               -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of utilization factor, remaining capacity, and a tie-breaker, whereas the worst ones either lack a tie-breaker or use a less effective combination. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, indicating that the top two heuristics are the same. \n(3rd) vs (4th), we observe a change in the epsilon value and the tie-breaker coefficient. \n(19th) vs (20th), we see that the 19th heuristic uses a simpler tie-breaker, while the 20th uses a more complex one with normalization. \nOverall: The top heuristics tend to use a more sophisticated combination of factors and tie-breakers.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Multiple factors, Tie-breaking, Simplicity\n* **Advice**: Combine relevant factors, use effective tie-breakers, and prioritize simplicity.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, ineffective tie-breaking, and overly simplistic prioritization.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, combining multiple factors, and using simple yet effective tie-breaking methods, we can create better heuristics that balance competing demands and achieve improved performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
