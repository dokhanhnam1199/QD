In contrast, the lower-ranked heuristics, while similar in structure, either lack the fine-tuning of coefficients or simplify certain aspects of the calculation. For instance, comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the top heuristic has optimized coefficients for its tie-breaker and weighted factors, suggesting the importance of these optimizations. (3rd) vs (4th) and other subsequent pairs show a gradual simplification or less optimal tuning of these elements. Notably, the worst heuristics (19th and 20th) are nearly identical and lack the nuanced weighting seen in the top heuristics. Overall, the key differentiators among the top heuristics are the sophistication of their tie-breakers and the weighting of their scoring factors.\n- \nTo redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information and identify key aspects.\n\n* Keywords: nuanced scoring, weighted factors, robust optimization, tie-breakers, utilization, fit score, remaining capacity.\n* Advice: Combine multiple relevant factors (utilization, fit score, remaining capacity) and use effective tie-breakers (bin index, randomness) with robust optimization methods to fine-tune coefficients.\n* Avoid: Unnecessary complexity, excessive randomness, redundant components, and ineffective prioritization strategies.\n* Explanation: By incorporating multiple factors and using effective tie-breakers with robust optimization, we can create a more balanced and efficient heuristic that avoids common pitfalls like complexity and inefficiency.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
