To improve the 'Current self-reflection' and design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. 

* **Keywords**: simplicity, effective tie-breaker, prioritization, multiple factors, remaining capacity, bin fullness, randomness.
* **Advice**: Combine multiple factors (e.g., remaining capacity, utilization, bin index) and use effective tie-breaking strategies. Consider simplicity and clear purpose for each component.
* **Avoid**: Redundant complexity, unnecessary components, division by zero, and ineffective tie-breaking methods.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity, combining relevant factors, and using effective tie-breakers, we can create more efficient heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, ultimately leading to better performance.
