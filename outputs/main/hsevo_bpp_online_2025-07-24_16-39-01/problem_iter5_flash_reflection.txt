**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see both prioritize bins with just enough capacity and use random noise to break ties, but the 1st is more concise. 
(2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd considers both remaining capacity and 'fullness' of bins, while the 19th only uses negative remaining capacity; 
(1st) vs (2nd), the 1st is simpler and more efficient. 
Overall: The top heuristics are concise, consider multiple factors, and effectively break ties.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on concise code, consider multiple factors like remaining capacity and bin fullness, and use effective tie-breaking methods.
