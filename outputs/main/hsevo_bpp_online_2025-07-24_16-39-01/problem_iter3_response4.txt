def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements a dynamic prioritization strategy that considers both the remaining capacity and the "fullness" of the bins.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item and are relatively full
    # So, we use a combination of the negative of the remaining capacity after adding the item and the current fullness of the bin
    # If the item doesn't fit, the priority score is negative infinity
    max_cap = np.max(bins_remain_cap) + item  # assuming all bins have the same capacity
    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item) + (max_cap - bins_remain_cap - item) / max_cap, -np.inf)
