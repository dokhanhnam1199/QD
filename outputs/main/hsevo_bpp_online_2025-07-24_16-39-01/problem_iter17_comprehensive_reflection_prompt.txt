{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on balancing multiple factors like utilization and remaining capacity, and use simple yet effective tie-breakers based on bin index or other relevant characteristics.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on effective prioritization strategies, such as using negative remaining capacity or inverse remaining capacity, and consider handling edge cases like division by zero and tie-breaking.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on concise code, consider multiple factors like remaining capacity and bin fullness, and use effective tie-breaking methods.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simple yet effective prioritization formulas and consider combining multiple factors (e.g., remaining capacity, bin index, and random noise) for tie-breaking.\n\nTo design better heuristics, combine multiple factors such as utilization, remaining capacity, and tie-breaking strategies, and consider using smaller coefficients for tie-breaking to achieve a balance between prioritization and randomness.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors and using effective tie-breakers, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
