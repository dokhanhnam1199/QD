**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) vs the worst (20th), we see that top heuristics tend to have a more nuanced combination of utilization factor and fit score, with subtle differences in weighting and tie-breaking mechanisms. The top heuristics also tend to favor bins that are almost full to minimize waste. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the main difference is in the choice of weights and epsilon value. (2nd) has more precise weights, suggesting that fine-tuning these parameters can lead to improved performance. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that introducing additional parameters can be beneficial, but (4th) has a more complex function signature. Comparing (19th) vs (20th), we see that they are identical, suggesting that there may be some redundancy in the list. Overall, the top heuristics tend to have a balance between utilization factor, fit score, and tie-breaking mechanisms.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on fine-tuning the weights and epsilon values for utilization factor and fit score, and incorporate effective tie-breaking mechanisms that consider bin index and remaining capacity, while also favoring bins that are almost full to minimize waste.
