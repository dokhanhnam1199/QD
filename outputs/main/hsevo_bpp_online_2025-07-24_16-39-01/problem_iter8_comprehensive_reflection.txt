To redesign 'Current self-reflection,' let's analyze the given information and reframe it to avoid the pitfalls mentioned in 'Ineffective self-reflection.' Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Analysis
- The 'Current self-reflection' focuses on simple prioritization formulas and tie-breaking using multiple factors.
- The 'Ineffective self-reflection' suggests looking into more effective prioritization strategies and handling edge cases.

### Redefined 'Current self-reflection'
To design better heuristics, consider the following:
* **Keywords**: Effective prioritization, multiple factors, edge cases.
* **Advice**: Focus on strategies like negative or inverse remaining capacity and implement robust tie-breaking.
* **Avoid**: Simple, non-effective prioritization and lack of edge case handling.
* **Explanation**: Combining effective prioritization strategies with robust handling of edge cases like division by zero and ties will lead to better heuristics.

Let's refine our approach with these insights. I'm ready to help design better heuristics.
