To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Multiple factors, Tie-breaking, Simplicity
* **Advice**: Combine relevant factors, use effective tie-breakers, and prioritize simplicity.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, ineffective tie-breaking, and overly simplistic prioritization.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, combining multiple factors, and using simple yet effective tie-breaking methods, we can create better heuristics that balance competing demands and achieve improved performance.
