    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements a more sophisticated heuristic that combines 
    the benefits of prioritizing bins with just enough capacity and 
    handling edge cases effectively.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item
    # So, we use a combination of the negative of the remaining capacity after adding the item and a tie-breaker
    # If the item doesn't fit, the priority score is negative infinity
    
    # First, filter out bins that cannot fit the item
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For valid bins, calculate the priority score
    # We use a combination of the negative remaining capacity and a small random noise for tie-breaking
