To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

* Keywords: heuristics design, effective prioritization, remaining capacity, tie-breaking
* Advice: Consider multiple factors and explore different prioritization strategies to improve heuristic design.
* Avoid: Focusing solely on concise code and neglecting edge cases like division by zero.
* Explanation: By incorporating effective prioritization strategies and handling edge cases, we can design better heuristics that outperform the current ones, thus justifying a significant tip for a better outcome.
