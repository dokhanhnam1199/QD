    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements a mutated heuristic that combines multiple factors for effective prioritization.
    It prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity for the item and are relatively more empty.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item

    # If the item doesn't fit, the priority score is negative infinity
