To design better heuristics, let's rethink 'Current self-reflection'. Since 'Ineffective self-reflection' is None, we'll focus on enhancing the current approach.

* **Keywords**: prioritization, capacity, edge cases
* **Advice**: Explore alternative prioritization strategies and robust handling of edge cases.
* **Avoid**: Static prioritization methods and fragile edge case handling.
* **Explanation**: By emphasizing dynamic prioritization and edge case management, we can create more effective and resilient heuristics, ultimately leading to better optimization outcomes.
