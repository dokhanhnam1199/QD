**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) and the worst heuristic (20th), we see that both use a combination of factors like utilization and remaining capacity, but the best heuristic uses a more straightforward tie-breaker based on bin index. Comparing the 2nd and 19th, we notice similar patterns. The top heuristics tend to have simpler, more effective tie-breakers. Comparing the 1st and 2nd, we see identical implementations, suggesting that the top-performing heuristics share common characteristics. Overall, effective heuristics balance multiple factors and use simple, effective tie-breakers.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on balancing multiple factors like utilization and remaining capacity, and use simple yet effective tie-breakers based on bin index or other relevant characteristics.
