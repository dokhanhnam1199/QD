To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

### Analysis
The 'Current self-reflection' focuses on balancing multiple factors and using simple tie-breakers. However, 'Ineffective self-reflection' provides various strategies that can be used to improve it.

### Redefining 'Current self-reflection'
Here's a redefined version in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Tie-breaking, Multiple factors, Balance
* **Advice**: Combine multiple relevant factors (e.g., utilization, remaining capacity) and use effective tie-breakers (e.g., bin index, random noise) with smaller coefficients to achieve a balance.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, division by zero, and ineffective prioritization strategies.
* **Explanation**: By considering multiple factors and using effective tie-breakers, we can design better heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, leading to improved performance.
