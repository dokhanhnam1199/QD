Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function implements a more sophisticated heuristic that combines multiple factors for effective prioritization.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # For bins that have enough capacity, calculate the priority score\n    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item (to maximize utilization)\n    # and also consider the absolute remaining capacity (to avoid leaving too much empty space)\n    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, \n                               -(np.abs(remaining_cap_after_addition)) +  # prioritize bins with just enough capacity\n                               0.01 * bins_remain_cap,  # slightly prioritize bins with more remaining capacity\n                               -np.inf)  # bins that can't fit the item get -inf priority\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority scores for adding an item to bins, combining remaining capacity, \n    utilization factor, and a simple tie-breaker based on bin index.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate priority score as a combination of negative remaining capacity \n    # after addition and the proportion of the remaining capacity that the item occupies\n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    priority_scores = np.where(\n        bins_remain_cap >= item, \n        -(remaining_cap_after_addition) + (item / bins_remain_cap), \n        -np.inf\n    )\n    \n    # Add a simple tie-breaker based on bin index to favor earlier bins\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority_scores = np.where(priority_scores != -np.inf, \n                               priority_scores + np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))), \n                               -np.inf)\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of utilization factor, remaining capacity, and a tie-breaker, whereas the worst ones either lack a tie-breaker or use a less effective combination. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, indicating that the top two heuristics are the same. \n(3rd) vs (4th), we observe a change in the epsilon value and the tie-breaker coefficient. \n(19th) vs (20th), we see that the 19th heuristic uses a simpler tie-breaker, while the 20th uses a more complex one with normalization. \nOverall: The top heuristics tend to use a more sophisticated combination of factors and tie-breakers.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Multiple factors, Tie-breaking, Simplicity\n* **Advice**: Combine relevant factors, use effective tie-breakers, and prioritize simplicity.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, ineffective tie-breaking, and overly simplistic prioritization.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on effective prioritization, combining multiple factors, and using simple yet effective tie-breaking methods, we can create better heuristics that balance competing demands and achieve improved performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
