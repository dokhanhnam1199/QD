Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines utilization factor and remaining capacity for prioritization with a simple tie-breaker.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate utilization factor, avoiding division by zero\n    utilization_factor = (bins_remain_cap - item) / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item, using a combination of utilization and remaining capacity\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -np.abs(utilization_factor), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Add a tie-breaker based on bin index with a small coefficient\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * tie_breaker_coef)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\nepsilon = 1e-6  # Small value to avoid division by zero\ntie_breaker_coef = 1e-3  # Coefficient for the tie-breaker\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Enhanced prioritization function that considers both the fit of the item to the bin and the bin's remaining capacity,\n    with a sophisticated tie-breaking mechanism based on both bin index and remaining capacity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate a score that reflects how well the item fits into the bin, avoiding division by zero\n    fit_score = 1 - (item / np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon))\n    \n    # Calculate a normalized remaining capacity score to encourage packing items tightly\n    remain_cap_score = bins_remain_cap / (item + epsilon)\n    \n    # Priority score for bins that can fit the item, combining fit score and remaining capacity score\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -fit_score + remain_cap_score * 0.1, -np.inf)\n    \n    # Enhanced tie-breaking based on both bin index and remaining capacity to diversify bin selection\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    tie_breaker = (np.log(num_bins / (1 + np.arange(num_bins))) * tie_breaker_coef) + (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap) * tie_breaker_coef * 0.1)\n    priority += (bins_remain_cap >= item) * tie_breaker\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristic (1st) and the worst heuristic (20th), we see that both use a combination of factors like utilization and remaining capacity, but the best heuristic uses a more straightforward tie-breaker based on bin index. Comparing the 2nd and 19th, we notice similar patterns. The top heuristics tend to have simpler, more effective tie-breakers. Comparing the 1st and 2nd, we see identical implementations, suggesting that the top-performing heuristics share common characteristics. Overall, effective heuristics balance multiple factors and use simple, effective tie-breakers.\n- \nTo redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.\n\n### Analysis\nThe 'Current self-reflection' focuses on balancing multiple factors and using simple tie-breakers. However, 'Ineffective self-reflection' provides various strategies that can be used to improve it.\n\n### Redefining 'Current self-reflection'\nHere's a redefined version in 4 bullet points:\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, Tie-breaking, Multiple factors, Balance\n* **Advice**: Combine multiple relevant factors (e.g., utilization, remaining capacity) and use effective tie-breakers (e.g., bin index, random noise) with smaller coefficients to achieve a balance.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, division by zero, and ineffective prioritization strategies.\n* **Explanation**: By considering multiple factors and using effective tie-breakers, we can design better heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, leading to improved performance.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
