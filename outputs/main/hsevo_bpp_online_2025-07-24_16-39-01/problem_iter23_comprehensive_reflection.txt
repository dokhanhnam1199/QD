To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information. Here are the key takeaways:

* **Keywords**: 
    + Utilization
    + Remaining capacity
    + Tie-breaking
    + Simplicity
* **Advice**: 
    + Combine multiple relevant factors
    + Use effective tie-breakers
    + Balance prioritization and randomness
* **Avoid**: 
    + Unnecessary complexity
    + Excessive randomness
    + Redundant components
* **Explanation**: By focusing on key factors, using effective tie-breakers, and maintaining simplicity, we can design better heuristics that balance prioritization and randomness, ultimately leading to improved performance.
