**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st version uses `waste_normalized` (waste as a *portion* of remaining capacity) and `relative_fullness` (a measure of how full the bin *was*), which seems to provide a more nuanced priority than the `fit_score` and `is_used_bonus` of the 2nd, which is based on absolute difference.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses direct inverse of the remaining capacity after the fit, prioritizing snug fits with a specific boost for very tight fits. It uses explicit loops. Whereas, 4th is similar to the 1st and vectorised, normalizing waste.
*   Comparing (5th) vs (6th), the 5th uses a weighted sum of `fit_priority`, `remaining_cap_penalty`, and `utilization_priority`. The 6th prioritizes based on normalized waste and relative fullness. The key difference is the weighted combination of multiple explicit heuristics versus a more direct calculation.
*   Comparing (7th) vs (8th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.
*   Comparing (9th) vs (10th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.
*   Comparing (11th) vs (12th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.
*   Comparing (13th) vs (14th), we observe a significant shift in sophistication. The 13th focuses on a basic ratio of item size to bin size, adding a term for waste. In contrast, the 14th employs a more complex approach, including a fragmentation penalty and a random factor.
*   Comparing (15th) vs (16th), the 15th re-implements the 14th. The 16th uses "potential energy" to choose bins and avoids trivial fills.
*   Comparing (17th) vs (18th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.
*   Comparing (19th) vs (20th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (19th) applies scaling factors on different equations that mimic physics to compute priorities, while the (20th) re-implements the (19th).
* Overall: The better heuristics balance several factors (fit, fullness, waste), and *normalize* values to comparable scales. The use of np.inf to strongly discourage invalid moves (item doesn't fit) is consistently good. The very best heuristics, use `numpy` effectively for vectorized calculations, rather than explicit loops. The worst heuristics either don't handle edge cases, have very complex formulas that don't result in improvements, or apply no penalty for overfill. Simpler, normalized approaches seem to outperform complex, multi-factor equations.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, prioritize clear, easily interpretable factors like relative waste and fullness. Normalize inputs to a common scale and use vectorization for speed. Explicitly penalize infeasible moves with -inf. Simplicity and good handling of edge cases are better than overly complex formulas.
