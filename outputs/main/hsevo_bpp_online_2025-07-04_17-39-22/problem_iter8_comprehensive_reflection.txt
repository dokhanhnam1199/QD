Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to focus on designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection," and building on the provided ideas.

Here's a revised approach, aimed at generating more actionable advice:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive parameters, exploration-exploitation balance, edge case handling, hyperparameter tuning, problem state awareness.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust their behavior based on real-time problem characteristics. Focus on creating tunable parameters that influence the balance between exploration and exploitation.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex formulas that obscure interpretability, neglecting edge cases.

*   **Explanation:** Prioritize heuristics that "sense" the problem state (e.g., bin fill levels) and respond accordingly. This allows for tailored behavior, avoiding rigid rules that perform poorly in certain scenarios.
