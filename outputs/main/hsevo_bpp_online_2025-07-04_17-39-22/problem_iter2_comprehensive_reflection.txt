Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective for designing better heuristics, keeping in mind the goal of avoiding ineffective practices (which are currently undefined, so we'll focus on generally good practices).

Here's a breakdown to guide the redefined self-reflection process:

*   **Keywords:** *Adaptive, Iterative, Modular, Validation, Experimentation.*

*   **Advice:** Focus on iterative refinement through experimentation. Design heuristics as modular components, enabling easy modification and combination. Continuously validate performance against benchmarks and adapt based on results.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, rigid designs, relying solely on intuition without empirical validation, ignoring problem-specific characteristics.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static, predefined heuristics. Embrace an adaptive approach where the heuristic's parameters or structure can be adjusted based on feedback from the search process or the problem instance itself. Modular design allows for easier testing and combination of different heuristic components. Rigorous validation is crucial to ensure the heuristic consistently improves performance.
