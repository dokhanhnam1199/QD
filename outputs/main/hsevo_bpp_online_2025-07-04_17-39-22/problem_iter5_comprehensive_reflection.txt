Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design, keeping in mind the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection" and aiming for actionable insights.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, dynamic balance, constraint awareness, robustification.

*   **Advice:** Focus on developing heuristics that *dynamically adapt* their behavior based on the current state of the bin packing problem. Consider adaptive weighting schemes and methods to intelligently switch between exploration and exploitation phases.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, static approaches based solely on easily interpretable factors. Avoid premature optimization for speed at the expense of solution quality and flexibility. Don't rely *only* on penalizing infeasibility with -inf; seek methods to prevent infeasibility.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need adaptability and robustness. Move beyond simple greediness and static parameters. Explicitly address constraint handling *before* infeasibility occurs, and allow the heuristic to adjust its strategies based on the problem's progress.
