**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of capacity ratio, fragment avoidance, exploration noise, and bonuses/penalties based on item size and bin fullness. The worst heuristic prioritizes utilization and waste with adaptive exploration and penalties for small items and large items in empty bins.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the second best employs similar logic to the best, but with different coefficients, and a more detailed breakdown of parameters. The second worst combines waste normalization, bin utilization, and adaptive exploration.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) uses more hyperparameter tuning with very specific values which may indicate it was more tuned to the dataset. (2nd) has cleaner documentation.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that (3rd) uses hardcoded parameters, while (4th) introduces dynamic calculations for parameters like `randomness_scale` based on `max_capacity_used` and `exploration_boost` based on `avg_fill_level` - implying adaptivity is better.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (20th) has a penalty for placing large items in relatively empty bins, an attempt to avoid a specific undesirable outcome whereas (14th) lacks this specific edge case handling, suggesting importance of edge case handling.
Overall: the better heuristics use more nuanced and adaptive methods for exploration/exploitation and edge case handling (fragmentation, bin fullness, large items) and well-tuned hyperparameters, while the worse heuristics rely on simpler calculations and fixed parameters.

**Experience:**

For improved heuristics, focus on adaptive exploration/exploitation based on the solution state, dynamic parameter adjustment instead of hardcoded values, and comprehensive edge case handling with smooth transitions. Thorough hyperparameter tuning matters.
