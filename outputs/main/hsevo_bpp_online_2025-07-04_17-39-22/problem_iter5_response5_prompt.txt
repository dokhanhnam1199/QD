Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # A bin must have enough capacity to accommodate the item. Otherwise the priority should be very low.\n    infeasible_mask = bins_remain_cap < item\n    priorities[infeasible_mask] = -np.inf  # Make infeasible bins have the lowest priority.\n\n    # Encourage bins that fit the item *relatively* well (but not too perfectly, to avoid small remaining spaces).\n\n    feasible_mask = ~infeasible_mask\n    remaining_capacity_after_fit = bins_remain_cap[feasible_mask] - item\n    capacity_ratio = item / bins_remain_cap[feasible_mask]  # ratio of item size to bin capacity\n\n    # Priority is high if the capacity ratio is high AND the remaining space is small *relative* to the item\n    # This favors using most of the bin's space without creating *very* small fragments.\n\n    priorities[feasible_mask] = capacity_ratio * np.exp(-remaining_capacity_after_fit / (item + 1e-9))\n\n    # Introduce some randomness to break ties and explore the search space more effectively.\n    priorities += np.random.normal(0, 0.01, size=len(priorities))\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines best aspects of previous heuristics for improved bin packing.\"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate how much space would be left in each bin if the item were placed\n    fit_score = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Prioritize bins where the item fits, penalize others harshly\n    fit_priority = np.where(fit_score >= 0, np.exp(-np.abs(fit_score)), -np.inf)\n\n    # Normalize remaining capacity to a [0,1] scale, higher value for near-full bins\n    remaining_normalized = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    remaining_normalized[fit_score >= 0] = 1 - (fit_score[fit_score >= 0] / bins_remain_cap[fit_score >= 0])\n\n    # Combine fit proximity with remaining capacity using a weighted sum.\n    priorities = 0.8 * fit_priority + 0.2 * remaining_normalized\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic introduces randomness to break ties, while the 20th does not directly address tie-breaking, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions; (2nd best) vs (second worst) 2nd heuristic combines fit score and used bin bonus and normalizes waste, while heuristic 19th focuses on normalized waste and encourages fuller bins. The former could be better as It explicitly encourages re-using partially filled bins; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic explicitly penalizes infeasible bins by assigning a very low priority to them. The 2nd heuristic does the same thing, both ensure that the algorithm avoids considering bins that cannot accommodate the item; (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd heuristic calculates normalized waste and relative fullness without using fixed weights but hardcoded calculation, while the 4th uses weights that may have been optimized. This allows for better weighting between different factors; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that heuristic 19th includes a clipping function to ensure the remaining capacity after placement is no less than zero, while heuristic 20th does not have this clipping function. Overall:\n\n- The best heuristics incorporate randomness to avoid local optima.\n- Normalizing waste and rewarding fuller bins often lead to better results.\n- The use of an explicit infeasibility mask to avoid considering bins that are not feasible is critical.\n- Optimized weights provide the flexibility to find the best combination of factors.\n- It is important to clip the remaining capacity after placement to be no less than zero to avoid generating error.\n- Penalizing almost-full bins more harshly to avoid creating tiny slivers of space appears beneficial.\n- Scaling penalties and bonuses by item size allows for adaptive behavior.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective for heuristic design, keeping in mind the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\" and aiming for actionable insights.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, dynamic balance, constraint awareness, robustification.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on developing heuristics that *dynamically adapt* their behavior based on the current state of the bin packing problem. Consider adaptive weighting schemes and methods to intelligently switch between exploration and exploitation phases.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, static approaches based solely on easily interpretable factors. Avoid premature optimization for speed at the expense of solution quality and flexibility. Don't rely *only* on penalizing infeasibility with -inf; seek methods to prevent infeasibility.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need adaptability and robustness. Move beyond simple greediness and static parameters. Explicitly address constraint handling *before* infeasibility occurs, and allow the heuristic to adjust its strategies based on the problem's progress.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
