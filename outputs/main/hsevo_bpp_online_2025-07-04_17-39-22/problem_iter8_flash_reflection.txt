**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first prioritizes capacity ratio, small fragment avoidance, and large capacity bonus, along with adaptive exploration/exploitation based on the number of feasible bins. The last one combines fit score, normalized waste, and randomness. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second allows for fine-grained control over various aspects like fragment thresholds and penalties, and adaptive randomness. The last function in the list is rather basic, only looking at waste, fit, and a bit of noise. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the 1st uses hardcoded values while the 2nd exposes hyperparameters for tuning, allowing for more flexibility. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that the 3rd version incorporates an adaptive penalty for near-full bins, encourages packing items of similar sizes, dynamic noise injection. (second worst) vs (worst) indicates the second worst approach attempts waste normalization and bin utilization; the worst approach focuses on fit, remaining capacity, and randomness in a more direct manner. Overall: The better heuristics have more adaptive strategies (adaptive exploration/exploitation, dynamic penalties/bonuses based on bin utilization, remaining capacity, or item size). They also try to balance multiple factors (fit, waste, fullness) and introduce randomness for exploration. The poorer heuristics often use simpler combinations of fit, waste, and randomness, without adapting to the state of the bins.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider making them adaptive by incorporating parameters that adjust based on the problem state (e.g., bin utilization). Balance exploration and exploitation. Explicitly address edge cases like small fragments and near-full bins. Expose hyperparameters for tuning to allow adapting heuristic behavior to new problem instances.
