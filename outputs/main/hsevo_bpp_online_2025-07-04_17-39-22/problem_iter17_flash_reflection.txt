**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st includes `bin_utilization_exponent`, `item_size_threshold_ratio`, and `large_item_bonus` whereas 20th does not. The 1st calculates `capacity_ratio = item / feasible_bins_remain_cap`, whereas the 20th uses `capacity_ratio = item / (feasible_bins_remain_cap + item)`. The first utilizes `capacity_ratio**bin_utilization_exponent` to encourage bins that fit items well, providing non-linear scaling. The 20th uses `priorities[feasible_mask] = capacity_ratio`.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see that the 2nd includes `bin_utilization_exponent`, `item_size_threshold_ratio`, and `large_item_bonus` whereas 19th does not. The 2nd calculates `capacity_ratio = item / feasible_bins_remain_cap`, whereas the 19th uses `capacity_ratio = item / (feasible_bins_remain_cap + item)`.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd introduces `well_utilized_threshold` as the threshold for bin utilization and changes the way it is calculated in a bonus condition. 3rd also includes more arguments such as `well_utilized_threshold`.

Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), 19th and 20th are identical.

Overall: The top performing heuristics include `bin_utilization_exponent`, `item_size_threshold_ratio`, and `large_item_bonus`. They normalize the capacity ratio by `item / feasible_bins_remain_cap`. An important aspect of better heuristics is the non-linear scaling of the capacity ratio with a `bin_utilization_exponent`. The adaptive adjustment of exploration vs. exploitation based on the number of feasible bins is also a critical feature.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider non-linear scaling of key ratios using exponents and adaptive exploration/exploitation strategies based on problem state. Also, normalizing against remaining capacity alone seems to perform better. Adding bonuses or penalties based on thresholds for utilization yields better results.
