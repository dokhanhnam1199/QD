Okay, I understand. We need to redefine "current self-reflection" to be more effective for designing better heuristics, while explicitly avoiding the pitfalls of "ineffective self-reflection." Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Problem-State, Balance, Simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that adapt to the current problem state, finding the right balance between exploration and exploitation. Start with a simple, interpretable core and add complexity judiciously.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex formulas, hardcoded values, and ignoring edge cases. Don't neglect clear interpretability in favor of minor improvements.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to be agile and responsive to the challenges of the problem. Keep it understandable and tunable. Focus on meaningful factors, scaling parameters, and balancing randomness and greed.
