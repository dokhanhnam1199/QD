Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" aimed at designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Multi-Factor, Exploration/Exploitation Balance, Problem State Awareness.
*   **Advice:** Combine relevant factors adaptively, adjusting parameters based on problem state. Control randomness for exploration. Prioritize balancing exploration and exploitation.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex formulas, ignoring problem-specific constraints, and premature optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Good heuristics require understanding the problem's nuances, combining multiple informative factors, and strategically adjusting behavior dynamically.
