Analyze performance bottlenecks and tailor adjustments accordingly.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, over-reliance on intuition without empirical validation, generic solutions failing to adapt to specific problem characteristics.\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritize data-driven decisions. Base heuristic refinement on performance evaluation against specific problem instances rather than assumptions. Complexity should only be added if demonstrably beneficial.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
