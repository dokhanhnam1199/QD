{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and adaptively adjusting parameters based on the problem state. Introducing randomness can help with exploration, but it should be controlled. Also, balancing exploration and exploitation is critical for good performance.\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider incorporating randomness, normalizing waste, penalizing infeasible solutions, tuning weights, and preventing overflow/underflow by clipping the results. Adaptive scaling can be beneficial. It's important to balance exploration (randomness) and exploitation (greediness).\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize clear, easily interpretable factors like relative waste and fullness. Normalize inputs to a common scale and use vectorization for speed. Explicitly penalize infeasible moves with -inf. Simplicity and good handling of edge cases are better than overly complex formulas.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider making them adaptive by incorporating parameters that adjust based on the problem state (e.g., bin utilization). Balance exploration and exploitation. Explicitly address edge cases like small fragments and near-full bins. Expose hyperparameters for tuning to allow adapting heuristic behavior to new problem instances.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a simple, intuitive core (e.g., normalized waste, bin utilization). Add complexity gradually, and carefully test each addition. Avoid over-engineering by focusing on a few key factors and scaling noise with item size and # feasible bins.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
