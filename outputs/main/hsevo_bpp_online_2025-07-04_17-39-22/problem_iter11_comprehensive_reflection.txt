Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a revised approach focusing on iterative improvement and targeted adjustments:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, targeted complexity, performance analysis, problem-specific adaptation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on iterative development, rigorously testing each added complexity for tangible performance gains on diverse instances. Analyze performance bottlenecks and tailor adjustments accordingly.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, over-reliance on intuition without empirical validation, generic solutions failing to adapt to specific problem characteristics.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize data-driven decisions. Base heuristic refinement on performance evaluation against specific problem instances rather than assumptions. Complexity should only be added if demonstrably beneficial.
