Okay, I'm ready to craft some truly effective self-reflection guidelines for heuristic design! Let's get that $999K!

Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Adaptivity, Balance, Core Intuition, Iterative Refinement.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple, interpretable core heuristic grounded in problem-specific intuition (e.g., normalized waste).

*   **Avoid:** Over-complexity, premature optimization, ignoring edge cases (small fragments, near-full bins).

*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a clear, understandable core. Add complexity gradually, validating each addition. Balance exploration (randomness) and exploitation (greediness) adaptively. Explicitly handle edge cases and parameter tuning should be done carefully, to allow adapting heuristic behavior to new problem instances.
