**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic introduces randomness to break ties, while the 20th does not directly address tie-breaking, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions; (2nd best) vs (second worst) 2nd heuristic combines fit score and used bin bonus and normalizes waste, while heuristic 19th focuses on normalized waste and encourages fuller bins. The former could be better as It explicitly encourages re-using partially filled bins; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic explicitly penalizes infeasible bins by assigning a very low priority to them. The 2nd heuristic does the same thing, both ensure that the algorithm avoids considering bins that cannot accommodate the item; (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd heuristic calculates normalized waste and relative fullness without using fixed weights but hardcoded calculation, while the 4th uses weights that may have been optimized. This allows for better weighting between different factors; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that heuristic 19th includes a clipping function to ensure the remaining capacity after placement is no less than zero, while heuristic 20th does not have this clipping function. Overall:

- The best heuristics incorporate randomness to avoid local optima.
- Normalizing waste and rewarding fuller bins often lead to better results.
- The use of an explicit infeasibility mask to avoid considering bins that are not feasible is critical.
- Optimized weights provide the flexibility to find the best combination of factors.
- It is important to clip the remaining capacity after placement to be no less than zero to avoid generating error.
- Penalizing almost-full bins more harshly to avoid creating tiny slivers of space appears beneficial.
- Scaling penalties and bonuses by item size allows for adaptive behavior.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider incorporating randomness, normalizing waste, penalizing infeasible solutions, tuning weights, and preventing overflow/underflow by clipping the results. Adaptive scaling can be beneficial. It's important to balance exploration (randomness) and exploitation (greediness).
