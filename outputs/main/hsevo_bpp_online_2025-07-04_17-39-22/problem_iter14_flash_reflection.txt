**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use capacity ratio as a primary metric and penalize small fragments. The 1st one introduces more randomness and adaptively adjusts exploration/exploitation more aggressively based on the number of feasible bins. It also has a dynamic fragment penalty based on item size. The 2nd one focuses more on bin diversity and applies a smaller penalty to large bins.

*   Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the 2nd one includes `bin_utilization` to encourage usage of already used bins. The 3rd uses an exponential function to calculate fit score and favors bins with medium remaining capacity. Also, the penalty for infeasible bins is much larger.

*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses `fit_score` based on absolute difference of `bins_remain_cap` and `item`, while 4th uses a normalized `waste` in its `priorities` calculation. The 4th scales noise with respect to `remaining_capacities` while 3rd one scales noise based on the number of valid bins.

*   Comparing (4th) vs (5th), the 5th introduces a `tanh` function to the large capacity mask, which gives diminishing returns. Also, the 5th adaptively scales the randomness based on `num_feasible`. It also has a target utilization parameter.

*   Comparing (5th) vs (6th), the 5th and 6th are the same.

*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both heuristics are identical and incorporate waste normalization and a bin utilization bonus. They also use adaptive noise based on the number of potential bins and implement different exploitation emphasis based on the number of potential bins.

*   Overall: The better heuristics tend to combine multiple factors like capacity ratio, fragment avoidance, bin utilization, and adaptive noise in a more nuanced way. They also incorporate adaptive exploration/exploitation strategies based on the number of feasible bins and other parameters like fill level. They also penalize infeasible bins.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and adaptively adjusting parameters based on the problem state. Introducing randomness can help with exploration, but it should be controlled. Also, balancing exploration and exploitation is critical for good performance.
