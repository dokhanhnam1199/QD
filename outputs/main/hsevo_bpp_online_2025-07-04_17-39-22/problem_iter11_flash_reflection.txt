**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines normalized waste and bin utilization with dynamic noise, while the worst focuses on capacity ratio, waste, and dynamic noise but adds a penalty for bins becoming nearly full, a bonus for perfect fills, and normalizes priorities.
(2nd best) vs (2nd worst): the second best balances fit, waste, fullness, and randomness, boosting bins with smaller remaining capacity and using adaptive noise. The second worst, similar to the worst, includes capacity ratio, waste, dynamic noise, near-full bin discouragement, and encourages re-use of nearly full bins.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best uses a simpler noise scaling strategy based on the number of potential bins, while the second best scales noise by the mean remaining capacity of potential bins.
(3rd) vs (4th): these two are identical.
Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst offers more encouragement toward usage of bins already nearly full while the worst also has near full bin discourage. Overall:

*   **Feature Importance:** The best heuristics prioritize normalized waste and bin utilization. Penalizing future waste and rewarding already utilized bins appears effective.
*   **Noise Scaling:** Simpler noise scaling mechanisms tied directly to the number of viable bins perform better. Complex scaling with bin capacities may be less effective.
*   **Over-Engineering:** The worst heuristics attempt too many adjustments (penalties/bonuses) based on fine-grained conditions (e.g., nearly full bins, perfect fills). This can lead to instability.
*   **Balanced Approach:** Adaptive exploration and exploitation is important, but overemphasizing either can be detrimental. Adaptive randomness, controlled by average bin fill levels or number of feasible bins, are used to break the tie.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with a simple, intuitive core (e.g., normalized waste, bin utilization). Add complexity gradually, and carefully test each addition. Avoid over-engineering by focusing on a few key factors and scaling noise with item size and # feasible bins.
