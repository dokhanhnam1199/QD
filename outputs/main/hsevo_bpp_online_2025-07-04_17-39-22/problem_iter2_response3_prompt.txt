Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

It uses explicit loops. Whereas, 4th is similar to the 1st and vectorised, normalizing waste.\n*   Comparing (5th) vs (6th), the 5th uses a weighted sum of `fit_priority`, `remaining_cap_penalty`, and `utilization_priority`. The 6th prioritizes based on normalized waste and relative fullness. The key difference is the weighted combination of multiple explicit heuristics versus a more direct calculation.\n*   Comparing (7th) vs (8th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.\n*   Comparing (9th) vs (10th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.\n*   Comparing (11th) vs (12th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.\n*   Comparing (13th) vs (14th), we observe a significant shift in sophistication. The 13th focuses on a basic ratio of item size to bin size, adding a term for waste. In contrast, the 14th employs a more complex approach, including a fragmentation penalty and a random factor.\n*   Comparing (15th) vs (16th), the 15th re-implements the 14th. The 16th uses \"potential energy\" to choose bins and avoids trivial fills.\n*   Comparing (17th) vs (18th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.\n*   Comparing (19th) vs (20th), there's no actual difference in the code, just the ranking.\n*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (19th) applies scaling factors on different equations that mimic physics to compute priorities, while the (20th) re-implements the (19th).\n* Overall: The better heuristics balance several factors (fit, fullness, waste), and *normalize* values to comparable scales. The use of np.inf to strongly discourage invalid moves (item doesn't fit) is consistently good. The very best heuristics, use `numpy` effectively for vectorized calculations, rather than explicit loops. The worst heuristics either don't handle edge cases, have very complex formulas that don't result in improvements, or apply no penalty for overfill. Simpler, normalized approaches seem to outperform complex, multi-factor equations.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective for designing better heuristics, keeping in mind the goal of avoiding ineffective practices (which are currently undefined, so we'll focus on generally good practices).\n\nHere's a breakdown to guide the redefined self-reflection process:\n\n*   **Keywords:** *Adaptive, Iterative, Modular, Validation, Experimentation.*\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on iterative refinement through experimentation. Design heuristics as modular components, enabling easy modification and combination. Continuously validate performance against benchmarks and adapt based on results.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, rigid designs, relying solely on intuition without empirical validation, ignoring problem-specific characteristics.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static, predefined heuristics. Embrace an adaptive approach where the heuristic's parameters or structure can be adjusted based on feedback from the search process or the problem instance itself. Modular design allows for easier testing and combination of different heuristic components. Rigorous validation is crucial to ensure the heuristic consistently improves performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
