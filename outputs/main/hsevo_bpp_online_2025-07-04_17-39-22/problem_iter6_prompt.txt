Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # A bin must have enough capacity to accommodate the item. Otherwise the priority should be very low.\n    infeasible_mask = bins_remain_cap < item\n    priorities[infeasible_mask] = -np.inf  # Make infeasible bins have the lowest priority.\n\n    # Encourage bins that fit the item *relatively* well (but not too perfectly, to avoid small remaining spaces).\n\n    feasible_mask = ~infeasible_mask\n    remaining_capacity_after_fit = bins_remain_cap[feasible_mask] - item\n    capacity_ratio = item / bins_remain_cap[feasible_mask]  # ratio of item size to bin capacity\n\n    # Priority is high if the capacity ratio is high AND the remaining space is small *relative* to the item\n    # This favors using most of the bin's space without creating *very* small fragments.\n\n    priorities[feasible_mask] = capacity_ratio * np.exp(-remaining_capacity_after_fit / (item + 1e-9))\n\n    # Introduce some randomness to break ties and explore the search space more effectively.\n    priorities += np.random.normal(0, 0.01, size=len(priorities))\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective for heuristic design, keeping in mind the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\" and aiming for actionable insights.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, dynamic balance, constraint awareness, robustification.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on developing heuristics that *dynamically adapt* their behavior based on the current state of the bin packing problem. Consider adaptive weighting schemes and methods to intelligently switch between exploration and exploitation phases.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic, static approaches based solely on easily interpretable factors. Avoid premature optimization for speed at the expense of solution quality and flexibility. Don't rely *only* on penalizing infeasibility with -inf; seek methods to prevent infeasibility.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need adaptability and robustness. Move beyond simple greediness and static parameters. Explicitly address constraint handling *before* infeasibility occurs, and allow the heuristic to adjust its strategies based on the problem's progress.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
