Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, multi-factor, objective-driven, tunable, incremental refinement.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics combining multiple *carefully chosen* factors, weighting them through tunable parameters, allowing adaptation across diverse problem instances. Explicitly define and prioritize objectives.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex systems initially. Premature optimization. Relying on simple ratios. Neglecting objective-driven design.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on creating flexible heuristics driven by clear, measurable objectives, gradually adding complexity and tuning parameters based on iterative evaluation. Prioritize adaptability and avoid premature optimization of overly complex systems.
