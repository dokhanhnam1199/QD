(2nd best) vs (second worst),  the second best includes fill rate, remaining capacity optimization, margin bonuses, closest fit bonuses, and a diversity factor, while the second worst only focuses on wasted space and item/bin ratio. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best places a greater emphasis on precisely managing remaining capacity and penalizing both under and over utilization through target capacity.  (3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) considers a target capacity and fullness incentive, while (4th) focuses on feasibility, waste, and item/bin ratio. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (19th) and (20th) are identical. Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors, including feasibility, waste minimization, target capacity, fullness incentives, and fragmentation penalties. They also often involve tunable parameters and normalization to improve performance. More complex heuristics appear to perform better, but computational cost should be considered. Simpler approaches only focusing on ratios or waste are generally inferior.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, multi-factor, objective-driven, tunable, incremental refinement.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics combining multiple *carefully chosen* factors, weighting them through tunable parameters, allowing adaptation across diverse problem instances. Explicitly define and prioritize objectives.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex systems initially. Premature optimization. Relying on simple ratios. Neglecting objective-driven design.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on creating flexible heuristics driven by clear, measurable objectives, gradually adding complexity and tuning parameters based on iterative evaluation. Prioritize adaptability and avoid premature optimization of overly complex systems.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
