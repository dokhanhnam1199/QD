(2nd best) vs (second worst): The second-best includes target capacity, incentives for almost-full bins, penalties for small bins, and bonuses for nearly-empty bins, where second worst heuristic using log ratios of item size and bin remaining capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first focuses on an ideal remaining capacity, deviation, and fragmentation prevention, while the second targets a capacity, fills almost full bins, prevents small capacity bins, and fills nearly empty bins. (3rd) vs (4th): Both try to minimize waste and manage bin capacity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both use log ratios. Overall: The better heuristics consider a combination of factors, while worse heuristics only using ratios of item size and bin remaining capacity or not considering feasible bins. Sophisticated heuristics incorporates thresholds and bonuses/penalties to guide the packing process.\n- \nOkay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, keeping in mind your desire for a powerful approach and avoiding pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, balanced consideration, adaptive weights, explicit feasibility.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design a *multi-objective* heuristic. Frame the problem as simultaneously optimizing fullness, minimizing fragmentation, and targeting remaining capacity. Balance these conflicting objectives.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex penalties/bonuses. Ratios and simple rules. Treating all factors as equally important initially.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple multi-objective function. Use adaptive weights or Pareto optimization to balance the competing objectives. Address feasibility directly and incrementally add complexity, evaluating each addition's impact on the overall performance and generalizability.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
