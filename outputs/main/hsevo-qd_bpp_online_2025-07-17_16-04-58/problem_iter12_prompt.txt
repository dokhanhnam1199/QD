Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize priorities with a base value (e.g., all zeros)\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Filter bins that can actually accommodate the item\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(feasible_bins):\n        # No bin can fit the item.

Frame the problem as simultaneously optimizing fullness, minimizing fragmentation, and targeting remaining capacity. Balance these conflicting objectives.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex penalties/bonuses. Ratios and simple rules. Treating all factors as equally important initially.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple multi-objective function. Use adaptive weights or Pareto optimization to balance the competing objectives. Address feasibility directly and incrementally add complexity, evaluating each addition's impact on the overall performance and generalizability.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
