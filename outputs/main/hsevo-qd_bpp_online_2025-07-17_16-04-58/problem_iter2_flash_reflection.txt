**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic directly calculates priorities based on remaining capacity, penalizing bins that cannot fit, and favoring bins with smaller remaining space, while the worst attempts a complex combination of perfect fit bonus, can-fit condition, used bin bonus and almost full penalty. The best is more concise and focused. Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), we see the second best introduces ideal remaining range. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) uses inverse of remaining space with an epsilon to avoid division by zero, while (2nd) introduces an "ideal remaining range" and small randomness. (3rd) vs (4th) show that (3rd) adds a gravitational pull effect (higher priority to fuller bins) and slight preference to more empty bins to distribute load, while (4th) prioritize bins based on space utilization around 0.8 and gives priority based on how full the bins are. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (second worst) prioritizes based on waste relative to the mean waste, penalizes waste under 0.1, while (worst) is a complex combination. Overall: Simpler heuristics focusing on remaining capacity and avoiding fragmentation tend to perform better. Penalizing infeasible bins with -inf is very useful. The "sweet spot" for remaining capacity (not too much waste, not too little) is important. Exploration via randomness can help but should be a small factor. Overly complex combinations of bonuses and penalties might be detrimental.

**Experience:**
Prioritize simplicity and focus on core objectives like minimizing wasted space and fragmentation. Use -inf for infeasible solutions. Experiment with different ways to define the "ideal" remaining capacity. Avoid overly complex bonus/penalty systems; start simple and add complexity incrementally, evaluating each addition.
