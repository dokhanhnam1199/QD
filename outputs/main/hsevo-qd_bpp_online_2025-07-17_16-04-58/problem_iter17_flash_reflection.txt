**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic considers an "ideal remaining capacity" and uses the inverse of the deviation from this ideal as a priority, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the item/bin ratio. The best also includes bonus for almost full bins and penalties for large remaining capacity. (2nd) uses wasted_space (bins_remain_cap - item) directly which is simpler.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), which are 2nd and 19th, we see 2nd also uses wasted_space (bins_remain_cap - item) directly. And 19th contains only `return priorities` so we can ignore.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic tries to keep remaining capacity near an ideal value. The second heuristic prioritizes minimizing wasted space and encouraging tighter fits. The first is more complex and aims for a more specific target state in each bin.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic also uses a target capacity and fullness incentives and fragmentation penalties. In contrast, the 4th heuristic is the same as the first, so this comparison reveals nothing new about the qualities of the better heuristic.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), which are 2nd and 1st, we see only difference in item / bin ratio.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate several factors into their priority calculations, including the remaining capacity after placement, a target or ideal remaining capacity, bonuses for almost-full bins, and penalties for fragmented fills or bins that are too empty. They aim for a balance between filling bins completely and avoiding fragmentation. Simpler heuristics like just minimizing waste are not as effective. Introducing tunable parameters and specific objectives improves performance. Using the inverse of a deviation from an ideal or target capacity is helpful.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider multiple objectives like fill rate, fragmentation, and load balancing. Use tunable parameters to fine-tune the heuristic for specific problem instances. Aim for a target remaining capacity to balance fullness and future placement options.
