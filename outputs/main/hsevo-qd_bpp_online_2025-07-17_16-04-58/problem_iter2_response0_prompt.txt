Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The best is more concise and focused. Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), we see the second best introduces ideal remaining range. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) uses inverse of remaining space with an epsilon to avoid division by zero, while (2nd) introduces an \"ideal remaining range\" and small randomness. (3rd) vs (4th) show that (3rd) adds a gravitational pull effect (higher priority to fuller bins) and slight preference to more empty bins to distribute load, while (4th) prioritize bins based on space utilization around 0.8 and gives priority based on how full the bins are. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (second worst) prioritizes based on waste relative to the mean waste, penalizes waste under 0.1, while (worst) is a complex combination. Overall: Simpler heuristics focusing on remaining capacity and avoiding fragmentation tend to perform better. Penalizing infeasible bins with -inf is very useful. The \"sweet spot\" for remaining capacity (not too much waste, not too little) is important. Exploration via randomness can help but should be a small factor. Overly complex combinations of bonuses and penalties might be detrimental.\n- \nOkay, here's a redefinition of \"Current Self-Reflection\" optimized for designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls, and maximizing usefulness, presented in a structured format:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Core Objectives (Space/Fragmentation), Infeasibility, Ideal Capacity, Incremental Complexity, Evaluation.\n\n*   **Advice:** Begin with simple heuristics focused on minimizing waste and fragmentation. Represent infeasibility clearly (e.g., -inf). Define and test different \"ideal remaining capacity\" metrics to guide allocation.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex bonus/penalty systems early on. Introduce complexity only after thoroughly evaluating simpler heuristics.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a clear understanding of the basic heuristic's performance *before* layering on refinements. Measure the impact of each added element. Focus on core goals first.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
