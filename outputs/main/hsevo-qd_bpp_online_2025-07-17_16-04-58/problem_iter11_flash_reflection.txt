**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates several factors like ideal remaining capacity, bonuses for almost full bins, and penalties for large remaining capacities to reduce fragmentation, while the worst only uses the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst): The second-best includes target capacity, incentives for almost-full bins, penalties for small bins, and bonuses for nearly-empty bins, where second worst heuristic using log ratios of item size and bin remaining capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first focuses on an ideal remaining capacity, deviation, and fragmentation prevention, while the second targets a capacity, fills almost full bins, prevents small capacity bins, and fills nearly empty bins. (3rd) vs (4th): Both try to minimize waste and manage bin capacity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both use log ratios. Overall: The better heuristics consider a combination of factors, while worse heuristics only using ratios of item size and bin remaining capacity or not considering feasible bins. Sophisticated heuristics incorporates thresholds and bonuses/penalties to guide the packing process.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics should consider multiple factors, including target remaining capacity, fullness, and fragmentation. Implement bonuses and penalties based on thresholds to steer the search towards better solutions. Avoid simple ratios and always handle infeasibility explicitly.
