Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective and guide the design of better heuristics. Here's a revised approach, keeping in mind the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Tunable Parameters, Iterative Refinement, Penalty/Reward, Normalization, Fragmentation, Target Capacity, Bin Diversity, Feasibility.

*   **Advice:** Start with a simple, feasible heuristic focused on core objectives (e.g., waste minimization). Iteratively introduce complexity by adding factors like target remaining capacity, margin bonuses, and fragmentation penalties, carefully evaluating each addition's impact on overall performance through controlled experiments. Use normalization to allow sensible weighing of different criteria.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, untuned bonus/penalty systems. Premature optimization of all objectives. Complex ratios and hard thresholds without proper evaluation.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design involves a balance between exploration (considering multiple factors) and exploitation (focusing on the most impactful aspects). An iterative, test-driven approach, starting simple and adding complexity incrementally, allows for better understanding of how different factors interact and contribute to overall performance. Tunable parameters and normalization are crucial for adapting the heuristic to different problem instances and scales.
