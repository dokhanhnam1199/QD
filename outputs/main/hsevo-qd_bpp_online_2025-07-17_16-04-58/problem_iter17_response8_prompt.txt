Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The best also includes bonus for almost full bins and penalties for large remaining capacity. (2nd) uses wasted_space (bins_remain_cap - item) directly which is simpler.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), which are 2nd and 19th, we see 2nd also uses wasted_space (bins_remain_cap - item) directly. And 19th contains only `return priorities` so we can ignore.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic tries to keep remaining capacity near an ideal value. The second heuristic prioritizes minimizing wasted space and encouraging tighter fits. The first is more complex and aims for a more specific target state in each bin.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic also uses a target capacity and fullness incentives and fragmentation penalties. In contrast, the 4th heuristic is the same as the first, so this comparison reveals nothing new about the qualities of the better heuristic.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), which are 2nd and 1st, we see only difference in item / bin ratio.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics incorporate several factors into their priority calculations, including the remaining capacity after placement, a target or ideal remaining capacity, bonuses for almost-full bins, and penalties for fragmented fills or bins that are too empty. They aim for a balance between filling bins completely and avoiding fragmentation. Simpler heuristics like just minimizing waste are not as effective. Introducing tunable parameters and specific objectives improves performance. Using the inverse of a deviation from an ideal or target capacity is helpful.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective and guide the design of better heuristics. Here's a revised approach, keeping in mind the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Tunable Parameters, Iterative Refinement, Penalty/Reward, Normalization, Fragmentation, Target Capacity, Bin Diversity, Feasibility.\n\n*   **Advice:** Start with a simple, feasible heuristic focused on core objectives (e.g., waste minimization). Iteratively introduce complexity by adding factors like target remaining capacity, margin bonuses, and fragmentation penalties, carefully evaluating each addition's impact on overall performance through controlled experiments. Use normalization to allow sensible weighing of different criteria.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, untuned bonus/penalty systems. Premature optimization of all objectives. Complex ratios and hard thresholds without proper evaluation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design involves a balance between exploration (considering multiple factors) and exploitation (focusing on the most impactful aspects). An iterative, test-driven approach, starting simple and adding complexity incrementally, allows for better understanding of how different factors interact and contribute to overall performance. Tunable parameters and normalization are crucial for adapting the heuristic to different problem instances and scales.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
