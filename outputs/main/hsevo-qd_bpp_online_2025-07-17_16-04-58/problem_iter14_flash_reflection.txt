**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates a combination of factors like remaining capacity, almost-fullness, and small capacity penalties, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the item/bin ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst),  the second best includes fill rate, remaining capacity optimization, margin bonuses, closest fit bonuses, and a diversity factor, while the second worst only focuses on wasted space and item/bin ratio. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best places a greater emphasis on precisely managing remaining capacity and penalizing both under and over utilization through target capacity.  (3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) considers a target capacity and fullness incentive, while (4th) focuses on feasibility, waste, and item/bin ratio. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (19th) and (20th) are identical. Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors, including feasibility, waste minimization, target capacity, fullness incentives, and fragmentation penalties. They also often involve tunable parameters and normalization to improve performance. More complex heuristics appear to perform better, but computational cost should be considered. Simpler approaches only focusing on ratios or waste are generally inferior.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors and using tunable parameters to adapt to different problem instances.  Normalization and penalties for undesirable states (e.g., fragmentation) can significantly improve performance. Start with simpler approaches then progressively add complexity by considering target capacity, margin bonus, and bin diversity.
