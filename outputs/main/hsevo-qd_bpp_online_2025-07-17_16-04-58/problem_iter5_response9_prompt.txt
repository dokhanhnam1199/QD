The worst heuristic simply calculates `-log(item / bins_remain_cap)`, without considering feasibility or fullness.\n\n*   Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic considers remaining capacity after placement, boosts almost-full bins, and penalizes small-capacity bins. The 19th heuristic, similar to the worst, relies only on `-log(item / bins_remain_cap)`.\n\n*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first prioritizes avoiding infeasibility by setting infeasible bins to `-np.inf` whereas the second sets `remaining_capacity_after_placement` to -1. The first one is clear to understand than the second.\n\n*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third introduces the concept of an \"ideal remaining capacity,\" trying to keep some space for future items, and penalizes large remaining capacities. In contrast, the fourth is more basic, focusing on minimizing waste and encouraging fullness without an explicit ideal.\n\n*   Comparing (9th) vs (17th), the ninth introduces hyperparameter that can be tune for better performance. Meanwhile, the 17th focuses on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity, which can be problematic and have no control.\n\n*   Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), 18th and 20th are the same.\n\n*   The middle heuristics (16th, 15th, 14th, 13th, 12th, 11th, 10th) all share the same core structure of the 9th heuristic, but lack its completion. The code only initializes the `priorities` array and checks for infeasible bins, without implementing any prioritization logic. This explains their poor performance.\n\n*   Overall: Good heuristics balance feasibility, waste minimization, and encouragement of fullness. More advanced heuristics incorporate concepts like ideal remaining capacity and penalties for fragmentation. Making parameters tunable seems to improve performance. Simpler heuristics tend to be less effective.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection.\"\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, waste, compactness, target capacity, fragmentation, tunability, simplicity, incremental.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on core objectives (waste & fragmentation) first. Use clear infeasibility markers (e.g., -inf). Systematically explore target capacity definitions.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex penalty systems initially. Prematurely adding parameters. Ignoring the need for tunable parameters.\n*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple heuristic targeting core objectives. Incrementally add complexity and tunable parameters, validating each addition's impact on performance. Keep in mind the feasibility, waste minimization, encouragement of fullness/compactness, ideally, target a small remaining capacity, penalize highly fragmented allocations.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
