Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a breakdown designed for effective improvement:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, Objective Clarity, Multifaceted Evaluation, Iterative Refinement.
*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze factor interactions and their impact on objective functions (feasibility, waste). Design tunable parameters to achieve adaptability to any datasets.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches, Premature complex bonus/penalty system, and unfocused experimentation.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of solely focusing on simplicity, the focus should be on identifying key factors and systematically exploring their interactions. Start with a clear baseline, iteratively adding complexity while rigorously evaluating each addition using controlled experiments.
