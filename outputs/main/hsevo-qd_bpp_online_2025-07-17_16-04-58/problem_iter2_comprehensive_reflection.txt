Okay, here's a redefinition of "Current Self-Reflection" optimized for designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls, and maximizing usefulness, presented in a structured format:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Core Objectives (Space/Fragmentation), Infeasibility, Ideal Capacity, Incremental Complexity, Evaluation.

*   **Advice:** Begin with simple heuristics focused on minimizing waste and fragmentation. Represent infeasibility clearly (e.g., -inf). Define and test different "ideal remaining capacity" metrics to guide allocation.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex bonus/penalty systems early on. Introduce complexity only after thoroughly evaluating simpler heuristics.

*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a clear understanding of the basic heuristic's performance *before* layering on refinements. Measure the impact of each added element. Focus on core goals first.
