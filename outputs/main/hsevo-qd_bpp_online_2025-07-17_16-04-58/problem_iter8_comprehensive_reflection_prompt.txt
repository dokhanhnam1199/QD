{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and their interactions. Incorporate tunable parameters to adapt the algorithm for any data. Prioritize clear objectives like feasibility and waste minimization. Experiment with different combinations and weightings of factors to optimize performance.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and focus on core objectives like minimizing wasted space and fragmentation. Use -inf for infeasible solutions. Experiment with different ways to define the \"ideal\" remaining capacity. Avoid overly complex bonus/penalty systems; start simple and add complexity incrementally, evaluating each addition.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider: (1) feasibility constraints, (2) waste minimization, (3) encouragement of fullness/compactness, (4) ideally, target a small remaining capacity, (5) penalize highly fragmented allocations, (6) make important parameters tunable via hyperparameter optimization.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
