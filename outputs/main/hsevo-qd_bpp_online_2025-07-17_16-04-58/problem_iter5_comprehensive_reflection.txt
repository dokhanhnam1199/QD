Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, waste, compactness, target capacity, fragmentation, tunability, simplicity, incremental.
*   **Advice:** Focus on core objectives (waste & fragmentation) first. Use clear infeasibility markers (e.g., -inf). Systematically explore target capacity definitions.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex penalty systems initially. Prematurely adding parameters. Ignoring the need for tunable parameters.
*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple heuristic targeting core objectives. Incrementally add complexity and tunable parameters, validating each addition's impact on performance. Keep in mind the feasibility, waste minimization, encouragement of fullness/compactness, ideally, target a small remaining capacity, penalize highly fragmented allocations.
