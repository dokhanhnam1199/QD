Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, keeping in mind your desire for a powerful approach and avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, balanced consideration, adaptive weights, explicit feasibility.

*   **Advice:** Design a *multi-objective* heuristic. Frame the problem as simultaneously optimizing fullness, minimizing fragmentation, and targeting remaining capacity. Balance these conflicting objectives.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex penalties/bonuses. Ratios and simple rules. Treating all factors as equally important initially.

*   **Explanation:** Start with a simple multi-objective function. Use adaptive weights or Pareto optimization to balance the competing objectives. Address feasibility directly and incrementally add complexity, evaluating each addition's impact on the overall performance and generalizability.
