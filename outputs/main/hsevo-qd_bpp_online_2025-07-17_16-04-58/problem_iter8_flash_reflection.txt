**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates infeasibility checks, wasted space minimization, target capacity considerations, and encourages filling, while the worst only calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) is a direct copy of (best). (3rd best) is a direct copy of (best). Comparing (1st) vs (4th), we see that the first prioritizes minimizing wasted space and targeting a specific remaining capacity, while the fourth focuses on an ideal remaining capacity and penalizing large capacities to avoid fragmentation. (5th best) focuses mainly on minimizing wasted space and encouraging filling. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Comparing (11th best) and (17th best), the only difference is the default value for tunable parameters.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors, including feasibility, waste minimization, target capacity, and fullness, using carefully tuned weights or thresholds. The inferior heuristics focus on fewer factors or simpler calculations, such as a ratio or log ratio. Introducing tunable parameters into the heuristic to make it possible to adapt the algorithm for any data.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and their interactions. Incorporate tunable parameters to adapt the algorithm for any data. Prioritize clear objectives like feasibility and waste minimization. Experiment with different combinations and weightings of factors to optimize performance.
