Focus on simple, effective penalties for space and overflows; consider bin capacity directly.
Focus on fit feasibility, penalize non-fit bins, prioritize reducing fragmentation early.
Consider bin packing strategies like First-Fit Decreasing and prioritize empty bins over nearly full ones.
Focus on perfect/near fits, penalize small capacities, minimize complexity, and avoid division pitfalls.
Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize small bins, dynamically adjust weights.
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize non-fit bins harshly, and encourage using larger residual spaces progressively.
Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize small bins, dynamically adjust weights.
Consider simplifying priority logic, focusing on fit feasibility first, minimal fragmentation next.
Focus on item-bin fit, penalize overfull bins, avoid large capacity mismatches.
Prioritize minimal unused space; penalize overflows harshly to reduce fragmentation.
