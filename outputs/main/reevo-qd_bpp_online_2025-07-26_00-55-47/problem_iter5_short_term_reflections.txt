Focus on minimizing unused space and penalizing overflows more heavily, reducing fragmentation and improving efficiency.
Dynamic weights, near-perfect fits, penalize small gaps, fill larger bins first.
Consider perfect fits, near-perfect fits, and size penalties. Use weighted sums for final priority scoring.
Combine fit proximity, penalize near-full bins, favor larger available spaces dynamically.
Combine fit proximity, penalize near-full bins, favor larger available spaces dynamically.
Simplify heuristics by focusing on fit feasibility, penalize gaps, and avoid unnecessary penalties or weights.
Use penalties for overflow and non-minimal remaining space, enhancing a First-Fit Decreasing strategy for better item placement efficiency.
Penalize overflows heavily, prioritize bins with lower post-insertion remaining capacity.
Focus on perfect and near-perfect fits, penalize fragmentation and near-overfull bins, dynamically weigh capacities, and discourage small gaps.
Prioritize perfect fits, near fits, penalize large gaps; dynamically weight based on bin capacity, avoid almost fulls.
