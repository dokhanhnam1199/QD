def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation prioritizes bins where the item fits perfectly or almost perfectly,
    penalizes bins that are almost full but cannot fit the item, and dynamically adjusts weights
    based on the remaining capacity of the bins. It also penalizes fragmentation by minimizing gaps
    and encourages filling larger bins first. This version refines weights and thresholds.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
