Consider nearest neighbors, node proximity, sparsification, normalization, and avoid zero values.

Combine inverse distance, nearest neighbor rank (with sharper decay), sparsification, and normalization for effective TSP heuristics.

Prioritize local information, sharpen nearest neighbor decay, and simplify global context.

Avoid division by zero; handle zero heuristic values for better exploration.

Incorporate nearest neighbors, consider average distances, adaptively sparsify, and normalize to improve heuristic quality.

Incorporate nearest neighbor information, average distance, and sparsification for improved TSP heuristics.

Sharper nearest neighbor decay (1/rankÂ²) and handling zero heuristic values improve exploration.

Sparsification, sharper nearest neighbor decay, and adaptive `k` improve TSP heuristic performance.

Consider global context, exponential neighbor ranking, adaptive sparsification, and normalization with default exploration.

Sharper nearest neighbor prioritization, robust edge case handling, and normalization are key improvements.
