Sharper nearest neighbor decay, handling zero division, and robust normalization improve heuristic quality.

Consider node proximity, neighbor rank, global distance context, and sparsification for effective exploration.

Consider node proximity, and balance exploration/exploitation by tuning decay and sparsification.

Factor combination, nearest neighbors, sparsification, and normalization improve exploration and solution quality.

Sharper nearest neighbor ranking and handling zero heuristic values improve solution quality.

Incorporate nearest neighbors, average distances, and adaptive sparsification with normalization for better TSP heuristics.

Softer nearest neighbor ranking and avoiding division by zero improve heuristic quality.

Softer decay on nearest neighbor rank (using `exp` instead of `1/rank^2`) improved performance.

Sharper nearest neighbor ranking decay and handling zero heuristic values improve exploration and solution quality.

Consider global context (factor 3), simpler neighbor ranking, and impact of normalization.
