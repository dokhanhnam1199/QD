Incorporate neighbor rank, node proximity, sparsification, and normalization for improved edge prioritization.

Simpler, normalized heuristics focusing on inverse rank and distance perform better. Node centrality wasn't beneficial.

The better heuristic combines distance, nearest neighbors, centrality, and sparsification with normalization for balanced exploration.

Consider nearest neighbors, node proximity, sparsification, and normalization for effective TSP heuristics.

The improved heuristic combines distance, nearest neighbors, centrality, and sparsification, then normalizes for better exploration.

Sharper nearest neighbor decay, handling zero heuristic values, and preventing division by zero improve performance.

The improved heuristic incorporates nearest neighbors, node centrality, normalization, and sparsification for better TSP edge prioritization.

Sharper nearest neighbor decay, removing centrality, and simplifying combination improved performance.

Sharper nearest neighbor ranking, robust normalization, and handling division-by-zero improve heuristic quality.

Consider nearest neighbors, node proximity, sparsification, and normalization for informed edge selection.
