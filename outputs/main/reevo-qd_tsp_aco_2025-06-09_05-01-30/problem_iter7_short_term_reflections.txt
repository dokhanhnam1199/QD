Simpler combinations, `1/rank` for nearest neighbors, and avoiding centrality improved performance.

Simplify, focus on distance and nearest neighbors, and avoid over-engineering with centrality or average distances.

Consider average distance, and tune the nearest neighbor rank decay.

Sharper nearest neighbor decay, robust average distance handling, and careful normalization improve heuristic quality.

Prioritize nearest neighbors with sharper decay, sparsify, and normalize to improve sampling.

Simpler factor combinations, direct inverse rank, and removing centrality improve heuristic quality.

Consider global context (average distance) and simpler rank scaling for better heuristic guidance.

Sharper nearest neighbor ranking, removal of less effective factors, and robust normalization improve heuristic quality.

Sharper nearest neighbor decay, robust average distance handling, and sparsity improve TSP heuristic quality.

Sharper nearest neighbor decay, and removing centrality improved performance. Explore adaptive sparsification and normalization techniques.
