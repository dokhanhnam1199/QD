Prioritize exact fits; rank others by inverse slack normalized to capacity. Use deterministic best‑fit with ε≈1e‑9 jitter tie‑break. Score = sigmoid(‑slack/ capacity) with steepness from median slack. Apply decaying ε‑greedy or bandit weighting; assign –∞ to infeasibles; use tolerance for float comparisons.
