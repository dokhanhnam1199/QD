Compute feasibility mask; give exact‑fit items a huge bonus; score feasible bins by logistic((median‑slack−slack)/α) normalized by capacity; penalize infeasibles –∞; use tolerance for float compares; break ties with deterministic ε‑jitter; decay ε‑greedy exploration; adapt α/median online; use exponential slack decay for tightness; vectorize for speed.
