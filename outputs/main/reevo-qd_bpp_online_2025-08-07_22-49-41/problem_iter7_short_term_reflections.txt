Adaptive steepness from median slack. Contextual bandit exploration. Normalize slack by bin capacity. Decaying epsilon greedy.
Use decaying epsilon, add jitter, reward near‑exact fits, blend exploitation/exploration, avoid huge constants.
Prioritize exact fits, use best‑fit score, apply decaying epsilon, keep random jitter minimal, prefer deterministic fallback.
Prefer monotonic best‑fit priority; deterministic epsilon tie‑break; large negative penalty for infeasibles; avoid noisy random exploration.
Use deterministic best‑fit (negative residual), large infeasibility penalty, tiny epsilon tie‑breaker, avoid random exploration.
Prioritize exact fits, rank non‑exact by inverse slack, scale jitter with feasible bin count, use ε tolerance.
Smooth scoring, normalize slack, logistic transform, random exploration, tune α/mid_point.
Normalize slack, exponential decay scoring, epsilon‑greedy exploration, avoid infinities, robust capacity estimate, minimal jitter, scale steepness with item size.
Prefer smooth adaptive sigmoid of relative slack; adjust steepness via median slack; avoid random jitter.
Use deterministic proximity scoring (1/(1+slack)), avoid random jitter, penalize infeasible bins uniformly with –inf.
