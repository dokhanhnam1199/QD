- Exact fits first; then highest inverse slack.  
- Deterministic best‑fit; tie‑break with ε≈1e‑9 jitter.  
- Score = sigmoid(‑slack / capacity) with adaptive steepness.  
- Infeasible bins → –∞; prune them.  
- Normalize scores by bin capacity.  
- Decay ε‑greedy; keep ε tiny for stability.  
- Use tolerance for floating‑point comparisons.  
- Use limited lookahead or bandit weighting.
