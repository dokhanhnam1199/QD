Decay epsilon over time, rank by smallest residual, add tiny jitter, avoid extreme bonuses, and ensure infeasible bins stay lowest.
Normalize slack, exponential decay, tiny epsilon‑greedy jitter, deterministic tie‑break, adapt steepness by item size.
Normalize slack, logistic scoring, exact‑fit bonus, jitter, decaying epsilon‑greedy exploration for balanced online BPP.
Prefer simple slack‑based scores, deterministic tie‑breaking jitter, linear weighting; discard sigmoids and random exploration.
Normalize slack, apply steep sigmoid, prioritize exact fits, keep deterministic scores, eliminate random exploration, handle ties consistently.
Use deterministic inverse‑slack scoring, prioritize exact fits, avoid random jitter, ensure monotonicity and simplicity.
Normalize inverse slack, decay epsilon, blend exploration/exploitation, treat exact fits specially, use vectorized ops, avoid infinities.
Use decaying epsilon, normalized inverse slack, small smoothing, avoid extreme bonuses, blend exploration with exploitation.
Prioritize exact fits, smooth logistic scoring, adaptive steepness, deterministic jitter, and optional ε‑greedy exploration.
Use adaptive epsilon decay, normalize inverse slack, add smoothing, randomize, and balance exploitation/exploration for robust priority.
