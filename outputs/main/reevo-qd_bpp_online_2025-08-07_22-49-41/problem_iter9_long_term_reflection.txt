Give exact‑fit items a huge boost; otherwise rank bins by normalized inverse slack (or logistic score with median‑slack steepness). Use deterministic tie‑break with tiny ε jitter. Apply decaying ε‑greedy (or bandit) for limited exploration. Penalize infeasible bins (–∞) and use tolerance for float compares.
