Give exact‑fit items a huge bonus. Score each feasible bin by normalized slack (logistic around median slack). Penalize infeasibles with –∞, using tolerance for float compares. Break ties deterministically with tiny ε jitter. Apply decaying ε‑greedy (or bandit) exploration. Adapt α to item size distribution.
