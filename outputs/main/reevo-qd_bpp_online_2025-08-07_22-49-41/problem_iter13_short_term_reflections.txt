Blend feasibility mask, exact‑fit bonus, logistic slack scaling, adaptive median shift, jitter tie‑break, and decaying ε‑exploration.
Use logistic scoring, exact‑fit bonuses, deterministic jitter, adaptive ε; prioritize tight fits, normalize slack.
Adaptive logistic scoring with median midpoint, exact‑fit bonus, decaying ε‑greedy, deterministic jitter for ties.
Reward exact fits, normalize slack, use adaptive logistic, add deterministic jitter, decay ε‑greedy exploration, vectorize for speed, limit constants.
Use exponential slack decay, adaptive steepness per item, epsilon‑greedy, jitter, and exact‑fit bonus for robust, balanced heuristics.
Adapt logistic midpoint via median, decay epsilon, normalize slack by max capacity, add deterministic jitter, prioritize exact fits.
Use feasibility mask, exact‑fit bonus, logistic scaling, capacity estimate, jitter, and ε‑greedy exploration.
Use adaptive logistic scoring, median-based midpoint, decaying epsilon, exact‑fit bonus, deterministic jitter, robust capacity estimate.
Normalize slack by bin capacity, tune logistic alpha, add epsilon‑greedy exploration, give exact‑fit bonus, and jitter for ties.
Normalize slack, use monotonic transform, avoid randomness, prioritize exact fits, tune sigmoid steepness, ensure deterministic tie‑breaking.
