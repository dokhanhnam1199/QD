**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st and 2nd:
*   **Heuristic 1st** employs a multi-objective scoring system (tightness, waste avoidance, future capacity) and a guided exploration strategy (top 30% scores, moderate capacity bins).
*   **Heuristic 2nd** focuses on tight fit with a perfect fit bonus and a surplus penalty, using a simpler adaptive exploration (top 20% tightest, moderate capacity). It uses a smaller random noise for exploration.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 1st is more complex, with more defined objectives and a more structured exploration. Heuristic 2nd is simpler and more focused on the "tight fit" aspect, with less nuanced exploration.

Comparing Heuristics 2nd and 3rd:
*   These two heuristics are identical.

Comparing Heuristics 3rd and 4th:
*   **Heuristic 3rd** uses a combination of tight fit, perfect fit bonus, and surplus penalty, with adaptive exploration based on top tightest fits and moderate capacity.
*   **Heuristic 4th** is a simpler epsilon-greedy approach combining tight fit (with a perfect fit bonus) and purely random exploration scores. The exploration is applied to *all* valid bins with probability epsilon.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 3rd's exploration is "guided" to specific candidates, aiming for a more informed exploration. Heuristic 4th's exploration is purely random across all eligible bins. Heuristic 3rd also has a more refined scoring for exploitation.

Comparing Heuristics 4th and 5th:
*   These two heuristics are identical.

Comparing Heuristics 5th and 6th:
*   **Heuristic 5th** is a simple epsilon-greedy combining tight fit and random exploration.
*   **Heuristic 6th** employs a more complex multi-objective scoring (tightness, space utilization, future suitability) and a guided exploration strategy (top 15% combined score, median remaining capacity, smallest remaining capacity). It uses Gaussian noise for exploration.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 6th is significantly more sophisticated in its objective definition and exploration strategy compared to the basic epsilon-greedy of Heuristic 5th. It aims to balance multiple packing goals.

Comparing Heuristics 6th and 7th:
*   **Heuristic 6th** is multi-objective with guided exploration.
*   **Heuristic 7th** is a single-objective "tightest fit" with a perfect fit bonus. It lacks any exploration strategy.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 6th is much more advanced due to its multi-objective nature and exploration. Heuristic 7th is a pure exploitation strategy.

Comparing Heuristics 7th and 8th:
*   **Heuristic 7th** focuses solely on minimizing remaining capacity and a bonus for perfect fits.
*   **Heuristic 8th** combines Best Fit with a penalty for large remaining capacity and a bonus for near-perfect fits. It uses a complex, non-linear scoring function.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 8th is more nuanced in its scoring by incorporating penalties and bonuses for specific conditions, whereas Heuristic 7th is simpler and focuses only on the immediate tightest fit.

Comparing Heuristics 8th and 9th:
*   **Heuristic 8th** uses a custom complex score involving scaling and exponentials.
*   **Heuristic 9th** uses an inverse score with a bonus for perfect fits, and then applies a softmax to normalize scores.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 9th's use of softmax can help normalize priorities into a probabilistic-like distribution, which might be useful in some contexts, but the score calculation in Heuristic 8th appears more targeted at specific packing behaviors (penalty for large waste, bonus for near-perfect). Heuristic 8th seems to have a more deliberate design for multiple packing goals.

Comparing Heuristics 9th and 10th:
*   **Heuristic 9th** uses inverse scores with softmax.
*   **Heuristic 10th** implements "Almost Full Fit" by maximizing `item - bins_remain_cap`, which directly prioritizes bins that become exactly full, then those with minimal positive remainder.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 10th has a clearer, more direct implementation of "Almost Full Fit" by maximizing `item - remaining_capacity`. Heuristic 9th's inverse score is related but less direct, and softmax adds normalization. Heuristic 10th is simpler and more purpose-built for its named strategy.

Comparing Heuristics 10th and 11th:
*   **Heuristic 10th** implements "Almost Full Fit" by maximizing `item - bins_remain_cap`.
*   **Heuristic 11th** implements "Almost Full Fit" by maximizing `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)`.
*   **Difference:** Both aim for tight fits. Heuristic 11th's inverse score will strongly favor bins that are very close to full, potentially more so than Heuristic 10th's linear approach. Heuristic 10th's direct maximization of `item - remaining_capacity` is simpler to understand and implement for the "exactly full" goal.

Comparing Heuristics 11th and 12th:
*   These are functionally identical (both use `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)` for fitting bins). The only difference is the presence of unused imports in 12th.

Comparing Heuristics 12th and 13th:
*   These are identical.

Comparing Heuristics 13th and 14th:
*   These are identical.

Comparing Heuristics 14th and 15th:
*   **Heuristic 14th** uses `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)`, with a special case for exact fits (score 1.0).
*   **Heuristic 15th** uses a more complex scoring: perfect fits get 1000.0, non-perfect fits get `-(remaining_capacity) + (original_capacity / MaxCapacity) * tie_breaker_factor`. It prioritizes perfect fits, then tight fits, and breaks ties using original capacity.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 15th is significantly more sophisticated due to its prioritized scoring and tie-breaking mechanism, aiming for a more robust tight-fit strategy. Heuristic 14th is simpler.

Comparing Heuristics 15th and 16th:
*   **Heuristic 15th** is a sophisticated tight-fit strategy with tie-breaking.
*   **Heuristic 16th** implements a pure "Random Fit" strategy, assigning random priorities to any bin that can fit the item.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 15th is an exploitation-focused strategy, while Heuristic 16th is a pure exploration strategy. Heuristic 15th is far more intelligent in its bin selection.

Comparing Heuristics 16th and 17th:
*   **Heuristic 16th** is pure random fit.
*   **Heuristic 17th** is identical to Heuristic 15th.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 17th (and 15th) is a sophisticated exploitation strategy, while Heuristic 16th is a random exploration.

Comparing Heuristics 17th and 18th:
*   **Heuristic 17th** (and 15th) is a strong tight-fit strategy with perfect fit bonus and tie-breaking based on original capacity.
*   **Heuristic 18th** combines Best Fit (inverse scaled remaining capacity), penalty for large waste, and bonus for near-perfect fits using a custom, more complex scoring function.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 18th attempts to balance multiple aspects (tightness, waste, near-perfect fits) with a more elaborate scoring mechanism. Heuristic 17th is primarily focused on tightest fit and perfect fits, with a simpler tie-breaker. Heuristic 18th's approach might be more robust across various item/bin size distributions.

Comparing Heuristics 18th and 19th:
*   These two heuristics are identical.

Comparing Heuristics 19th and 20th:
*   **Heuristic 19th** (and 18th) combines Best Fit, waste penalty, and near-perfect bonus with complex scoring.
*   **Heuristic 20th** implements a pure "Worst Fit" strategy, prioritizing bins with the most remaining capacity.
*   **Difference:** Heuristic 19th is an advanced exploitation strategy focused on tight packing and efficiency, while Heuristic 20th is a simple exploration strategy with a specific (and often sub-optimal for immediate packing) goal.

Overall Ranking Logic:
The top heuristics (1st, 6th) introduce multi-objective optimization and sophisticated guided exploration. The next tier (3rd, 15th/17th, 18th/19th) focus on advanced exploitation, balancing tight fits, perfect fits, and sometimes waste penalties. Mid-tier heuristics (2nd, 4th, 10th, 14th) use simpler exploitation strategies like basic tight fit or epsilon-greedy. Lower tiers are pure random (16th) or specific but often suboptimal strategies (20th Worst Fit, 11th/12th/13th basic inverse).

**Experience:**
Heuristics that combine multiple objectives (tightness, waste, future suitability) and employ guided exploration (sampling from good candidates, not just random) tend to perform better. Simple epsilon-greedy can be a good baseline, but refined scoring and targeted exploration are key for higher performance. Avoid pure random or overly simplistic strategies for complex packing problems.
