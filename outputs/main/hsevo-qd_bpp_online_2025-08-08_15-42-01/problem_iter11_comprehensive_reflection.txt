Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better optimization heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, multi-objective, guided exploration, performance feedback.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that learn from past placements and dynamically adjust their strategy. Integrate feedback mechanisms to refine scoring and exploration parameters based on actual packing outcomes.
*   **Avoid:** Static rules, brute-force random sampling, or heuristics that don't adapt to problem instance characteristics.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves understanding *why* a heuristic performs well or poorly on specific instances, leading to more intelligent adaptation rather than just applying predefined complex rules.
