Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Bin Packing, Tight Packing, Perfect Fits, Exploration, Scoring, Adaptability.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *maximizing utilization* and *exploring beneficial deviations* from greedy approaches. Quantify the value of "perfect fits" and incorporate adaptive scoring.
*   **Avoid:** Relying solely on simple "fill first" logic; ignoring the long-term impact of placement choices; implementing exploration without a clear performance target.
*   **Explanation:** Current success hinges on packing densely. Effective heuristics should explicitly reward this (e.g., bonus for tight fits) and consider intelligent exploration to find even better packings than pure greedy, rather than random exploration which often degrades performance.
