**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Best) vs Heuristic 2 (Second Best): They are identical.
Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 3: They are identical.
Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 4: Heuristic 1 introduces a hybrid approach with exploration (epsilon probability) and guided candidate selection, whereas Heuristic 4 is purely deterministic best-fit with a penalty for large remainders. Heuristic 1's approach is more sophisticated in balancing immediate needs with future possibilities.
Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 5: Heuristic 1 uses a probability-based exploration with candidate selection, while Heuristic 5 attempts to integrate exploration by preferring bins with more remaining capacity, but without a clear probabilistic mechanism. Heuristic 1's explicit exploration is likely more effective.
Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 6: Heuristic 1 is a hybrid of tightest fit with exploration. Heuristic 6 is multi-objective, incorporating utilization and adaptive exploration (though the adaptive part is simulated). Heuristic 6 attempts a more holistic approach by considering bin utilization.
Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 7: Heuristic 1 is a simpler hybrid. Heuristic 7 builds on multi-objective scoring, adaptive exploration probability, and identifies candidates based on both tightness and moderate capacity, making it more nuanced than Heuristic 1.
Comparing Heuristic 7 vs Heuristic 8: Heuristic 8 builds on Heuristic 7's multi-objective scoring but refines it with better tie-breaking and exploration based on candidate selection and perturbations. Heuristic 8 seems to have a more structured approach to balancing objectives.
Comparing Heuristic 8 vs Heuristic 9: Heuristic 8 is a complex multi-objective heuristic with exploration. Heuristic 9 is a very simple heuristic that prioritizes bins with small remaining capacity (inverse of remaining capacity) and gives a bonus to perfect fits. Heuristic 8 is significantly more advanced.
Comparing Heuristic 9 vs Heuristic 10: Heuristics 9 and 10 are almost identical, with Heuristic 9 having a slight preference for perfect fits (score of 1.0 vs inverse of remainder) and Heuristic 10 purely using inverse of remainder. Both are simple "best-fit" variations.
Comparing Heuristic 10 vs Heuristic 11: Heuristic 10 is a simple inverse remainder score. Heuristic 11 is also best-fit focused but adds a tie-breaker favoring larger original capacity and a specific score for perfect fits. Heuristic 11 is more refined for tie-breaking.
Comparing Heuristic 11 vs Heuristic 12: Heuristic 11 is a best-fit with tie-breaking. Heuristic 12 introduces several tunable parameters for exploration probability, bonuses, penalties, and candidate selection, indicating a more experimental and potentially optimized approach to balancing objectives.
Comparing Heuristic 12 vs Heuristic 13: Heuristic 12 is a complex multi-objective heuristic. Heuristic 13 is a "Random Fit" strategy, assigning random priorities to bins that can fit the item. This is a very basic approach compared to Heuristic 12.
Comparing Heuristic 13 vs Heuristic 14: Heuristics 13 and 14 are identical "Random Fit" strategies.
Comparing Heuristic 14 vs Heuristic 15: Heuristic 14 is random. Heuristic 15 is a complex multi-objective heuristic with adaptive exploration based on item size variance and capacity utilization gradient, significantly more sophisticated than random.
Comparing Heuristic 15 vs Heuristic 16: Heuristics 15 and 16 are identical.
Comparing Heuristic 16 vs Heuristic 17: Heuristic 16/15 is multi-objective with adaptive exploration based on variance and utilization gradient. Heuristic 17 is also multi-objective, focusing on tightness, future usability (relative to item size), and adaptive exploration for candidates. Heuristic 16/15 seems to have a more defined adaptive exploration mechanism.
Comparing Heuristic 17 vs Heuristic 18: Heuristics 17 and 18 are identical.
Comparing Heuristic 18 vs Heuristic 19: Heuristic 18 is multi-objective with adaptive exploration. Heuristic 19 combines tightness, waste avoidance, future utility, and guided exploration with perturbated scores for candidates. Heuristic 19's exploration is more about perturbing scores of selected candidates.
Comparing Heuristic 19 vs Heuristic 20: Heuristics 19 and 20 are identical.
Overall: The top heuristics (1-8, 15-18) are complex multi-objective strategies that balance tightest fit with some form of future utility or guided exploration. Heuristics 9-11 and 13-14 are simpler best-fit or random strategies. The intermediate heuristics (12, 19-20) attempt variations on multi-objective and exploration. Heuristics 1, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18 appear to represent the most developed ideas, blending multiple objectives and adaptive/guided exploration.

**Experience:**
Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple objectives (tightness, future utility, waste avoidance) with sophisticated exploration strategies (probabilistic, candidate-based, adaptive). Simple best-fit or random strategies are generally inferior. The effectiveness of complex heuristics often depends on parameter tuning and the specific problem instance.
