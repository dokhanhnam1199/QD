**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Best) vs. Heuristic 2 (Worst in this comparison): Both heuristics implement a multi-objective scoring system with exploration. Heuristic 1 is marginally better as it defines exploration candidates based on a combination of top scores and percentile-based moderate capacity, making its exploration more guided. Heuristic 2's exploration candidate selection is identical.

Comparing Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 3: Heuristic 1 uses a more sophisticated multi-objective approach (tightness, waste, future capacity) compared to Heuristic 3's simple tight fit with a perfect fit bonus and basic epsilon-greedy exploration. Heuristic 1's guided exploration is also more nuanced than Heuristic 3's random assignment.

Comparing Heuristic 3 vs. Heuristic 5: Heuristic 3 combines tight fitting with random exploration (epsilon-greedy), while Heuristic 5 focuses purely on tight fitting with a perfect fit bonus. Heuristic 3's exploration component, though basic, offers more potential for finding diverse solutions than Heuristic 5's deterministic approach.

Comparing Heuristic 5 vs. Heuristic 7: These heuristics are identical, both focusing on tight fitting with a perfect fit bonus.

Comparing Heuristic 8 vs. Heuristic 12: Heuristic 8 employs a more refined strategy, balancing tight fitting, perfect fit bonuses, and penalties for large remainders. Heuristic 12 uses a simple inverse capacity for scoring and a binary perfect fit bonus. Heuristic 8's more nuanced scoring and penalty system likely leads to better packing.

Comparing Heuristic 12 vs. Heuristic 15: Both use a simple approach where capacity dictates priority. Heuristic 12 assigns a value of 1.0 for perfect fits and `1.0 / remaining_capacity` otherwise, while Heuristic 15 assigns a random value to fitting bins. Heuristic 12's deterministic scoring for good fits is generally more desirable than random assignment.

Comparing Heuristic 14 vs. Heuristic 17: Heuristic 14 implements a multi-objective scoring system (tightest fit, future utility, awkward empty penalty) with a guided exploration strategy. Heuristic 17 uses similar concepts but with different weighting and thresholds, and its parameters are tuned. Without knowing the exact performance impact of the specific parameter values in Heuristic 17, it's difficult to definitively rank them, but Heuristic 14's systematic approach to multi-objective scoring and guided exploration makes it a strong contender.

Overall: Heuristics that combine a primary objective (like tight fitting) with secondary objectives (like waste avoidance, future utility) and employ guided exploration strategies (rather than pure random exploration) tend to perform better. The inclusion of specific bonuses for perfect fits and penalties for undesirable states (e.g., large surpluses) also improves heuristic design. Simple random or worst-fit strategies are generally the least effective.

**Experience:**
Prioritize tight fitting with bonuses for perfect fits. Incorporate secondary objectives like waste minimization or future utility. Guided exploration, considering bins with good scores or moderate capacities, enhances diversity without sacrificing too much performance. Avoid purely random assignments for good fits.
