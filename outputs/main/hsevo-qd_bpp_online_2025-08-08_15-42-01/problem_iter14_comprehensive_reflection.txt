Here's a redefinition of "Current self-reflection" to guide heuristic design, avoiding ineffective approaches:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, adaptive exploration, sophisticated scoring, penalized residuals, rewarded fits.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically balance multiple objectives (e.g., tightness, future utility, waste) using adaptive exploration strategies that sample promising candidates rather than relying on pure randomness.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic strategies like pure Best Fit or random assignments. Also avoid neglecting the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
*   **Explanation:** Complex, multi-objective heuristics with nuanced scoring (e.g., softmax, explicit penalties/bonuses) and guided exploration are essential for outperforming simpler methods, especially in complex packing problems.
