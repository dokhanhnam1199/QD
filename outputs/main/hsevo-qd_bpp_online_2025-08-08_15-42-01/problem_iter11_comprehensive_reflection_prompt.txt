{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize tight fitting with bonuses for perfect fits. Incorporate secondary objectives like waste minimization or future utility. Guided exploration, considering bins with good scores or moderate capacities, enhances diversity without sacrificing too much performance. Avoid purely random assignments for good fits.\nHeuristics that prioritize filling bins tightly (minimizing post-placement remaining capacity) tend to perform better. Explicitly handling perfect fits with a bonus and using techniques like softmax for scoring can improve performance. Introducing exploration (like epsilon-greedy) can be beneficial for adaptive strategies but adds complexity. Random and worst-fit strategies are generally less effective.\n\nPrioritize complex, multi-objective heuristics that balance exploitation (tight fitting, perfect fits) with nuanced exploration (guided exploration, probabilistic choices). Explicitly penalize undesirable outcomes (large residuals) and reward specific desirable states (perfect fits). Simpler heuristics like pure Best Fit or basic epsilon-greedy perform less effectively. Random strategies are generally poor.\n\nHeuristics that combine multiple objectives (tightness, waste, future suitability) and employ guided exploration (sampling from good candidates, not just random) tend to perform better. Simple epsilon-greedy can be a good baseline, but refined scoring and targeted exploration are key for higher performance. Avoid pure random or overly simplistic strategies for complex packing problems.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
