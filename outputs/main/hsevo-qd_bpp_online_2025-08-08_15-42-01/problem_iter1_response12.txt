```python
def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Worst Fit strategy.

    The Worst Fit strategy aims to place the current item into the bin that has the most remaining capacity.
    This heuristic attempts to keep bins with less capacity available for smaller items later on,
    potentially leading to a more efficient packing in the long run.
    In this priority function, we assign a higher priority score to bins with larger remaining capacities.
    Specifically, the priority is directly proportional to the remaining capacity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.array([bin_cap if bin_cap >= item else -np.inf for bin_cap in bins_remain_cap])
    return priorities
