**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1st (Almost Full Fit) vs. Heuristic 16th (Random Fit), the former focuses on a specific fitting strategy (minimizing remaining capacity after placement), while the latter uses random assignment for valid bins. Heuristic 1st is likely better as it's deterministic and aims for efficiency.

Comparing Heuristic 2nd (Softmax-Based Fit) vs. Heuristic 11th (Inverse of Remaining Capacity with special case for perfect fit), both aim to prioritize bins with less remaining capacity. Heuristic 2nd uses softmax to normalize these scores into probabilities, which might offer smoother transitions and better exploration of options. Heuristic 11th is simpler but the special case for perfect fit is a good addition.

Comparing Heuristic 7th (FFD-inspired with penalty) vs. Heuristic 20th (Worst Fit), Heuristic 7th's approach of prioritizing bins with least remaining capacity is generally preferred in bin packing for tighter fits, whereas Worst Fit prioritizes largest remaining capacity which can lead to fragmentation.

Comparing Heuristic 10th and Heuristic 14th (both seem to be identical, "Best Fit with tie-breaking for perfect fit and worst fit"), they explicitly handle perfect fits with a bonus and provide a slight bonus for worst fits among available bins, which is more sophisticated than simple inverse remaining capacity.

Comparing Heuristic 17th, 18th, and 19th (all identical, Epsilon-Greedy) vs. Heuristic 11th/2nd, the epsilon-greedy approach introduces exploration, which can be beneficial for discovering better packing strategies over time, but it adds complexity and randomness.

Overall: The heuristics that aim for a "tight fit" (minimizing remaining capacity after placement), like 1st, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th, 19th, generally perform better than random or worst-fit strategies. Among these, those with explicit tie-breaking (like 10th/14th) or more nuanced scoring (like softmax in 2nd) show potential for better performance. Epsilon-greedy strategies offer exploration but introduce randomness.

**Experience:**
Heuristics that prioritize filling bins tightly (minimizing post-placement remaining capacity) tend to perform better. Explicitly handling perfect fits with a bonus and using techniques like softmax for scoring can improve performance. Introducing exploration (like epsilon-greedy) can be beneficial for adaptive strategies but adds complexity. Random and worst-fit strategies are generally less effective.
