{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize complex, multi-objective heuristics that balance exploitation (tight fitting, perfect fits) with nuanced exploration (guided exploration, probabilistic choices). Explicitly penalize undesirable outcomes (large residuals) and reward specific desirable states (perfect fits). Simpler heuristics like pure Best Fit or basic epsilon-greedy perform less effectively. Random strategies are generally poor.\nHeuristics that prioritize filling bins tightly (minimizing post-placement remaining capacity) tend to perform better. Explicitly handling perfect fits with a bonus and using techniques like softmax for scoring can improve performance. Introducing exploration (like epsilon-greedy) can be beneficial for adaptive strategies but adds complexity. Random and worst-fit strategies are generally less effective.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
