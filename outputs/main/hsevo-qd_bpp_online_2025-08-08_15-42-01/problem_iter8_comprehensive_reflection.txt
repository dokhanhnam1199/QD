Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, guided exploration, adaptive scoring, explicit penalties/rewards, exploration-exploitation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that dynamically evaluate candidate solutions across multiple criteria (e.g., tightness, future usability) and use intelligent sampling strategies rather than random choices.
*   **Avoid:** Purely greedy approaches, static scoring, and random exploration that doesn't leverage learned information or problem structure.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics learn from past performance, balancing exploration of new strategies with exploitation of known good ones. This involves refining evaluation metrics and guiding search towards promising regions of the solution space.
