{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nHeuristics that prioritize filling bins tightly (minimizing post-placement remaining capacity) tend to perform better. Explicitly handling perfect fits with a bonus and using techniques like softmax for scoring can improve performance. Introducing exploration (like epsilon-greedy) can be beneficial for adaptive strategies but adds complexity. Random and worst-fit strategies are generally less effective.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
