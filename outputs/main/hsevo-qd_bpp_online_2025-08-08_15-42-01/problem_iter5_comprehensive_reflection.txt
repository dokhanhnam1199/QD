Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective optimization, guided exploration, adaptive reward functions, hybrid strategies.
*   **Advice:** Focus on iterative refinement of multi-objective heuristics, dynamically adjusting exploration/exploitation based on problem state.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on static or purely greedy approaches; neglecting the interplay between penalizing poor fits and rewarding ideal fits.
*   **Explanation:** By viewing heuristic design as a continuous learning process, you can better identify optimal trade-offs between thorough exploration and efficient exploitation, leading to more robust and performant solutions.
