Fewer neighbors, stronger penalties, and simpler combinations often improve TSP heuristic performance.

Focus on strong nearest neighbor bonuses, farthest neighbor penalties, and aggressive sparsification for improved TSP heuristics.

Focus on stronger nearest neighbor bonuses, direct farthest neighbor penalties, and robust normalization after sparsification.

Focus on stronger, direct neighbor bonuses/penalties, simpler combination, and robust normalization after sparsification.

Equal weighting and a combined view are generally better, avoid hardcoded weights if possible.

Both codes are identical. Explore different sparsification and normalization strategies for potentially better heuristics.

Focus on stronger nearest neighbor bonuses/farthest neighbor penalties, simpler combinations, and aggressive sparsification.

Fewer neighbors, stronger penalties, and simpler combinations improve TSP heuristic performance.

Both versions are identical. Explore better penalty/bonus weights and more sophisticated combination strategies.

Fewer neighbors, stronger penalties, and adjusted weights improved performance. Explore more tailored weight tuning.
