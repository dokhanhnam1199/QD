Combining inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonus, farthest neighbor penalty, sparsification, and normalization improves edge selection.

The better code combines inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonus, farthest neighbor penalty, and sparsification for improved TSP heuristic.

The better code combines inverse distance, neighbor bonuses/penalties, and sparsification for improved edge selection.

The better code combines inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonus, farthest neighbor penalty and sparsification for improved heuristic guidance.

Consider edge diversity, global tour properties, and adaptive weighting of heuristics. Sparsity is good.
