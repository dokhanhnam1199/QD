    """
    Heuristic function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that combines
    multiple factors to determine the likelihood of including an edge in a solution.
    This version incorporates dynamic weight tuning and refined sparsification.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A 2D numpy array representing the distance
            matrix between cities.  distance_matrix[i][j] is the distance
            between city i and city j.

        np.ndarray: A 2D numpy array of the same shape as distance_matrix,
            where each element represents the prior probability or desirability
            of including the corresponding edge in a TSP tour.
