Exploration-exploitation balance: combine distance, neighbors, penalties. Sparsity and normalization help guide search.

The improved heuristic combines inverse distance, nearest neighbors, farthest neighbor penalty, sparsification, and normalization.

Fewer nearest neighbors, stronger farthest neighbor penalties, and adjusted weights improve performance.

Combining inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonus, and farthest neighbor penalty, with sparsification and normalization, improves TSP heuristic quality.

Combine diverse factors: distance, neighbors, penalties. Sparsify and normalize. Tune weights adaptively.

Combining inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonus, farthest neighbor penalty, and sparsification improves TSP heuristic design.

Fewer neighbors, stronger penalties, and simpler combinations improve TSP heuristic performance.

Removing heuristic weights and directly summing components likely improved performance. Consider exploring alternative normalization methods.

Fewer neighbors, stronger penalties, and simplified weighting improve heuristic quality.

Combining multiple factors, nearest neighbor bonuses, distance penalties, and sparsification improve heuristic quality.
