The better heuristic combines inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonus, farthest neighbor penalty, and sparsification.

Fewer neighbors, stronger penalties, adjusted weights, and sparsity improve heuristic performance.

Equal weighting performs better than pre-defined weights. Consider adaptive or learned weights for combining heuristics.

Penalize long edges more strongly. Sparsify intelligently (e.g., mean). Use softmax for normalization.

Penalize farther neighbors more strongly, sparsify based on the mean, and use softmax normalization.

The better code uses unweighted heuristic combination. Consider adaptive weights or new heuristics for improvement.

Focus on strong neighbor signals, aggressive sparsification, and robust normalization like row-wise softmax.

Focus on strong neighbor bonuses/penalties, simpler combinations, aggressive sparsification, and robust normalization for improved heuristic design.

Consider graded neighbor bonuses/penalties, adaptive sparsification, and softmax normalization for contrast.

Focus on strong, direct incentives/penalties, simpler combinations, and robust normalization with increased sparsification.
