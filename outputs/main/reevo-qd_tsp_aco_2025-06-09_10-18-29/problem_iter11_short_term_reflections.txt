The better heuristic combines distance, neighbors, sparsification, and normalization for informed edge selection.

Focus on immediate neighbors, aggressive sparsification, robust normalization, and simpler combinations of heuristics.

Prioritize immediate neighbors, aggressive sparsification, and robust normalization for better TSP heuristics.

Combine diverse factors (distance, neighbors, degree) with adaptive weighting and sparsification for better exploration.

Combine diverse heuristics, prioritize local information, sparsify, and normalize for robustness.

Graded neighbor bonuses, dynamic weighting, and adaptive sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Focus on immediate neighbors, aggressive sparsification, and robust normalization for improved heuristic design.

Prioritize neighbors, sparsify aggressively, and normalize rows robustly for effective TSP heuristics.

Combining inverse distance, nearest neighbor bonuses, and farthest neighbor penalties, followed by sparsification and softmax, improves TSP heuristics.

Focus on strong neighbor bonuses/penalties, aggressive sparsification, and robust normalization for improved TSP heuristics.
