**Analysis:**

*   **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Heuristic 1st introduces a quadratic penalty `-(gap**2)` and a linear term `lambda_param * fitting_bins_remain_cap`, aiming for a more nuanced score that balances tight fit with overall bin fullness. Heuristic 2nd also aims for multi-criteria but its explanation is more exploratory and less concrete in its final scoring logic within the docstring. The implementation of 1st seems to better reflect a specific, refined scoring strategy.

*   **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** Heuristic 3rd implements a simple binary "best fit" logic (1.0 for minimum difference, 0.0 otherwise), failing to provide graded priorities or consider overall bin fullness. Heuristic 4th attempts a multi-criteria approach with normalization and sigmoid activation, aiming for smoother, graded priorities, but its normalization and weighting logic can be complex and might not always yield the most intuitive results.

*   **Comparing (5th) vs (6th):** Heuristic 5th uses an exponential score based on the difference from the minimum difference, with a temperature parameter. Heuristic 6th uses Softmax on the negative differences, creating a probability distribution, which is a more standard approach for graded priorities in similar contexts. Heuristic 6th's Softmax implementation is generally more robust for generating graded priorities.

*   **Comparing (7th) vs (8th):** Heuristic 7th uses a simple `item - bins_remain_cap` score, which is a direct representation of tightest fit but can lead to large negative values. Heuristic 8th uses `1.0 / (differences + 1e-9)` and explicitly assigns `inf` to perfect fits, offering a clearer "best fit" prioritization.

*   **Comparing (9th) vs (10th):** Heuristic 9th uses a simple `1.0 / proximity` for fitting bins, prioritizing the tightest fit. Heuristic 10th attempts to combine this with a quadratic penalty `-(differences**2)`, aiming to penalize larger gaps more heavily while still favoring tight fits. Heuristic 10th's multi-faceted scoring is more sophisticated.

*   **Comparing (11th) vs (12th):** Heuristic 11th is identical to Heuristic 10th. Heuristic 12th is identical to Heuristic 6th.

*   **Comparing (13th) vs (14th):** Heuristic 13th and 14th are identical. They use `exp(-diffs / temperature)` which is a Softmax-like approach focused on the tightest fit, controlled by temperature.

*   **Comparing (15th) vs (16th):** Heuristic 15th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th are all identical implementations of a simple "best fit" heuristic (`1 / (cap - item + 1e-9)`). Heuristic 16th (and its identical counterparts 13th/14th) uses a temperature-controlled exponential function on negative differences, which provides a smoother, graded priority distribution compared to the simple inverse of the difference.

*   **Overall:** Heuristics 1st, 10th/11th, and 13th/14th/16th/17th/18th/19th/20th show a progression. Heuristic 1st offers a good balance of tight fit and bin fullness. Heuristics 10th/11th attempt to penalize gaps quadratically. Heuristics 13th/14th/16th/etc. use a Softmax-like approach for graded priorities based on tightness. The simplest (and thus arguably worst for nuanced optimization) are the basic "best fit" heuristics (15th onwards). Heuristic 4th tries complex normalization and sigmoid, which might be overly complicated. Heuristic 3rd is too simplistic.

**Experience:**
Prioritize heuristics that offer multi-criteria scoring (e.g., fit, fullness). Employ graded priority mechanisms like Softmax or exponentials for smoother selection. Avoid overly simple binary or linear scoring. Penalize large gaps quadratically or use nuanced functions. Test weightings and parameters.
