**Analysis:**
*   **Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 13/16:** Heuristic 1 uses a loop for calculation, while 13 and 16 achieve the same result using vectorized NumPy operations (`1 / (cap - item + 1e-9)` applied element-wise). Vectorization is generally more efficient in Python with NumPy. Heuristic 12 and 15 are similar to 13/16 but add comments and slightly different variable names. Heuristic 8 takes absolute difference which is not ideal for prioritizing tighter fits (a bin with -1 difference is worse than a bin with +1 difference, but `abs` makes them equal). Heuristic 8 also applies the `can_fit_mask` *after* calculating inverse absolute difference, which is less clean than filtering first.
*   **Heuristic 2/6/10 vs. Heuristic 4/14/17:** Heuristics 2, 6, and 10 are identical. They use a sigmoid function applied to normalized inverse proximity scores. Heuristic 4, 14, and 17 are also identical and very similar to 2/6/10, also using sigmoid and normalization. The difference lies in how normalization is performed. 4/14/17 normalize based on `(inverse_proximity - min) / (max - min)`, aiming to center around 0.5 for the sigmoid. 2/6/10 normalize by dividing by the max inverse proximity, effectively scaling to [0, 1] where 1 is the tightest fit. The explicit handling of perfect fits (priority = 1.0) in 2/6/10/4/14/17 is a good addition for ensuring these are always prioritized. The logic in 2/6/10/4/14/17 seems more robust and nuanced than simpler inverse proximity.
*   **Heuristic 7 vs. Heuristic 11/17:** Heuristic 7 uses a Softmax on negative differences (`-(eligible_capacities - item)`), which effectively prioritizes bins with small remaining capacity after fitting the item. This is a strong approach. Heuristics 11 and 17 are identical and also use a `temperature` parameter with `exp(-diffs / temperature)`. This is conceptually similar to Softmax but returns raw scores proportional to the softmax probabilities, which is often sufficient for selection. Heuristic 17 also includes `1.0 / valid_capacities` logic which is then commented out or seemingly superseded by the `exp(-diffs / temperature)` part. The `temperature` parameter offers a tunable knob.
*   **Heuristic 3 vs. Heuristic 9:** Heuristic 3 uses `item - bins_remain_cap` for fitting bins, resulting in negative priorities. Higher values (closer to 0) are better fits. Heuristic 9 aims to combine tight fit (`item - bins_that_fit_cap`) with fullness (`1.0 / (bins_that_fit_cap - item + epsilon)`). This combination is more complex and potentially captures more desired behavior by rewarding both tight fits and already full bins (which might imply less residual capacity for future items). Heuristic 3 is simpler but might not exploit the "already full" aspect as well.
*   **Heuristic 5 vs. Others:** Heuristic 5 uses a simple "best fit" approach by identifying the minimum difference and assigning a priority of 1.0 only to bins with that minimum difference, and 0.0 otherwise. This is a greedy, non-smooth approach, unlike the graded priorities offered by inverse proximity or sigmoid functions in other heuristics. It doesn't differentiate between multiple "best fit" bins, nor does it provide a soft preference for slightly less optimal fits.
*   **Heuristic 18/19/20 vs. Others:** These are identical and use a sigmoid on normalized gaps. The normalization is `gaps / np.max(remaining_capacities_of_suitable_bins)`. This differs from heuristics 2/6/10/4/14/17 by normalizing based on the *maximum remaining capacity* among suitable bins, rather than the inverse proximity scores. This could lead to different shaping of the priority distribution. The fallback to `0.5` when all priorities are zero is a good fallback for uniform preference in such edge cases.
*   **Overall Comparison:** Heuristics like 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20 offer more sophisticated ways to generate graded priorities, often using sigmoid or exponential functions on derived scores (like inverse proximity or differences). These provide smoother exploration and can balance multiple objectives (tight fit, bin fullness). Simple inverse proximity (1, 12, 13, 15, 16) is a solid baseline. Heuristics like 3 and 9 attempt to combine factors but might be less standard. Heuristic 5 is too simplistic and binary. Heuristics 18/19/20's normalization approach is a variation worth noting. The use of `np.any` and vectorized operations is generally preferred over explicit loops.

**Experience:**
Prioritize vectorized NumPy operations for efficiency. Graded priority scores using inverse proximity or sigmoid/exponential functions offer smoother, more nuanced decisions than binary assignments. Combining criteria like "tight fit" and "bin fullness" can lead to more robust heuristics. Tunable parameters (like temperature for exp/sigmoid) can adapt heuristics to problem specifics.
