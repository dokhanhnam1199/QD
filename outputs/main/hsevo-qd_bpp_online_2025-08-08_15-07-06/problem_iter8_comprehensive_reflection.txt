Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflection:

*   **Keywords:** Granular scoring, weighted combinations, smooth transitions, vectorized operations, tunable parameters, empirical validation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on building heuristics that provide graded preferences rather than strict binary choices. Combine multiple relevant criteria using weighted sums or similar functions, adjusting weights based on empirical performance. Utilize smooth mapping functions (like scaled inverse or sigmoid) to translate raw metrics into nuanced scores.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single, direct metrics without considering secondary factors. Complex, unjustified transformations or overly complicated meta-heuristics without empirical backing. Ignoring bin eligibility.
*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes creating heuristics that capture the "degree" of fitness and preference, leading to more adaptive and robust solutions. Smooth transitions prevent abrupt changes in heuristic behavior, and empirically validating parameter choices ensures effectiveness.
