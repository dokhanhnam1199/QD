Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-criteria, graded scoring, tunable parameters, nuanced penalties, vectorized operations.
*   **Advice:** Focus on composite scoring functions that blend multiple criteria (fit, fullness, etc.) using smooth, non-linear mappings (e.g., exponentials, sigmoid). Tune parameters to adapt to problem characteristics. Leverage vectorized operations for performance.
*   **Avoid:** Overtly simple binary or linear scoring. Unjustified complex transformations without empirical evidence. Ignoring edge cases or bin eligibility.
*   **Explanation:** Nuanced scoring and tunable parameters allow heuristics to capture subtle trade-offs and adapt to diverse problem instances, leading to more effective and robust solutions than blunt, oversimplified approaches.
