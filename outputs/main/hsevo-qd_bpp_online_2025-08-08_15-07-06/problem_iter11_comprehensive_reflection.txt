Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-criteria, Non-linear scoring, Edge cases, Adaptability, Vectorization.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how multi-criteria scoring can be made *adaptive* through tunable parameters (like temperature) and robust to edge cases.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic heuristics that fail to capture nuanced trade-offs or are brittle to variations.
*   **Explanation:** Aim for heuristics that are both computationally efficient (vectorized) and capable of nuanced, adaptable decision-making by leveraging non-linear transformations and explicitly managing extreme scenarios.
