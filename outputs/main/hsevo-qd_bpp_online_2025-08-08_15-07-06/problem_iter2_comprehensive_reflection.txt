Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Simplicity, Transparency, Empirical Validation, Targeted Exploration.
*   **Advice:** Focus on constructing heuristics with easily understandable mechanics and clear justifications for their components. Prioritize simple rules that can be incrementally enhanced.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, opaque mathematical functions without demonstrable performance gains. Avoid "black box" heuristic components.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to build heuristics that are debuggable and adaptable. Understanding *why* a heuristic makes a choice is crucial for identifying limitations and designing targeted improvements, rather than relying on blind experimentation with complex mechanisms.
