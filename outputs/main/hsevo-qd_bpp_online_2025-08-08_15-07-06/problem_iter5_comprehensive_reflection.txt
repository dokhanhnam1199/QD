Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Granular scoring, multi-criteria fusion, adaptive parameterization, empirical validation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on creating finely-grained, multi-dimensional scoring mechanisms that integrate diverse criteria (e.g., fit, fullness, strategic placement) through weighted sums or more complex fusion methods.
*   **Avoid:** Binary or overly simplistic preference assignments. Avoid introducing complex mathematical transformations without a clear, demonstrable benefit to heuristic performance on the specific problem.
*   **Explanation:** By moving beyond single metrics and embracing nuanced, combined scoring, heuristics can capture a richer understanding of the problem space, leading to more intelligent and adaptive decision-making, especially when validated against real-world or simulated problem instances.
