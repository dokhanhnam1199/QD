{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, direct heuristics like inverse proximity for \"best fit.\" Softmax-based methods offer sophisticated probability distributions. Epsilon-greedy adds exploration. Avoid overly complex transformations (like sigmoid without clear benefit) unless empirically justified. Explicitly handle ineligible bins.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
