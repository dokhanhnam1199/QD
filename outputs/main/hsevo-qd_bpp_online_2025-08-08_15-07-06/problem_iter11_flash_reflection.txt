**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (multi-criteria with quadratic penalty and linear fullness term) with Heuristic 8 (simple `item - bins_remain_cap`), we see that Heuristic 1 attempts a more nuanced approach by penalizing larger gaps quadratically and considering overall bin fullness, which is a richer scoring mechanism than the linear best-fit of Heuristic 8.

Comparing Heuristic 2 (multi-criteria fusion with weights) with Heuristic 5 (normalized multi-criteria fusion with sigmoid), Heuristic 2 uses a direct weighted sum (`item - 0.5 * bins_remain_cap`), while Heuristic 5 normalizes components and applies a sigmoid, aiming for smoother, graded priorities. Heuristic 5's normalization and sigmoid might offer more stable behavior across different input scales than Heuristic 2's direct weighting.

Comparing Heuristic 6 (normalized proximity and fullness with sigmoid) with Heuristic 12 (normalized inverse proximity with exponential decay), both use normalization and transformations. Heuristic 6 combines normalized proximity and fullness, whereas Heuristic 12 uses exponential decay on normalized proximity, potentially offering finer control over priority gradients.

Comparing Heuristic 11 (simple inverse proximity, infinite for perfect fit) with Heuristic 14 (simple inverse proximity, no special handling for perfect fit), Heuristic 11 explicitly rewards perfect fits with infinite priority, which is a stronger signal than Heuristic 14's consistent inverse proportionality.

Comparing Heuristic 13 (combined best-fit and excess capacity penalty via exp and multiplication) with Heuristic 18 (similar logic with `exp(-diffs/temp) * excess_capacity_scores`), both attempt to balance tight fit and penalizing large capacities. Heuristic 18's use of exponential scaling with temperature offers a potentially more controlled way to adjust the sensitivity to these factors compared to the multiplicative approach in Heuristic 13.

Overall: Higher ranked heuristics tend to incorporate multiple criteria (tight fit, bin fullness) and use more sophisticated scoring mechanisms (quadratic penalties, normalization, sigmoid/exponential transformations) for finer-grained control and robustness.

**Experience:**
Prioritize multi-criteria scoring for robust heuristics. Normalization and non-linear transformations (sigmoid, exponential) enhance score interpretability and stability. Explicitly handle edge cases like perfect fits or extreme values. Balance simplicity with the need for nuanced decision-making.
