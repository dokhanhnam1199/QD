**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 and Heuristic 4 (which are identical): They use a Softmax-based approach, prioritizing tighter fits. This is a sophisticated method that balances preferences well.

Comparing Heuristic 2 and Heuristic 8 (which are identical): These use an inverse proximity (1/proximity) strategy. This is a good heuristic that directly favors bins with less remaining space after fitting. The handling of `proximity == 0` with `float('inf')` is a strong indicator of a good fit.

Comparing Heuristic 3 and Heuristic 11, 14, 16 (which are similar): These use an inverse difference `1.0 / (np.abs(diffs) + 1e-9)`. This is similar to the inverse proximity, but the `np.abs()` is not strictly necessary if we filter for `bins_remain_cap >= item` first. The explicit masking to zero for ineligible bins is good.

Comparing Heuristic 5 and Heuristic 12, 13, 15 (which are very similar): Heuristic 5 uses `-differences + 1.0` for priority. This also favors tighter fits. The use of `-1.0` for ineligible bins is a clear indicator. The more complex versions (12, 13, 15) attempt to incorporate Softmax-like behavior or scaling with temperature, which can be beneficial but also adds complexity.

Comparing Heuristic 6 and Heuristic 7 (identical): These implement a "best fit" strategy by assigning a priority of 1.0 only to bins that achieve the minimum difference. This is a greedy approach that focuses on a single best option.

Comparing Heuristic 9 and Heuristic 10 (identical): These use an Epsilon-Greedy strategy. They exploit the best fit most of the time but explore randomly with a small probability. This can help escape local optima but adds a stochastic element.

Comparing Heuristic 19 and Heuristic 20 (identical): These use a sigmoid function based on normalized gaps. This is an interesting approach that attempts to create a smooth priority distribution but might be overly complex for a simple priority score.

Overall: Heuristics 1 and 4 (Softmax) and 2 and 8 (Inverse Proximity with infinity for perfect fit) appear to be the most robust and well-designed. Heuristics 3, 11, 14, 16 are good inverse difference strategies. Heuristic 5 is a clear and simple "best fit" variant. The Epsilon-Greedy (9, 10) offers exploration. The sigmoid-based ones (19, 20) and the strict "best fit" ones (6, 7, 17, 18) are less versatile or potentially over-engineered for a simple priority function. The complexity in 12, 13, 15 without clear justification for temperature scaling makes them less preferable than simpler inverse methods.

**Experience:**
Prioritize clear, direct heuristics like inverse proximity for "best fit." Softmax-based methods offer sophisticated probability distributions. Epsilon-greedy adds exploration. Avoid overly complex transformations (like sigmoid without clear benefit) unless empirically justified. Explicitly handle ineligible bins.
