**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1st (multi-criteria: tightness and fullness) with Heuristic 13th (similar multi-criteria but with Softmax scaling concept), we see that Heuristic 1st uses a simpler weighted sum `-(gap**2) + lambda_param * fitting_bins_remain_cap` which directly optimizes for small gaps and fuller bins. Heuristic 13th attempts to incorporate Softmax principles with `np.exp(-diffs / temperature)`, aiming for a more distributed priority if multiple bins are considered. Heuristic 1st seems more direct and interpretable for this problem.

Comparing Heuristic 4th and 7th (sigmoid on normalized inverse proximity) with Heuristic 8th, 9th, 12th (inverse proximity with infinite priority for perfect fits), we observe a trade-off. Heuristics 4th/7th use a sigmoid for smooth, distributed preferences, while 8th/9th/12th strongly favor exact fits by assigning `inf`. This strong preference might be desirable for consolidation but could ignore slightly less perfect but still good fits.

Comparing Heuristic 6th and 10th (binary: 1.0 for best fit, 0.0 otherwise) with Heuristic 14th and 16th (simple inverse proximity `1 / (cap - item + 1e-9)`), the simple inverse proximity (14th/16th) offers a more granular preference than the binary approach (6th/10th). The binary approach only distinguishes the absolute best fit, ignoring nuances between other suitable bins.

Comparing Heuristic 13th and 15th (Softmax-like exponential scaling of inverse difference) with Heuristic 17th (similar exponential scaling of inverse difference but with adjusted temperature and normalization), we see subtle differences in implementation. Heuristic 13th/15th use `np.exp(-diffs / temperature)` directly as priority, while 17th also calculates `1.0 / (valid_capacities - item + epsilon)` and then proceeds with the exponential scaling. The direct application of `exp(-diffs/temperature)` seems more straightforward for generating graded priorities.

Overall, heuristics that use a direct measure of "fit" (like inverse difference or squared difference) and scale it appropriately (like inverse proximity or exponential scaling) seem to offer better granularity and control than simple binary choices or less direct metrics. The inclusion of a secondary criterion, like overall bin fullness, as seen in Heuristic 1st, adds another dimension to consider.

**Experience:**
Prioritize granular scoring based on direct fit metrics (e.g., inverse difference). Combine primary fit criteria with secondary factors (like bin fullness) using weighted sums or scaled exponential functions for nuanced preferences. Avoid purely binary distinctions unless an absolute "best" is overwhelmingly critical. Smoothly transitioning scores (e.g., via inverse scaling or exponential mapping) often yield better results than abrupt cutoff points.
