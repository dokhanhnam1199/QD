{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize multi-criteria scoring for robust heuristics. Normalization and non-linear transformations (sigmoid, exponential) enhance score interpretability and stability. Explicitly handle edge cases like perfect fits or extreme values. Balance simplicity with the need for nuanced decision-making.\nPrioritize vectorized NumPy operations for efficiency. Graded priority scores using inverse proximity or sigmoid/exponential functions offer smoother, more nuanced decisions than binary assignments. Combining criteria like \"tight fit\" and \"bin fullness\" can lead to more robust heuristics. Tunable parameters (like temperature for exp/sigmoid) can adapt heuristics to problem specifics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, direct heuristics like inverse proximity for \"best fit.\" Softmax-based methods offer sophisticated probability distributions. Epsilon-greedy adds exploration. Avoid overly complex transformations (like sigmoid without clear benefit) unless empirically justified. Explicitly handle ineligible bins.\n\nPrioritize granular scoring based on direct fit metrics (e.g., inverse difference). Combine primary fit criteria with secondary factors (like bin fullness) using weighted sums or scaled exponential functions for nuanced preferences. Avoid purely binary distinctions unless an absolute \"best\" is overwhelmingly critical. Smoothly transitioning scores (e.g., via inverse scaling or exponential mapping) often yield better results than abrupt cutoff points.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
