    This function implements a "Best Fit" heuristic logic for online bin packing.
    It assigns a higher priority to bins that, after accommodating the item,
    would have the smallest remaining capacity. Bins where the item does
    not fit are assigned a very low (negative infinity) priority.

        bins_remain_cap: Array of current remaining capacities for each bin.

        The bin with the highest priority score is the "best fit".

    # potential remaining capacity. For example:
    # - If remaining capacity is 1, priority is -1.
    # - If remaining capacity is 5, priority is -5.
    # Since -1 > -5, the bin leaving 1 unit free will have a higher priority.
