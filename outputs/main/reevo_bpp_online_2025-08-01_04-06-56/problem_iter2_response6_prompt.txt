BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This version implements a \"Best Fit with Perfect Fit Bonus\" strategy for online Bin Packing.\n    It prioritizes bins based on the following hierarchy:\n    1. **Perfect Fit:** Bins where the item fits exactly, leaving zero remaining capacity. These are given\n       the highest possible priority to ensure they are chosen first.\n    2. **Best Fit (non-perfect):** Among bins where the item fits but does not result in a perfect fit,\n       priority is given to those that leave the smallest positive remaining capacity.
