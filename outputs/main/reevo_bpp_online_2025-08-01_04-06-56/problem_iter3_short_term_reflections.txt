Avoid overly aggressive bonuses; pure Best Fit naturally prioritizes perfect fits most efficiently.
Simplicity, where core heuristic naturally covers edge cases, often performs better. Avoid redundant, complex rules.
Avoid arbitrary, extreme bonuses; Best Fit inherently prioritizes perfect fits effectively.
Prioritize strict fit criteria for robustness. Simpler heuristics often outperform complex, specialized rules.
Beware of floating-point tolerance leading to invalid choices. Simpler, robust fit criteria often perform better than complex bonuses.
Avoid extreme, discontinuous bonuses. Pure Best Fit's continuous ranking inherently prioritizes perfect fits most effectively.
Simplicity often outperforms complex special cases in online problems. Avoid artificial over-prioritization of specific outcomes.
Avoid arbitrary, extreme bonuses; naturally integrate ideal cases into the primary heuristic's logic.
Simpler heuristics often perform better. Best Fit naturally prioritizes perfect fits; explicit bonuses can add unneeded complexity.
Simpler best-fit handles perfect fits naturally. Strict remaining capacity checks avoid invalid placements from floating-point inaccuracies.
