Prioritize feasibility, utilization, waste reduction, near-full/perfect-fit bins, and avoid near-empty bins.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and waste minimization. Add bonuses/penalties based on thresholds.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and waste minimization. Penalize near-zero capacity and large waste. Reward efficiency.

The better code uses feasibility checks, perfect fit bonuses, waste minimization, and near-full/empty bin considerations for improved heuristic design.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, waste minimization, efficiency, and near-full bin packing with tuned penalties/rewards.

Feasibility, perfect fit, waste minimization, near-full/empty bin considerations are crucial for effective bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and near-full bins. Penalize waste and near-zero capacity. Reward perfect fits.

The better code uses feasibility checks, utilization reward, waste penalty, and bonuses for near-full and perfect fits.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and waste minimization. Add bonuses for near-full bins and penalties for near-empty ones.

The better code incorporates feasibility checks, utilization rewards, and waste penalties for improved bin selection.
