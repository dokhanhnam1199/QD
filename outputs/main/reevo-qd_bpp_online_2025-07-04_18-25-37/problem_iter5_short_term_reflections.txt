Consider feasibility, waste minimization, utilization, and capacity thresholds for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and minimizing waste. Add penalties and rewards based on thresholds and efficiency.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, fill ratio prioritization, and perfect fit bonuses improve performance.

Feasibility, waste minimization, fill maximization, and handling edge cases are key to heuristic design.

The better code uses feasibility checks, utilization rewards, and waste penalties for improved bin selection.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, fill ratio maximization, and fit bonuses improve online bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and efficiency. Penalize waste and near-zero future capacity.

The better code incorporates feasibility, utilization rewards, and waste penalties with tuned hyperparameters, while the worse code uses a simple log ratio.

Consider feasibility, utilization, waste, and efficiency when designing bin-packing heuristics. Experiment with penalties and rewards.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and minimizing waste. Penalize near-zero capacity and large waste. Reward efficiency.
