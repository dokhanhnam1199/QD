The better code incorporates feasibility, utilization, waste management, and capacity proximity. Prioritize rule-based rewards and penalties over direct ratio comparisons.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, waste minimization, and bin utilization with careful penalty and reward scaling.

The better code incorporates feasibility, perfect fit bonus, utilization, waste minimization, and near-full/empty bin considerations.

The better code uses feasibility checks, utilization rewards, waste penalties, and bonuses for near-full/perfect fits.

The better code uses feasibility checks, waste minimization, efficiency reward, and near-full bin bonuses for improved performance.

The better code uses feasibility checks, waste minimization, and utilization rewards, unlike the ratio-based approach.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and waste minimization. Add bonuses for perfect fits and penalties for near-empty bins.

The better code incorporates feasibility, perfect fit bonuses, waste minimization, and near-full/empty bin considerations.

Better heuristics: Feasibility check, perfect fit bonus, utilization reward, waste penalty, near-full/empty bin considerations.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and minimizing waste. Add bonuses for near-full bins and penalties for exceeding thresholds.
