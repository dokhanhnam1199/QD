Feasibility checks, waste minimization, utilization rewards, and capacity thresholds improve bin selection.

Feasibility checks, utilization metrics, waste minimization, and capacity thresholds improve bin selection.

The better code incorporates feasibility, waste minimization, utilization, and penalizes near-empty bins.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and waste. Introduce penalties/rewards based on thresholds and efficiency.

Better heuristics consider feasibility, utilization, waste minimization, and efficiency with tuned penalties/rewards.

Better heuristics use feasibility checks, remaining capacity utilization, waste minimization, and efficiency rewards.

The improved code uses feasibility checks, capacity utilization, waste minimization, and efficiency rewards for bin selection.

The better code considers feasibility, utilization, waste, and efficiency for nuanced bin selection.

Better heuristics consider feasibility, utilization, waste minimization, and efficiency with tuned penalties/rewards.

Consider feasibility, waste minimization, utilization maximization, and penalizing near-empty bins after placement.
