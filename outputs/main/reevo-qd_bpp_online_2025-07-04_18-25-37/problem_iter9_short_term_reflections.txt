Feasibility checks, utilization rewards, waste penalties, and capacity proximity bonuses improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, fill-ratio prioritization, and fit bonuses improve online bin packing.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, utilization maximization, and "almost full" bin bonuses improve online bin packing.

Feasibility, waste minimization, fill rate maximization, and perfect fit bonuses improve performance.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, efficiency rewards, and capacity thresholds improve bin packing heuristics.

Consider feasibility, waste minimization, utilization maximization, and tunable hyperparameters for refined control.
