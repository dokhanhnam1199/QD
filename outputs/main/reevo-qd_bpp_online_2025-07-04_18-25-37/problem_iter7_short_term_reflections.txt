The better code uses feasibility checks, waste minimization, efficiency, and bin-closing bonuses for improved heuristic design.

Feasibility, waste minimization, fill ratio maximization, and perfect fit bonuses are crucial for bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility checks, waste minimization, efficiency maximization, and capacity thresholding improve bin packing.

Feasibility checks, utilization rewards, waste penalties, and capacity proximity bonuses improve bin packing heuristics.

Consider feasibility, waste minimization, fill ratios, and perfect fit bonuses. Penalize infeasibility, large waste, and near-empty bins.

The better code incorporates feasibility checks, utilization rewards, and waste penalties, and capacity proximity bonus while the worse one uses only log ratios.

The better code uses explicit rewards/penalties based on feasibility, utilization, and waste, outperforming simple ratio-based priorities.

Consider feasibility, utilization, waste, and proximity. Explicit rewards/penalties and hyperparameter tuning are helpful.

The better code uses feasibility checks, waste minimization, efficiency reward, and near-full bin bonus for improved performance.

Better heuristics consider feasibility, utilization, waste minimization, and efficiency with carefully tuned weights.
