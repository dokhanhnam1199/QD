Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

(2nd best) vs (19th) is the same. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the optimal weights can vary significantly based on the problem. (3rd) vs (4th) is the same. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst uses a combination of factors, but with fixed weights and a simplified nearly full condition, while the worst is a simple log ratio. Overall: Good heuristics use weighted combinations of multiple factors tailored to the problem, while bad heuristics oversimplify or use inappropriate metrics. Tuning weights is crucial.\n- \nOkay, I'll help you refine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics. Here's a redefined approach, focusing on actionable steps and avoiding pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Mechanism, Rationale, Adaptation, Evaluation.\n\n*   **Advice:** Instead of just \"tuning weights,\" focus on understanding the *mechanism* by which each factor influences the outcome. Define a *rationale* for why these factors are important *before* optimization. Build in *adaptation* mechanisms to adjust to changing conditions. Rigorously *evaluate* performance across diverse problem instances.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors without understanding their interaction. Treating weight tuning as a magical solution. Ignoring the underlying problem structure. Overfitting to specific data.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a deep understanding of the problem and the factors influencing the solution. Focus on building heuristics with clear rationales, adaptable mechanisms, and robust evaluation, rather than simply tweaking weights.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
