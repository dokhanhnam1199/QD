**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of capacity, waste, fragmentation, empty bin considerations, and dynamic adjustments, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that the second best considers all those factors as well and allows for tunable weights. However, it is missing the dynamic adjustments. The second worst also uses capacity, waste, fragmentation, and empty bin considerations. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best has adaptive waste thresholding and a dynamic penalty. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that the 3rd does not have any hyperparameter tuning, whereas the 4th does. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst takes into account more factors. Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors, dynamically adjust their calculations based on the context, and allow for tunable weights.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, consider multiple factors, adaptive weighting, dynamic adjustments based on context, tunable hyperparameters, consider penalizing fragmentation, and reward better bin utilization globally. Avoid relying on a single ratio.
