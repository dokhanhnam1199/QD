**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first one takes into account sufficient capacity, minimizes waste, prevents fragmentation, considers small amounts of available capacity, and gives preference to empty bins, while the last one only uses a log ratio calculation.
(2nd best) vs (second worst) This pair is the same.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical.
(3rd) vs (4th) This pair is the same.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical.
Comparing (6th) vs (7th), we see 6th heuristic only considers sufficient capacity and minimizes waste with a slightly added capacity ratio heuristic, while the 7th one considers "nearly full" heuristic, "small amount of available capacity" heuristic, and "Give higher preference if it is an empty bin" heuristic.
Comparing (10th) vs (11th), the 10th heuristic implements a more refined approach, including feasibility check, waste minimization, fragmentation avoidance by balancing bin usage around the median capacity, prioritization of emptier bins for larger items, and introduces a degree of randomness. The 11th heuristic is similar to other middle ranked heuristics.
Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors (sufficient capacity, waste minimization, fragmentation, small capacity, and empty bins) and assign weights or priorities to each factor. They also incorporate scaling and clipping to prevent negative values and randomness to break ties and explore the solution space. The worst ones oversimplify, focusing on ratio calculations or single factors without considering the interplay between them. Good heuristics also include feasibility checks to make sure the item can actually fit in the bin.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, assign weights to each factor based on their importance, and incorporate scaling and clipping to ensure values remain within a reasonable range. Randomness can help to avoid local optima. Remember to perform feasibility checks early.
