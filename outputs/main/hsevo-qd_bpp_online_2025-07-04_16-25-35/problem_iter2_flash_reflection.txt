**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first heuristic uses a combination of different bin-packing strategies (sufficient capacity, minimizing waste, preventing fragmentation, small remaining capacity, and preferring empty bins) with assigned weights, while the last heuristic simply calculates the negative logarithm of the ratio between the item size and remaining bin capacity. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no difference. This pattern continues for subsequent heuristics up to the 10th. From the 11th to 20th heuristics, the same ratio-based approach is repeated. Overall, the initial heuristics are more comprehensive, incorporating multiple factors, and using hardcoded weights, while the later heuristics are simplistic, relying only on capacity ratios.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and assigning weights based on their importance. A more complex, multi-faceted approach often outperforms a simple, single-factor heuristic. Parameter tuning is very important and needs to be performed carefully.
