Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Prioritize understanding the problem structure before assigning weights. Emphasize adaptive learning mechanisms in the heuristic.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on parameter tuning without theoretical grounding. Generic advice about combining factors without specifying the underlying rationale.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on understanding *why* factors are important, how they interact, and how the heuristic can learn and adapt based on the problem's specific characteristics, rather than solely relying on parameter optimization.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
