Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) also follows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see these two are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that the 4th one introduces adaptive waste threshold, penalizes bins that cannot fit item and reward higher bin utilization globally. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the ratio of item to capacity remain the same, which might have contributed to its lower performance. Overall: the best performing heuristics consider multiple factors and weights to balance different objectives when determining the priority of bins. Adaptive thresholds and penalization further fine-tune the bin selection process.\n- \nOkay, I'm ready to redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective for heuristic design. Here's a breakdown designed to avoid common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Factor Prioritization, Adaptive Strategies, Performance Feedback, Solution Diversity.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on iteratively refining factor *prioritization* based on observed performance. Implement adaptive *strategies* responding to runtime conditions. Build a *feedback* mechanism based on performance. Encourage *solution diversity* during the search.\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors and tuning weights without understanding their interplay. Generic normalization without considering problem-specific scales.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires understanding how factors influence performance *in practice*, not just in theory. Adaptive strategies are key for robustness.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
