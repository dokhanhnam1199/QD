Okay, I'm ready to help you design better heuristics! Let's redefine self-reflection, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding generic advice.

Here's a revised approach to 'Current Self-Reflection':

*   **Keywords:** Problem-specific factors, Adaptive strategies, Solution space exploration, Performance tuning.
*   **Advice:** Focus on identifying and encoding *problem-specific* knowledge into heuristics. Develop *adaptive strategies* based on *runtime information* or observed solution characteristics, instead of just static instance features. Actively test different weightings, and explore neighborhood structures and solution space thoroughly.
*   **Avoid:** Generic "consider multiple factors," vague notions of "importance," and untargeted randomness.
*   **Explanation:** Shift from general principles to concrete actions. Emphasize leveraging runtime data and tailoring the search process to the specific problem at hand. Focus on generating and evaluating diverse solutions.
