Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective approaches.

Here's a refined perspective:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Experimentation, Evaluation, Refinement.
*   **Advice:** Systematically experiment with different factor combinations and weighting schemes. Continuously evaluate heuristic performance on diverse problem instances. Adapt the heuristic based on observed performance patterns.
*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "importance," premature optimization, and lack of rigorous testing.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond intuition. Focus on iterative improvement through data-driven insights. Don't over-optimize early. Experiment, measure, adapt.
