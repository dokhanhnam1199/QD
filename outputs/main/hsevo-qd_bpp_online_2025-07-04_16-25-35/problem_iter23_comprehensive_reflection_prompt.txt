{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, use adaptive weights based on problem characteristics (e.g., item size), and introduce a degree of randomness to explore the solution space better. Avoid relying on single metrics or overly simplistic calculations.\nEmploy a combination of relevant factors and optimize their weights. Consider including sufficient capacity, waste minimization, fragmentation prevention, and bin utilization. Carefully tune weights with an optimization algorithm to find the best performance of a heuristic.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and assigning weights based on their importance. A more complex, multi-faceted approach often outperforms a simple, single-factor heuristic. Parameter tuning is very important and needs to be performed carefully.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, assign weights to each factor based on their importance, and incorporate scaling and clipping to ensure values remain within a reasonable range. Randomness can help to avoid local optima. Remember to perform feasibility checks early.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Assign weights to these factors and explore dynamic adjustments based on instance characteristics. Normalize values where appropriate. Focus on a combination of local and global objectives.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, assign appropriate weights, and dynamically adjust based on problem state. Incorporate penalties for undesirable states. Don't make duplicate copies.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider multiple factors, adaptive weighting, dynamic adjustments based on context, tunable hyperparameters, consider penalizing fragmentation, and reward better bin utilization globally. Avoid relying on a single ratio.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors contributing to the objective. Assign weights to different factors to balance their importance. Adaptive thresholds based on item size or bin capacity can improve performance. Penalize undesirable states and reward desirable ones.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
