Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines capacity, waste, fragmentation, and empty bin considerations.\"\"\"\n\n    priority = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Sufficient capacity boost\n    sufficient_capacity = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priority[sufficient_capacity] += 1.8 #Sufficient cap weight\n\n    # Minimize waste boost\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    positive_waste = waste[waste >= 0]\n    if len(positive_waste) > 0:\n        min_waste = np.min(positive_waste)\n        min_waste_bins_idx = np.where(waste == min_waste)[0]\n        priority[min_waste_bins_idx] += 1.2  #Min waste weight\n\n    # Nearly full bin boost\n    nearly_full = (bins_remain_cap > 0.0) & (bins_remain_cap <= 1.1 * item) & (bins_remain_cap >= item) #threshold multiplier = 1.1\n    priority[nearly_full] += 2.4 #Nearly full weight\n\n    #Small capacity based on relative availability\n    small_cap = (bins_remain_cap >= item)\n    priority[small_cap] += (bins_remain_cap[small_cap] - item) / np.max(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    #Emptiness boost\n    is_empty = bins_remain_cap == np.max(bins_remain_cap)\n    priority[is_empty] += 0.7 #Empty bins weight\n\n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective approaches.\n\nHere's a refined perspective:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Experimentation, Evaluation, Refinement.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically experiment with different factor combinations and weighting schemes. Continuously evaluate heuristic performance on diverse problem instances. Adapt the heuristic based on observed performance patterns.\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about \"importance,\" premature optimization, and lack of rigorous testing.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond intuition. Focus on iterative improvement through data-driven insights. Don't over-optimize early. Experiment, measure, adapt.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
