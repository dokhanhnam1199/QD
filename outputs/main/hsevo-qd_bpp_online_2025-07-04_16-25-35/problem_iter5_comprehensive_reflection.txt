Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

*   **Keywords:** Cognitive biases, exploration-exploitation, adaptive learning, problem structure.
*   **Advice:** Explicitly acknowledge and mitigate cognitive biases. Prioritize understanding the problem structure before assigning weights. Emphasize adaptive learning mechanisms in the heuristic.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on parameter tuning without theoretical grounding. Generic advice about combining factors without specifying the underlying rationale.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on understanding *why* factors are important, how they interact, and how the heuristic can learn and adapt based on the problem's specific characteristics, rather than solely relying on parameter optimization.
