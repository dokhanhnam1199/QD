**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers sufficient capacity, waste minimization, nearly full bins, small capacity, and emptiness, assigning specific weights to each factor. The worst only calculates a priority based on the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity, thus lacks crucial considerations such as fragmentation and waste.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), they are similar to (best) vs (worst).
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, indicating that their performance is likely indistinguishable.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), again, both are identical.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both only use ratio of item/bin capacity but second worst use log while worst doesn't.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more features related to bin packing such as waste, nearly full status, and emptiness. Also, better heuristics include weight hyperparameter tuning. Simpler heuristics solely rely on capacity ratios and can be less effective because they ignore key aspects of bin packing that affect performance. Adaptive thresholds or utilization scores also seem beneficial.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Assign weights to these factors and explore dynamic adjustments based on instance characteristics. Normalize values where appropriate. Focus on a combination of local and global objectives.
