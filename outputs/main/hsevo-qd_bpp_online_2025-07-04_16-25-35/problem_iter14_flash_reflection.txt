**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers sufficient capacity, waste minimization, fragmentation avoidance (nearly full bins), small capacity handling, and empty bin prioritization, using carefully chosen weights. The worst heuristic only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity in bins, using a log transformation.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), these heuristics are identical.

Comparing (6th) vs (8th), these heuristics are identical.

Comparing (9th) vs (11th), these heuristics are identical.

Comparing (12th) vs (13th), these heuristics are identical.

Comparing (14th) vs (16th), these heuristics are identical.

Comparing (15th) vs (17th), these heuristics are identical.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst use `ratios = item / bins_remain_cap` and `log_ratios = np.log(ratios)` calculate simple ratio and log ratio, while the worst do the same.

Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors with weighted priorities, including capacity, waste, fragmentation, and bin utilization. They often include dynamic adjustments based on item size or bin state. Simpler heuristics that only consider capacity ratios or log ratios perform poorly. Penalizing bins that are close to full but cannot fit the item and rewarding global bin utilization are advanced strategies that improve performance. Giving tunable parameters is beneficial.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, assign appropriate weights, and dynamically adjust based on problem state. Incorporate penalties for undesirable states. Don't make duplicate copies.
