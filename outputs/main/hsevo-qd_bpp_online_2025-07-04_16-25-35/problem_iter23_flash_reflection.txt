**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers multiple factors like sufficient capacity, waste minimization, fragmentation prevention, and empty bin utilization, assigning weights to each. The worst heuristic only considers the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity using a log transformation. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows (2nd best) adds diversity encouragement with a random nudge, handles cases where no bins have sufficient capacity, and adaptively adjusts weights based on item size. (1st) vs (2nd), the second heuristic introduces adaptive weights based on item size and a small random nudge for diversity, potentially improving exploration of the solution space. (3rd) vs (4th), (3rd) uses hardcoded weights. In contrast, (4th) allows for customizable weights for different heuristics. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst uses a few heuristics, and the worst one use ratio of item to bins remain capacity and log transform. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors, adaptive weights, and sometimes a degree of randomization to avoid local optima. Simpler heuristics focusing on a single metric tend to perform worse.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, use adaptive weights based on problem characteristics (e.g., item size), and introduce a degree of randomness to explore the solution space better. Avoid relying on single metrics or overly simplistic calculations.
