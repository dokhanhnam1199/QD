**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a weighted combination of factors like sufficient capacity, waste minimization, fragmentation prevention, and empty bin preference, while the worst only considers the log ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (19th) is the same. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the optimal weights can vary significantly based on the problem. (3rd) vs (4th) is the same. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst uses a combination of factors, but with fixed weights and a simplified nearly full condition, while the worst is a simple log ratio. Overall: Good heuristics use weighted combinations of multiple factors tailored to the problem, while bad heuristics oversimplify or use inappropriate metrics. Tuning weights is crucial.

**Experience:**
Employ a combination of relevant factors and optimize their weights. Consider including sufficient capacity, waste minimization, fragmentation prevention, and bin utilization. Carefully tune weights with an optimization algorithm to find the best performance of a heuristic.
