**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of factors (sufficient capacity, minimize waste, nearly full bins, small capacity based on relative availability, and emptiness boost) with weights assigned to each factor, while the worst only uses the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) also follows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see these two are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that the 4th one introduces adaptive waste threshold, penalizes bins that cannot fit item and reward higher bin utilization globally. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the ratio of item to capacity remain the same, which might have contributed to its lower performance. Overall: the best performing heuristics consider multiple factors and weights to balance different objectives when determining the priority of bins. Adaptive thresholds and penalization further fine-tune the bin selection process.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors contributing to the objective. Assign weights to different factors to balance their importance. Adaptive thresholds based on item size or bin capacity can improve performance. Penalize undesirable states and reward desirable ones.
