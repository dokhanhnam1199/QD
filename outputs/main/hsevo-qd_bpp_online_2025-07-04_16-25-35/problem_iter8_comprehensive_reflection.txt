Okay, I'll help you refine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics. Here's a redefined approach, focusing on actionable steps and avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Mechanism, Rationale, Adaptation, Evaluation.

*   **Advice:** Instead of just "tuning weights," focus on understanding the *mechanism* by which each factor influences the outcome. Define a *rationale* for why these factors are important *before* optimization. Build in *adaptation* mechanisms to adjust to changing conditions. Rigorously *evaluate* performance across diverse problem instances.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors without understanding their interaction. Treating weight tuning as a magical solution. Ignoring the underlying problem structure. Overfitting to specific data.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a deep understanding of the problem and the factors influencing the solution. Focus on building heuristics with clear rationales, adaptable mechanisms, and robust evaluation, rather than simply tweaking weights.
