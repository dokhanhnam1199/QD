Okay, I understand the goal: to refine the concept of "Current self-reflection" for heuristic design, steering clear of the pitfalls outlined in "Ineffective self-reflection," to guide the creation of truly effective heuristics.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Domain-Specific, Trade-offs, Evaluation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that *adapt* to specific domain characteristics and problem instance features. Explicitly model and manage *trade-offs* between competing objectives. Rigorously *evaluate* performance across a diverse set of instances.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors and tuning weights without understanding the *underlying problem structure*. Avoid assuming complexity guarantees better performance.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of just adding factors, *understand* their interactions and create rules that are meaningful to problem at hand.
