Okay, here's a redefinition of "Current self-reflection" optimized for designing better heuristics, focusing on effectiveness:

*   **Keywords:** Holistic assessment, contextual weighting, iterative refinement, cognitive biases.
*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze the problem space, identify key features, develop multiple candidate heuristics, and rigorously test/compare them, while consciously mitigating personal biases.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting edge cases, and ignoring performance metrics.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves a structured process, recognizing the limitations of intuition and actively seeking data-driven feedback to refine heuristic designs iteratively.
