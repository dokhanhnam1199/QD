Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, specifically avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Contextual, Granularity, Optimization, Trade-offs, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust to problem instance characteristics at a finer granularity. Directly optimize weights and consider trade-offs between multiple competing objectives rather than simply assigning importance.
*   **Avoid:** Generic statements about multiple factors and weights.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply *considering* factors to actively *adapting* to them. Emphasize rigorous optimization of parameters and acknowledge the inherent trade-offs present in heuristic design. Validate against a diverse benchmark set.
