Okay, I'm ready to redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design. Here's a breakdown designed to avoid common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Factor Prioritization, Adaptive Strategies, Performance Feedback, Solution Diversity.
*   **Advice:** Focus on iteratively refining factor *prioritization* based on observed performance. Implement adaptive *strategies* responding to runtime conditions. Build a *feedback* mechanism based on performance. Encourage *solution diversity* during the search.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors and tuning weights without understanding their interplay. Generic normalization without considering problem-specific scales.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires understanding how factors influence performance *in practice*, not just in theory. Adaptive strategies are key for robustness.
