To design better heuristics, we need to redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords**: Best-fit strategy, nuanced handling, remaining capacity, normalization techniques
* **Advice**: Combine best-fit strategies with nuanced handling, and consider simple, focused strategies for effective heuristics.
* **Avoid**: Complex scoring systems, unnecessary normalization, repetitive code, and duplication.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity and nuanced handling of remaining capacity, we can create more effective heuristics that avoid the pitfalls of overly complex scoring systems and unnecessary normalization.
