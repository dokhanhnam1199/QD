**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that both use a similar best-fit strategy but differ in how they handle the remaining capacity after adding an item. The top heuristics tend to use a more nuanced approach to prioritizing bins, such as adding a bonus for bins that are nearly full or normalizing the priority scores. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic adds a small bonus to bins that are almost full, while the second heuristic normalizes the remaining capacity after adding the item. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a similar pattern, with the third heuristic enhancing priority for nearly full bins and the fourth giving a significant bonus to bins that would be filled to at least 90% capacity. Overall, the top heuristics tend to combine best-fit strategies with additional factors like remaining capacity and bonuses for nearly full bins, and they often normalize their priority scores.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, combine best-fit strategies with nuanced handling of remaining capacity and consider adding bonuses for nearly full bins, then normalize priority scores to ensure effective bin prioritization.
