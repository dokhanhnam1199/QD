```python

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is calculated based on the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size.
    A bin with a remaining capacity closest to the item size gets a higher priority, 
    while also considering the bin's remaining capacity relative to its initial capacity (assuming it's 1.0).
    If a bin has not enough capacity to hold the item, its priority is set to negative infinity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
