```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This version uses a heuristic that prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity for the item.
    The priority score is calculated as the negative of the absolute difference between the remaining capacity and the item size.
    This encourages the algorithm to pack the item into a bin that is as full as possible after packing.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the remaining capacity and the item size
    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
    
    # Calculate the priority score as the negative of the difference
    priority = -diff
    
    # Set the priority score to negative infinity for bins that cannot hold the item
    priority[bins_remain_cap < item] = -np.inf
    
    return priority
