**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic focuses on a simple yet effective strategy of prioritizing bins based on the remaining capacity closest to the item size. In contrast, the worst heuristic uses a more complex scoring system that doesn't perform as well. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the second-best heuristic combines the best-fit strategy with nuanced normalization, which is more complex than the first. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that giving a bonus to bins that are nearly full can be beneficial, but the 4th heuristic's approach is more complicated and slightly less effective. 
Overall, simpler and more focused strategies tend to perform better.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics often rely on simple, focused strategies rather than complex scoring systems, and avoiding unnecessary normalization can be beneficial.
