**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (Heuristics 1st) with the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a more sophisticated scoring system involving exponential normalization, whereas the worst heuristic uses a simple remaining capacity scoring. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, but the 1st heuristic normalizes scores using exponential function, while the 2nd doesn't. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that both use a form of best-fit strategy, but the 3rd heuristic directly uses the negative absolute difference, whereas the 4th normalizes the priority scores.
Overall, better heuristics tend to use more nuanced scoring systems and normalization techniques.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, use nuanced scoring systems and normalization techniques, such as exponential normalization, to effectively prioritize bins based on remaining capacity and item size.
