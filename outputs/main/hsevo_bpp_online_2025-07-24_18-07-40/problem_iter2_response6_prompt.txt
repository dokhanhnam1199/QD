Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the item can fit into the bin\n    valid_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)\n    \n    # Prioritize bins that have just enough capacity for the item (Best Fit strategy)\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins > 0, 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap, -1)\n    \n    # Return the priority score for each bin\n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    \n    The priority is calculated based on how well the item fits into the bin.\n    A higher priority is given to bins where the item fits perfectly or leaves a large remaining capacity.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item to each bin\n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Assign a very low priority to bins where the item doesn't fit\n    priority = np.where(remaining_cap_after_addition < 0, -1e10, \n                        # For bins where the item fits, the priority is the remaining capacity after addition\n                        # This encourages filling bins as much as possible\n                        remaining_cap_after_addition)\n    \n    # To further encourage using bins that are almost full, we can slightly increase the priority\n    # for bins with very small remaining capacity after adding the item\n    priority = np.where((remaining_cap_after_addition >= 0) & (remaining_cap_after_addition < item), \n                        priority + 1e-6, priority)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristic (Heuristics 1st) with the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a more sophisticated scoring system involving exponential normalization, whereas the worst heuristic uses a simple remaining capacity scoring. \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, but the 1st heuristic normalizes scores using exponential function, while the 2nd doesn't. \n(3rd) vs (4th) shows that both use a form of best-fit strategy, but the 3rd heuristic directly uses the negative absolute difference, whereas the 4th normalizes the priority scores.\nOverall, better heuristics tend to use more nuanced scoring systems and normalization techniques.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's rethink 'Current self-reflection'. Since 'Ineffective self-reflection' is None, we'll focus on enhancing the current approach. Here are the key takeaways:\n* **Keywords**: nuanced scoring, normalization, prioritization\n* **Advice**: Explore diverse normalization techniques and scoring systems to improve heuristic design.\n* **Avoid**: Over-reliance on a single scoring or normalization method.\n* **Explanation**: By incorporating varied techniques, we can develop more robust and adaptable heuristics, leading to improved performance and problem-solving capabilities.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
