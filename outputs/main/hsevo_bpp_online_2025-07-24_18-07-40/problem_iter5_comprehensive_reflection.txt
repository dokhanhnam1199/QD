To redefine 'Current self-reflection', let's first identify the overlapping and ineffective aspects.

* **Keywords**: Nuanced scoring, normalization, optimization
* **Advice**: Focus on creating diverse and context-specific scoring functions that can adapt to different problem domains.
* **Avoid**: Repetitive code, generic normalization techniques (like exponential normalization without consideration for context)
* **Explanation**: The original 'Current self-reflection' was not effective because it lacked specificity and adaptability, mirroring 'Ineffective self-reflection' in its suggestion to use exponential normalization without considering the context or problem specifics, thus not truly avoiding the pitfalls it aimed to.
