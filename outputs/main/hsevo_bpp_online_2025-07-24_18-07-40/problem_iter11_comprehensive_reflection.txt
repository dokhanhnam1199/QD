To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach:

* **Keywords**: Simple strategies, focused approaches, bin packing, unique techniques.
* **Advice**: 
    * Incorporate a best-fit strategy to optimize bin packing.
    * Consider bonuses for nearly full bins to maximize capacity utilization.
* **Avoid**: Complex scoring systems, unnecessary normalization, and repetitive code.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on simple, unique strategies and avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can design more effective heuristics that efficiently solve bin packing problems.
