To design better heuristics, let's rethink 'Current self-reflection'. Since 'Ineffective self-reflection' is None, we'll focus on enhancing the current approach. Here are the key takeaways:
* **Keywords**: nuanced scoring, normalization, prioritization
* **Advice**: Explore diverse normalization techniques and scoring systems to improve heuristic design.
* **Avoid**: Over-reliance on a single scoring or normalization method.
* **Explanation**: By incorporating varied techniques, we can develop more robust and adaptable heuristics, leading to improved performance and problem-solving capabilities.
