{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, combine best-fit strategies with nuanced handling of remaining capacity and consider adding bonuses for nearly full bins, then normalize priority scores to ensure effective bin prioritization.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, use nuanced scoring systems and normalization techniques, such as exponential normalization, to effectively prioritize bins based on remaining capacity and item size.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on nuanced scoring systems and normalization techniques. Avoid repetitive code and optimize scoring functions. Utilize techniques like exponential normalization to improve heuristic design.\n\nEffective heuristics often rely on simple, focused strategies rather than complex scoring systems, and avoiding unnecessary normalization can be beneficial.\n\nTo design better heuristics, incorporate a best-fit strategy, consider bonuses for nearly full bins, and normalize priority scores to ensure effective bin packing. Avoid duplication and focus on unique, nuanced strategies.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
