**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines best-fit strategy with a bonus for nearly full bins and normalizes the priority scores, whereas the worst simply uses the remaining capacity after adding the item as priority without normalization or bonus. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use a form of best-fit strategy, but (1st) includes a bonus for nearly full bins and normalization. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows duplication in code, indicating that (4th) is not an improvement over (3rd). 
Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), there's no significant difference, suggesting that they are essentially the same strategy.
(19th) vs (20th) again shows identical strategies, indicating no improvement.
Overall, top heuristics incorporate a combination of best-fit strategy, bonus for nearly full bins, and normalization, while the lower-ranked ones often lack these nuances or are duplicates.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, incorporate a best-fit strategy, consider bonuses for nearly full bins, and normalize priority scores to ensure effective bin packing. Avoid duplication and focus on unique, nuanced strategies.
