To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Simple, focused strategies
* **Advice**: Design heuristics with straightforward and targeted approaches
* **Avoid**: Nuanced scoring systems, normalization techniques, and repetitive code
* **Explanation**: By avoiding complex scoring and normalization, we can create more efficient and effective heuristics that prioritize simplicity and clarity, leading to better performance and design.
