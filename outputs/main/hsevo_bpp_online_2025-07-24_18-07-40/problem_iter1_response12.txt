```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements the First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) heuristic 
    with a twist. It prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity to hold 
    the item, and penalizes bins that would have a lot of remaining capacity 
    after the item is added.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item to each bin
    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Check if the item can fit in each bin
    item_fits = remaining_cap_after_addition >= 0
    
    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    # Bins that can fit the item and have just enough capacity are prioritized
    priority = np.where(item_fits, -remaining_cap_after_addition, -np.inf)
