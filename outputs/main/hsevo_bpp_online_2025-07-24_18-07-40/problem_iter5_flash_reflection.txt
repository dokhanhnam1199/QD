**Analysis:**
Comparing the best (Heuristics 1st) vs the worst (Heuristics 20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a more nuanced scoring system with exponential normalization, whereas the worst heuristic uses a repetitive and less optimized approach. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic directly uses negative absolute difference for best-fit strategy and then normalizes using exponential function, while the second heuristic uses a combination of difference and remaining capacity. 
(3rd) vs (4th) show similar patterns with nuanced scoring and normalization. 
Overall, top heuristics tend to have more sophisticated normalization techniques and nuanced scoring systems.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on nuanced scoring systems and normalization techniques. Avoid repetitive code and optimize scoring functions. Utilize techniques like exponential normalization to improve heuristic design.
