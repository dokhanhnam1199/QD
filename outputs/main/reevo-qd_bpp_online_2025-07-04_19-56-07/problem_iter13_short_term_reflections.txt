The better code prioritizes fitting items, minimizes waste, and handles overflow strategically, unlike the ratio-based approach.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize normalized waste, and penalize overflow, but prefer smaller overflows.

The better code prioritizes fitting bins (FFD-like), normalizes priorities, and handles overflows gracefully.

Exploiting domain knowledge (fit/waste) and prioritizing minimal waste/overflow significantly improves performance.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste and overflow. Give preference to bins with minimal waste.

Exploiting bin capacity, waste minimization, and fit/overflow separation improve heuristic performance.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste (normalized fill ratio), and penalize overflow proportionally.

Consider waste, overflow, and normalization. Prioritize fitting bins and penalize overflows proportionally.

Prioritize fitting; if no fit, minimize overflow. Normalize waste for finer-grained prioritization.

Prioritize fitting items, minimize waste, and handle overflow strategically. Consider both fit and overflow when assigning priorities.
