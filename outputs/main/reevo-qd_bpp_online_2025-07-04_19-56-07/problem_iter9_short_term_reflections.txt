Prioritize fitting items, minimize waste, and penalize overflow using inverse relationships.

Consider waste, prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste, and penalize overflow when no fit exists.

The better code prioritizes fitting items and minimizing waste/overflow, using a rule-based approach over a purely ratio-based one.

Prioritize fitting bins, then minimize normalized waste. Heavily penalize overflows, favoring smaller ones.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste/overflow. Explicitly handle fitting/overflow scenarios for better control.

Prioritize fitting items, minimize waste and overflow; consider overflow only when no fit is possible.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste/overflow. Give substantial rewards for best fits, and penalties for overflows.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste. Consider overflow only when no fitting bin exists.

Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste. Penalize overflow, but allow it when necessary, minimizing it.

Consider waste/overflow, prioritize fitting bins, and break ties by minimizing waste/overflow.
