Prioritize fitting items with minimal waste. Explicitly handle fitting and overflowing scenarios differently.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste/overflow. Consider both fitting and overflow amounts for a balanced approach.

Prioritize fitting items. Minimize waste and overflow when a fit isn't possible.

Prioritize fitting items; minimize waste and overflow when items don't fit. Consider First-Fit Decreasing principles.

Explicitly prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste, and penalize overflows effectively.

Explicitly modeling fitting, waste, and overflow yields superior bin selection compared to ratio-based approaches.

The better code prioritizes fitting items and minimizing waste/overflow, a crucial aspect for bin packing.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste, and handle overflow strategically with inverse proportion.

Explicitly fitting, minimizing waste, and only overflowing as a last resort improves performance.

Prioritize fitting items with minimal waste. Penalize overflows unless unavoidable, then minimize them.
