Prioritize fitting items, minimize waste and overflow. Consider penalizing overflow and rewarding minimal waste.

Consider waste minimization, fit/overflow differentiation, and prioritizing best fits over overflows.

Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste. Penalize overflow, but prefer bins with less overflow if no fit.

Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste; penalize overflows, but allow if necessary.

Consider waste, prioritize fitting bins, and penalize overflow for robust bin selection.

Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste. Penalize overflow, but allow it as a last resort with minimized overflow.

Prioritize fitting items, minimize waste, and penalize overflow when no fitting bin exists.

Consider waste, prioritize fitting bins, and penalize overflow to improve packing efficiency.

Consider waste, fit/overflow, and normalization. Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste and penalize overflow.
