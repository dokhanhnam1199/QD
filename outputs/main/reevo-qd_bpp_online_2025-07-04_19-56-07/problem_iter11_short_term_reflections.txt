Prioritize fitting. Minimize waste when it fits. Penalize overflow, especially if fitting bins exist.

Prioritize fitting bins based on waste. Normalize priorities within fitting/overflowing bins to scale the impact.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste, and penalize overflow. Adapt penalty based on fit availability.

Consider waste minimization, fitting item first, and normalizing priorities within fitting/overflowing bins.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste/overflow, and normalize priorities for stable selection.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste/overflow, and normalize priorities for better exploration.

Prioritize fitting items. Penalize waste and overflow, more heavily if no fit exists.

Consider waste minimization, fitting items first, and normalization for robust priority scaling.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste/overflow, and normalize priorities for better performance.

Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste. Penalize overflow; consolidate when possible.
