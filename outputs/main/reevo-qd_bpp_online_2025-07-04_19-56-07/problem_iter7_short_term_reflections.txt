Consider waste, fit, and overflow. Prioritize fitting bins with minimal waste; penalize overflows.

Consider waste minimization, bin utilization, and handling infeasibility with prioritized overflow.

Prioritize fitting items and minimizing waste/overflow. Employ large priority differences for better bin selection.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste, and handle overflow gracefully with inverse scaling.

Prioritize fitting items, minimize waste, and only consider overflow when necessary.

Consider waste, fit, and overflow. Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste, and penalize overflow for better performance.

Exploiting domain knowledge (fitting, waste) yields better heuristics than generic math transformations.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste/overflow, and differentiate overflow penalties for finer control.

Prioritize fitting bins, minimize waste and overflow. Use high/low priority scores for clear distinction.

Exploiting bin capacity directly and handling overflow explicitly improves packing efficiency.
