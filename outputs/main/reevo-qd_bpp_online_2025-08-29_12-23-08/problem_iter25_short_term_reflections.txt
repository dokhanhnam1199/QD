Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, penalize fragmentation, & favor non-empty bins—balance exploration & exploitation.
Prioritize larger rewards (exact fit), minimize waste, and avoid fragmentation—shape the priority landscape effectively.
Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize waste, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration & avoiding local optima.
Focus on bin suitability—exact fit first, then minimize wasted space; avoid complex penalties. 




Focus on waste minimization, fit, and smoothness; penalize near-full & wasteful bins gently.
Combine fit, utilization, and fullness penalties; prioritize partially filled bins, avoid near-full ones.




Prioritize exact/tight fits, penalize near-full bins—weighted scoring & difference analysis are key!

Prioritize simplicity & exploit problem specifics (exact fit). Combine strategies; avoid overly complex, adjustable functions.
Prioritize exact/best fits heavily, penalize invalid & full bins, & smooth waste calculations.
Combine exact-fit preference with a smoothness-inducing, capacity-aware scoring function & penalty.
