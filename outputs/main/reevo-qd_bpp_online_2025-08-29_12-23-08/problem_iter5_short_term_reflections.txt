Prioritize waste *and* fullness; avoid division by zero; consider bin utilization ratios.
Combine exploitation (best fit) with controlled exploration—sigmoid’s fit favors tightness, epsilon-greedy adds diversity.
Prioritize exact fits & minimize wasted space. Simple, strong heuristics often outperform complex ones.
Prioritize fit *and* avoid overly full bins; explore non-linear scoring like sigmoid for robustness.




Prioritize minimizing waste *and* consider bin fullness—avoid both very empty & very full bins.
Combine fit & bin-spreading; non-linear scoring (sigmoid) & penalties improve performance. Consider item-specific adjustments.




Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Avoid overly penalizing nearly-fit bins—use scaling!
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Small additions to priorities can significantly impact performance.
Prioritize fit *and* fullness; smooth scores with sigmoids; avoid zero-division. Consider bin age/history too!




Prioritize fit *and* bin utilization; avoid early commitment via penalties/shaping.
