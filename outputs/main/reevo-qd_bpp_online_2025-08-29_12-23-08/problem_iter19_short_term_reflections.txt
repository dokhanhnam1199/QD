Simplicity & relative scoring often outperform complex, absolute weighting schemes. Focus on *remaining* capacity.




Focus on minimizing remaining capacity & avoiding division by zero; simplicity often outperforms complex scoring.
Prioritize exact fits & smooth fit scores; consider bin fullness & adjust parameters.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, avoid fragmentation, and encourage partially filled bins—balance exploration & exploitation.




Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize waste, and explore via randomness—balance exploitation & exploration!
Prioritize fit *and* bin fullness; dynamically scale based on item size; avoid division by zero.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Simplicity often beats complex, weighted combinations.
Favor fit, penalize fullness, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration/exploitation balance.
Prioritize tighter fits, avoid complex scoring, and directly reflect remaining capacity—simplicity often wins.
Focus on feasibility, waste minimization, bin fullness, and exploration via randomness. Prioritize simpler, impactful features first.
