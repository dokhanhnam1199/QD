## BPP Heuristic Design - Constructive Hints (Refined):

Prioritize **exact/tight fits & minimal waste** above all. Balance **bin fullness** (penalize nearly-full). Favor **best-fit first**, then controlled random exploration (item-specific rates). **Simplicity** & direct space differences often win! Avoid scaling where possible.
