Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize waste, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.
Simplicity & direct fit are key. Avoid complex scoring; prioritize minimizing remaining space directly.
Prioritize exact fits, then best-fit; explore weighted combinations of remaining capacity & bin usage.




Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) & bin distribution (almost-full penalty) over rigid rules. Explore dynamic parameter adjustment.




Combine fit, utilization, & penalty terms; tune weights for optimal balance—avoid overly full bins.
Prioritize exploration & fit; avoid overly steep/sensitive functions; consider waste minimization directly.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and subtly penalize nearly-full bins for improved packing.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and avoid fragmentation—balance fullness & bin usage.
Prioritize fit *and* avoid overly full bins; sigmoid scaling is a strong approach.
Prioritize tightness & exact fits; combine scores effectively—dominance is key for better bin packing.
