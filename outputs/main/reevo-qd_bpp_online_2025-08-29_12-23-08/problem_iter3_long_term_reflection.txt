## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:

**Focus:** Exact fits & minimal waste are paramount. Use sigmoid scaling to *smooth* fit scores, balancing exploration/exploitation. **Crucially:** Prioritize bin fullness (absolute capacity!), avoid zero-capacity/division issues, and prevent early bin saturation. Dynamic parameter adjustment helps.
