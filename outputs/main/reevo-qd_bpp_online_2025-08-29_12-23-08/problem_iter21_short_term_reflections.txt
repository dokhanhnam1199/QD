Focus on valid bins, finer granularity in fit prioritization, and controlled exploration via randomness.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, avoid fragmentation, and encourage bin utilization—balance competing objectives.




Prioritize exact fits & minimize waste; consider bin fullness *and* remaining space strategically.
Prioritize minimizing waste, not just maximizing fill—consider item interaction & bin utilization.
Prioritize valid bins, scale scores (sigmoid), favor fullness, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.
Prioritize waste minimization, avoid fragmentation, and encourage partially filled bin usage—small bonuses help!
Prioritize fit *smoothly*, consider bin fullness, and reward larger remaining capacities—avoid harsh penalties.
Prioritize waste minimization, explore occasionally, and consider item-bin size ratios for improved packing.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize remaining space, and penalize both full & wasteful bins—smoothly.




Focus on feasibility, waste minimization, bin fullness, and occasional exploration for robust online BPP heuristics.
