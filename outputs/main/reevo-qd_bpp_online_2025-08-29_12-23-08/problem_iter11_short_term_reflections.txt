Prioritize fit, avoid zero-division, and dynamically scale scores based on item size & bin fullness.
Prioritize nuanced waste evaluation, combine weighted criteria, and penalize near-full bins aggressively.
Prioritize feasibility, simplicity, and reward minimizing remaining space—avoid complex, weighted penalties initially.




Prioritize exact fits & full bins; avoid leaving excessive wasted space—key to better packing!




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and explore with occasional randomness—balance exploitation & exploration.
Prioritize fit *and* fullness; sigmoid scaling & filtering invalid bins significantly improves performance.
Favor exploiting bin tightness—smaller remaining space yields higher priority—and avoid zero-division issues.
Prioritize simplicity & exploit problem specifics (exact fit!). Avoid complex scaling if unnecessary.
Prioritize simplicity & strong, targeted rules (exact fit first) over complex scoring. Avoid penalizing unnecessarily.




Prioritize strongly (high value), penalize fragmentation, and consider bin fullness—avoiding both extremes.
