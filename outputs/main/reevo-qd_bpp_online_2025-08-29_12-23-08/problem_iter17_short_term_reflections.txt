Prioritize exact fits, then best fits; consider a weighted combination of fit quality & bin utilization.




Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize waste, and explore via randomness—simplicity & targeted rewards often win.




Combine simple, dominating rules with continuous measures (like tightness) for robust, adaptive bin packing heuristics.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, avoid fragmentation, and favor partially filled, non-empty bins.
Focus on smooth, normalized scoring; avoid hard thresholds & prioritize fractional bin filling.
Prioritize exact fits, manage bin fullness, and avoid nearly-empty bins; tune sigmoid scaling carefully.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and explore with controlled randomness—balance exploitation & exploration.
Prioritize smooth scoring (sigmoid), consider bin fullness, and reward exact fits heavily.
Focus on feasibility first, then prioritize minimizing waste within valid bins—simplicity often wins.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Simplicity often beats complex scoring functions in online problems.
