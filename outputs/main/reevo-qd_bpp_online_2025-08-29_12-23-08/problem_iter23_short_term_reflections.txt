Prioritize waste minimization, explore randomness, and consider item-bin size ratios for improved bin packing.




Combine fit, utilization, and fullness penalties; prioritize empty/near-empty bins—avoid overly full ones.
Prioritize fit *and* utilization; smoothly penalize fullness—avoiding hard cutoffs improves performance.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize fragmentation, and avoid division by zero—simplicity & stability matter!
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Simplicity & directness often outperform complex, dynamic adjustments.
Prioritize smooth, scaled fitness & consider bin fullness—avoid extremes—for robust online packing.
Prioritize fit, penalize fullness, and introduce controlled exploration for robust online bin packing.
Prioritize minimizing waste, but balance exploitation with occasional, small exploration for robustness.
Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize waste, and explore via randomness—balance exploitation & exploration!
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste; consider bin density & item order.
