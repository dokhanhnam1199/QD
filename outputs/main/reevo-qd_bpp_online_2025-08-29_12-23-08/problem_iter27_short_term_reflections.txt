Prioritize exact fits, balance fullness, and gently reward larger remaining capacities—avoid overly aggressive scaling.




Non-linear scoring (sigmoid) & filtering invalid bins dramatically improves bin packing heuristic performance.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize wasted space, & consider bin fullness—density matters!
Prioritize smooth, scaled fitness scores (sigmoid) & avoid complex, hand-tuned weights. Simplicity often wins!




Prioritize exact fits, then tightest/almost-full bins; simplicity & directness often outperform complex weighting.
Prioritize minimizing waste *and* considering bin utilization/fullness—don't just rely on randomness.
Focus on exact fits, minimal remaining capacity, and bin density—simplicity & exploitation matter.
Prioritize exact fits, smoothness, and avoid nearly-full bins; combine multiple scoring factors.




Focus on fit difference, smoothness, and tunable tightness—avoiding both extremes effectively.
Prioritize exact fits, waste minimization (sigmoid scaling), & partially filled bins; add controlled exploration.
