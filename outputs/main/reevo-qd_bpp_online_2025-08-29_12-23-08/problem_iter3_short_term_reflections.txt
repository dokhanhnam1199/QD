Consider fit *and* bin fullness; sigmoid scaling balances exploration/exploitation effectively. Avoid zero-capacity bins.




Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Avoid assigning low priority to feasible bins.
Prioritize minimizing waste, consider bin fullness, and avoid zero divisions—like the better code does.
Prioritize exact fits; consider remaining space—smaller differences often yield better packing density.
Exploit bin fit (remaining space) & avoid zero-division; randomness isn't always improvement.
Prioritize nuanced fit *and* bin distribution—avoid early saturation via penalties/shaping.
Prioritize tighter fits, avoid division by zero, and consider bin fullness—not just ratios.
Combine exploitation (best fit) with exploration (randomness); consider item-specific exploration rates.
Prioritize exact fits & smooth fit scores; consider bin fullness & adjust parameters dynamically.




Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Sigmoids can help, but direct capacity consideration is key.
