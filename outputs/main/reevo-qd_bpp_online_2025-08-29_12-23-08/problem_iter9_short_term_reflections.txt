Simplicity often wins! Focus on core fit, avoid unnecessary filtering/complexity. Consider item-specific adjustments.




Embrace exploration (epsilon-greedy)! Combine greedy approaches with randomness for robust, adaptive bin packing.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and avoid nearly-full bins; combine multiple scoring signals effectively.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and avoid fragmentation—balance fullness for better packing.
Prioritize exploitation (best fit) but occasionally explore with randomness—balance greediness & diversity.
Prioritize simplicity & exploit problem specifics (exact fit!). Avoid complex scaling unless demonstrably beneficial.
Prioritize waste minimization & fullness; avoid complex weighting/penalties; simplicity often wins.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and subtly penalize nearly-full bins for improved packing.
Simplicity & avoiding complex weighting often wins; prioritize remaining space directly.
Embrace simplicity & exploration; balance exploitation (best fit) with randomness (epsilon-greedy) for robustness.
