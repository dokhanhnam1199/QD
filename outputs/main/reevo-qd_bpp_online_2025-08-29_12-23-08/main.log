Your task is to write a priority function using the Inverse Distance (Proximity Fit) strategy for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Worst Fit.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(valid_bins):
        return priorities  # No bin can accommodate the item

    priorities[valid_bins] = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]
    return priorities

[Better code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    """
    # Avoid division by zero and negative capacities
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0
    bins_remain_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]

    # Calculate the fit ratio: item size / remaining capacity
    fit_ratios = item / bins_remain_cap_valid
    
    # Use a sigmoid function to map the fit ratio to a priority score.
    # The sigmoid function maps values to the range (0, 1), with lower fit ratios (better fit)
    # resulting in higher scores.
    # We use a scaling factor (e.g., 10) to control the steepness of the sigmoid.
    priorities_valid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(10 * (fit_ratios - 0.5))) 

    # Create an array of priorities with the same size as bins_remain_cap
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities[valid_bins] = priorities_valid
    
    return priorities

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Worse code]
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

    Return:

    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Worst Fit.

    Return:

    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(valid_bins):
        return priorities  # No bin can accommodate the item

    priorities[valid_bins] = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]
    return priorities

[Better code]

    # Calculate the fit ratio: item size / remaining capacity
    fit_ratios = item / bins_remain_cap_valid
    
    # Use a sigmoid function to map the fit ratio to a priority score.
    # The sigmoid function maps values to the range (0, 1), with lower fit ratios (better fit)
    # resulting in higher scores.
    # We use a scaling factor (e.g., 10) to control the steepness of the sigmoid.
    priorities_valid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(10 * (fit_ratios - 0.5))) 

    # Create an array of priorities with the same size as bins_remain_cap
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities[valid_bins] = priorities_valid
    
    return priorities

[Reflection]
Consider fit *and* bin fullness; sigmoid scaling balances exploration/exploitation effectively. Avoid zero-capacity bins.





[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Consider fit *and* bin fullness; sigmoid scaling balances exploration/exploitation effectively. Avoid zero-capacity bins.




Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Avoid assigning low priority to feasible bins.
Prioritize minimizing waste, consider bin fullness, and avoid zero divisions—like the better code does.
Prioritize exact fits; consider remaining space—smaller differences often yield better packing density.
Exploit bin fit (remaining space) & avoid zero-division; randomness isn't always improvement.
Prioritize nuanced fit *and* bin distribution—avoid early saturation via penalties/shaping.
Prioritize tighter fits, avoid division by zero, and consider bin fullness—not just ratios.
Combine exploitation (best fit) with exploration (randomness); consider item-specific exploration rates.
Prioritize exact fits & smooth fit scores; consider bin fullness & adjust parameters dynamically.




Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Sigmoids can help, but direct capacity consideration is key.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:

**Focus:** Exact fits & minimal waste are paramount. Use sigmoid scaling to *smooth* fit scores, balancing exploration/exploitation. **Crucially:** Prioritize bin fullness (absolute capacity!), avoid zero-capacity/division issues, and prevent early bin saturation. Dynamic parameter adjustment helps.





[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Fit Score.

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
