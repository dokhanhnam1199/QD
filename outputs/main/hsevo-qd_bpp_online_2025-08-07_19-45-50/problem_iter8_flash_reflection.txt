**Analysis:**  
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that heuristic 1 provides a complete, numerically‑stable softmax with epsilon‑greedy exploration and explicit handling of infeasible bins, while heuristic 20 is incomplete – it only defines a random branch, lacks a deterministic return, misuses `-inf`, and can return `None`.  
Comparing (second best) vs (second worst), we see heuristic 2 implements a robust softmax over feasible bins and correctly returns zeros for infeasibility, whereas heuristic 19 suffers the same omission as 20: no deterministic branch and a missing return, making it non‑functional.  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both use softmax of negative waste; heuristic 1 includes a default `ε=0.1` and computes scores for all bins with `-inf` for infeasible ones, while heuristic 2 isolates the feasible subset, defaults `ε=0. 0` and uses a sharper `τ=0.5`, yielding a leaner implementation but fewer features.  
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic 3 simply returns linear negative waste (no normalization), whereas heuristic 4 applies a sigmoid to the fill‑ratio (`k=12`), providing a non‑linear ranking but still no probability distribution; both ignore exploration and temperature.  
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), heuristics 19 and 20 are identical copies with the same bug: they only handle the ε‑branch and omit a return for the normal softmax case, so they are equally broken.  
Overall, the top heuristics prioritize numerical stability, clear infeasibility handling, optional exploration, and return a proper probability distribution; mid‑tier heuristics vary in sophistication but often lack normalization; the bottom heuristics contain critical logical gaps and are unusable.  

**Experience:**  
Use a stable softmax, explicit infeasibility handling, optional ε‑exploration, and always return a well‑defined distribution; keep code concise, avoid duplication, and document defaults clearly.
