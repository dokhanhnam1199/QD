{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nBuild heuristics with type\u2011safe, RNG\u2011flexible, stable softmax, and explicit epsilon handling; avoid duplicated logic, document all parameters clearly, and ensure every branch returns a valid probability distribution, especially when no feasible bins remain.\nSoftmax with numerical stability consistently outperforms raw or epsilon\u2011greedy scores. Explicit masking, early return for infeasible bins, and proper normalization are critical. Avoid raw `-inf` scores that break comparisons. Provide clear docstrings and control randomness. These practices yield robust, exploration\u2011friendly heuristics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics that are deterministic, succinct, well\u2011documented, and fully vectorized; avoid unnecessary softmax or stochastic elements unless explicitly required.\n\nUse a stable softmax, explicit infeasibility handling, optional \u03b5\u2011exploration, and always return a well\u2011defined distribution; keep code concise, avoid duplication, and document defaults clearly.\n\nTo craft a reliable priority heuristic, always provide descriptive docstrings, type hints, and handle infeasible bins explicitly. Use vectorized NumPy operations, normalize probabilities, and include optional epsilon\u2011greedy exploration. Avoid undefined names and ensure RNG initialization; test edge cases before deployment.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
