**Analysis:**
- Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see **H1** uses a stable, temperature‑scaled softmax with clean ε‑exploration and returns a proper probability vector, whereas **H20** mixes logistic transformation and ε‑blending before softmax, adding unnecessary complexity and potential numerical instability.  
- (second best) vs (second worst), **H2** implements a tidy softmax with optional ε‑exploration and returns normalized probabilities, while **H19** (duplicate of H15) lacks a fallback for exploitation and yields zeros when ε=0, making it unusable.  
- Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), **H1** directly masks infeasible bins with ‑inf and computes raw scores in a single expression, whereas **H2** builds a separate scores array and duplicates logic, resulting in slightly more verbose code and a minor performance hit.  
- (3rd) vs (4th), **H3** applies a sigmoid on the slack ratio, producing bounded but non‑probability priorities and no exploration; **H4** returns negative waste priorities with optional ε‑exploration but uses ‑inf for infeasible bins and does not normalize to a probability distribution, complicating downstream decisions.  
- Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), **H19** returns zeros or improper scores due to a missing exploitation branch, whereas **H20** produces a valid probability distribution but still contains unnecessary logistic blending and may suffer from exponentiation of large combined values.  
- Overall: The top heuristics share consistent infeasible‑bin handling, stable temperature‑scaled softmax, optional ε‑exploration, and clear probability outputs. The bottom ones suffer from incomplete logic, non‑probability outputs, or redundant complexity.

**Experience:**
For a robust priority function, ensure infeasible bins are masked, use a stable temperature‑scaled softmax to produce a probability distribution, add a clean ε‑exploration branch, avoid returning ‑inf or zeros for infeasible bins, and keep the implementation concise and well‑documented.
