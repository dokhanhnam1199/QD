**Analysis:**  
- **Comparing (best) vs (worst):** The best heuristic (1st) uses a numerically stable softmax, normalizes across all feasible bins, and returns zeros for infeasible cases. Its docstring accurately describes this behavior. The worst heuristic (20th) simply returns raw negative waste or random scores with `-inf` for infeasible bins; it lacks normalization, offers no probability distribution, and its docstring misleads by claiming epsilon‑greedy exploration that is inconsistently applied. This omission leads to biased and unstable bin choices.  
- **(second best) vs (second worst):** The second best (2nd) introduces a temperature parameter (`tau`) but otherwise follows the softmax pattern, providing a tunable exploration factor and a robust, normalized priority vector. The second worst (19th) reproduces the epsilon‑greedy design without any softmax, returning `-inf` for infeasible bins and random scores for exploration. The temperature‑scaled softmax is more principled and offers better control over exploration than raw or random scoring.  
- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Both implement softmax; the 2nd adds explicit temperature scaling, whereas the 1st’s implementation is slightly simpler and zeroes infeasible bins early. Functionally they are similar, but the 2nd’s `tau` parameter allows fine‑tuning of exploration.  
- **(3rd) vs (4th):** These are identical implementations: they use an explicit mask, set infeasible scores to `-inf`, compute a stable softmax, and return a proper probability distribution. No difference in quality.  
- **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst):** 18th and 20th are the same epsilon‑greedy design, neither normalizes nor applies softmax. They treat infeasible bins with `-inf` and occasionally return random scores, leading to equivalent but inferior performance compared to the softmax‑based heuristics.  
- **Overall:** The top heuristics excel by ensuring numerical stability, proper softmax normalization, and early handling of infeasible bins. Lower‑ranked heuristics fail to do so, either by omitting softmax, returning `-inf` scores directly, or relying on unnormalised random exploration, which results in inconsistent or biased placement decisions.

**Experience:**  
Softmax with numerical stability consistently outperforms raw or epsilon‑greedy scores. Explicit masking, early return for infeasible bins, and proper normalization are critical. Avoid raw `-inf` scores that break comparisons. Provide clear docstrings and control randomness. These practices yield robust, exploration‑friendly heuristics.
