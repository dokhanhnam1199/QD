Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Temperature-scaled softmax with optional epsilon-greedy exploration; returns normalized priorities for feasible bins.\"\"\"\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    if rng is None:\n        rng = np.random.default_rng()\n    if rng.random() < epsilon:\n        probs = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n        probs[feasible] = 1.0 / np.count_nonzero(feasible)\n        return probs\n    residual = bins_remain_cap.astype(float) - item\n    raw_scores = -residual / tau\n    raw_scores[~feasible] = -np.inf\n    max_score = np.max(raw_scores)\n    exp_scores = np.exp(raw_scores - max_score)\n    sum_exp = np.sum(exp_scores)\n    return exp_scores / sum_exp if sum_exp > 0 else np.zeros_like(exp_scores)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords**: Softmax, epsilon\u2011greedy; **Advice**: Use stable softmax with epsilon\u2011greedy; **Avoid**: raw scores or deterministic only; **Explanation**: Gives smooth, exploratory probabilities.  \n- **Keywords**: Infeasibility masking; **Advice**: Mask infeasible bins before normalization; **Avoid**: implicit -inf or NaN; **Explanation**: Guarantees valid selections and stable sums.  \n- **Keywords**: RNG seed control; **Advice**: Pass a seed to a local RNG and use it for all randomness; **Avoid**: global unseeded RNG; **Explanation**: Enables reproducibility and debugging.  \n- **Keywords**: Docs & tests; **Advice**: Write full docstrings, type hints, and unit tests for edge cases; **Avoid**: minimal comments or unchecked inputs; **Explanation**: Improves maintainability and catches hidden bugs.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
