{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nKeep heuristics simple, use temperature\u2011scaled softmax with stable exponent tricks, and add controlled \u03b5\u2011greedy or Gumbel noise\u2014avoid excess hyper\u2011parameters, magic constants, and unnecessary rank or penalty layers. Simplicity yields interpretability and reliable performance.\nSoftmax with numerical stability consistently outperforms raw or epsilon\u2011greedy scores. Explicit masking, early return for infeasible bins, and proper normalization are critical. Avoid raw `-inf` scores that break comparisons. Provide clear docstrings and control randomness. These practices yield robust, exploration\u2011friendly heuristics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics that are deterministic, succinct, well\u2011documented, and fully vectorized; avoid unnecessary softmax or stochastic elements unless explicitly required.\n\nUse a stable softmax, explicit infeasibility handling, optional \u03b5\u2011exploration, and always return a well\u2011defined distribution; keep code concise, avoid duplication, and document defaults clearly.\n\nTo craft a reliable priority heuristic, always provide descriptive docstrings, type hints, and handle infeasible bins explicitly. Use vectorized NumPy operations, normalize probabilities, and include optional epsilon\u2011greedy exploration. Avoid undefined names and ensure RNG initialization; test edge cases before deployment.\n\nBuild heuristics with type\u2011safe, RNG\u2011flexible, stable softmax, and explicit epsilon handling; avoid duplicated logic, document all parameters clearly, and ensure every branch returns a valid probability distribution, especially when no feasible bins remain.\n\nFor a robust priority function, ensure infeasible bins are masked, use a stable temperature\u2011scaled softmax to produce a probability distribution, add a clean \u03b5\u2011exploration branch, avoid returning \u2011inf or zeros for infeasible bins, and keep the implementation concise and well\u2011documented.\n\nUse simple waste\u2011based scores, clear feasibility masking, and optional \u03b5\u2011greedy with reproducible RNG. Add temperature or softmax only when probabilistic sampling is required. Ensure numeric stability via max\u2011shift, avoid over\u2011complex transformations, and keep docstrings explicit for maintainability.\n\nPrioritise clear docstrings, early feasibility checks, stable softmax via log\u2011sum\u2011exp, explicit \u03b5\u2011greedy with RNG injection, and always return normalized probabilities; avoid ad\u2011hoc constants, unnormalised scores, and duplicated code.
