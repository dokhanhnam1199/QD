- **Keywords**: Dynamic weighting, ensemble, feedback‑driven, meta‑learning.  
- **Advice**: Combine multiple scoring functions into an ensemble, continuously update each component’s influence from observed outcomes, and let a meta‑learner propose parameter tweaks when performance deviates from expectations.  
- **Avoid**: Fixed thresholds, static weight assignments, hand‑crafted parameters that never change, and isolated heuristics lacking self‑tuning.  
- **Explanation**: Dynamic ensembles keep the search diverse, feedback refines component relevance, meta‑learning automates tuning, while static designs quickly become brittle across varied problem instances.
