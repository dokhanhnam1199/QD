- **Keywords:** numerical stability, infeasibility masking, ε‑greedy, temperature scaling, softmax, RNG control, clear docs, vectorized.  
- **Advice:** design with optional stochasticity, stable softmax, early infeasibility mask, normalize probabilities, provide type hints, enable RNG injection, document defaults.  
- **Avoid:** deterministic hardcoding, unnecessary softmax when not sampling, duplicate logic, undefined names, uninitialized RNG, over‑complex transformations, magic constants.  
- **Explanation:** These practices ensure robust, exploration‑friendly heuristics that remain numerically stable and easy to maintain.
