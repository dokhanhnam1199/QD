**Advice:** Build a predictive model to rank items from features; use dynamic thresholds that shift with recent outcomes; cluster similar items to reduce complexity; employ feedback loops to tune scores; weight options with contextual signals; favor rank‑based adjustments over chance‑based weighting.  

**Avoid:** Fixed ranking rules; static thresholds; ignoring context; duplicate evaluations; opaque heuristics; simplistic score tweaks; disregarding noisy inputs.  

**Explanation:** Adaptive, data‑driven, feedback‑rich methods deliver robust, responsive heuristics without unstable random weighting.
