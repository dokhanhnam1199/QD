Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Softmax-Based Fit priority: tighter fits receive higher scores.\"\"\"\n    \\\n    residual = bins_remain_cap - item\n    mask = residual >= 0\n    if not np.any(mask):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    scores = -residual\n    scores[~mask] = -np.inf\n    max_score = scores[mask].max()\n    exp_scores = np.exp(scores - max_score)\n    exp_scores[~mask] = 0.0\n    total = exp_scores.sum()\n    if total == 0:\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    return exp_scores / total\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Exact-fit-first priority with optional epsilon-greedy exploration.\"\"\"\n    # Feasibility mask and deterministic priority (negative waste)\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    deterministic = np.where(feasible, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)\n    # With probability epsilon, use random scores for feasible bins\n    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:\n        random_scores = np.random.rand(bins := bins_remain_cap.shape[0])\n        return np.where(feasible, random_scores, -np.inf)\n    return deterministic\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that heuristic\u202f1 provides a complete, numerically\u2011stable softmax with epsilon\u2011greedy exploration and explicit handling of infeasible bins, while heuristic\u202f20 is incomplete \u2013 it only defines a random branch, lacks a deterministic return, misuses `-inf`, and can return `None`.  \nComparing (second best) vs (second worst), we see heuristic\u202f2 implements a robust softmax over feasible bins and correctly returns zeros for infeasibility, whereas heuristic\u202f19 suffers the same omission as 20: no deterministic branch and a missing return, making it non\u2011functional.  \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), both use softmax of negative waste; heuristic\u202f1 includes a default `\u03b5=0.1` and computes scores for all bins with `-inf` for infeasible ones, while heuristic\u202f2 isolates the feasible subset, defaults `\u03b5=0.\u202f0` and uses a sharper `\u03c4=0.5`, yielding a leaner implementation but fewer features.  \nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic\u202f3 simply returns linear negative waste (no normalization), whereas heuristic\u202f4 applies a sigmoid to the fill\u2011ratio (`k=12`), providing a non\u2011linear ranking but still no probability distribution; both ignore exploration and temperature.  \nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), heuristics\u202f19 and\u202f20 are identical copies with the same bug: they only handle the \u03b5\u2011branch and omit a return for the normal softmax case, so they are equally broken.  \nOverall, the top heuristics prioritize numerical stability, clear infeasibility handling, optional exploration, and return a proper probability distribution; mid\u2011tier heuristics vary in sophistication but often lack normalization; the bottom heuristics contain critical logical gaps and are unusable.\n- \n- **Keywords**: softmax, numerical stability, infeasibility masking, \u03b5\u2011exploration, defined distribution, concise code, documentation  \n- **Advice**: Use a stable softmax, explicitly mask infeasible options, add optional \u03b5\u2011exploration, always return a full probability vector, keep code concise, avoid duplicate logic, and document default parameters.  \n- **Avoid**: deterministic behavior, excessive brevity, full vectorization, needless softmax or stochasticity unless explicitly required.  \n- **Explanation**: Non\u2011determinism preserves exploration; controlled stochasticity improves robustness, while a stable softmax guarantees numerical safety and a usable probability vector.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
