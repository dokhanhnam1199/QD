- **Keywords:** temperature scaling, max‑value subtraction, prune invalid choices, calibrated randomness, minimal hyper‑parameters, reproducibility.  
- **Advice:** use temperature‑scaled scores after subtracting the max; ignore invalid candidates at the start; add calibrated Gumbel perturbations for exploration; expose only knobs, leave other parts unchanged.  
- **Avoid:** hard‑coded magic numbers, layered penalty transforms, redundant branches, hidden randomness, over‑engineered feature combos.  
- **Explanation:** subtracting the max score before exponentiation prevents overflow while preserving relative ordering; ignoring invalid candidates early ensures no probability goes to them; calibrated perturbations give controlled exploration without destabilizing the search; a hyper‑parameter set stays transparent, easy to tune, and reproducible with seeded RNG.
