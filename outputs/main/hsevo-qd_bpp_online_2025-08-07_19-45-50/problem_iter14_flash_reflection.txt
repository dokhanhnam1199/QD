**Analysis:**

- **Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 20th, we see** that the 1st implements a full epsilon‑greedy softmax: it initializes a RNG only when needed, uses a stable exp shift, handles infeasible bins by returning zeros, and documents the behavior clearly. The 20th omits the core scoring branch when ε=0, returns an all‑zero distribution, ignores the τ parameter, and has a terse docstring that fails to warn about the missing logic.

- **Comparing Heuristics 2nd vs 19th, we see** the same pattern: the 2nd duplicates the robust design of the 1st, whereas the 19th repeats the same incomplete logic as the 20th, including the missing normal‑score branch and lack of proper RNG handling.

- **Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 2nd, we see** no difference at all; both are identical copies of the best implementation.

- **Comparing Heuristics 3rd vs 4th, we see** the 3rd is a copy of the 1st, while the 4th substitutes `np.random` for a passed RNG, slightly reduces flexibility, and uses a `temperature` parameter but still performs a stable softmax. The docstring is shorter, and the code mixes parameter names (`tau` vs `temperature`) inconsistently.

- **Comparing Heuristics 18th vs 20th, we see** both share the same flaw: the normal scoring branch is missing; only the random‑exploration path is executed when ε>0. For ε=0 they return a zero vector, leaving the heuristic useless in the common case. The τ parameter is unused, and the implementation can silently produce NaNs if no feasible bins exist.

**Overall:** Robustness hinges on consistent RNG usage, clear epsilon handling, a complete scoring branch, and stable numerical computation. The top heuristics satisfy these; the lowest ones either omit critical logic or expose bugs.

**Experience:** Build heuristics with type‑safe, RNG‑flexible, stable softmax, and explicit epsilon handling; avoid duplicated logic, document all parameters clearly, and ensure every branch returns a valid probability distribution, especially when no feasible bins remain.
