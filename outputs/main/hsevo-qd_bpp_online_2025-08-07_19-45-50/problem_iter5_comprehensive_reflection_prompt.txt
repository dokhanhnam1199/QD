{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nSoftmax with numerical stability consistently outperforms raw or epsilon\u2011greedy scores. Explicit masking, early return for infeasible bins, and proper normalization are critical. Avoid raw `-inf` scores that break comparisons. Provide clear docstrings and control randomness. These practices yield robust, exploration\u2011friendly heuristics.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics that are deterministic, succinct, well\u2011documented, and fully vectorized; avoid unnecessary softmax or stochastic elements unless explicitly required.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
