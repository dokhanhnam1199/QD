**Analysis:**  
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see the best heuristic has a clear docstring, explicit feasibility mask, deterministic `-residual` priorities and safe `-inf` for infeasible bins; the worst adds stochastic `epsilon` exploration, returns random scores, lacks documentation, and introduces nondeterminism.  
(Second best) vs (second worst), the second‑best uses a concise `np.where` to compute the same deterministic priorities, while the second‑worst inherits the same random‑epsilon logic as the worst.  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both produce identical priority vectors; the 1st is more verbose with explicit mask and `np.full`, includes documentation, while the 2nd is a one‑liner but equally clear and efficient.  
(3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd wraps the simple priority in a softmax with scaling (`tau`), exponentials and normalization—unnecessary overhead for a raw priority function—whereas the 4th is the simple deterministic `np,` approach identical to the 2nd.  
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are functionally identical random‑epsilon implementations; the ranking difference is arbitrary, but both share the same drawbacks.  
Overall: the top heuristics prioritize simplicity, deterministic vectorized computation, and proper documentation; mid‑rank duplicates add no value; softmax variants introduce needless complexity; random‑epsilon variants sacrifice reproducibility and performance.

**Experience:**  
Design heuristics that are deterministic, succinct, well‑documented, and fully vectorized; avoid unnecessary softmax or stochastic elements unless explicitly required.
