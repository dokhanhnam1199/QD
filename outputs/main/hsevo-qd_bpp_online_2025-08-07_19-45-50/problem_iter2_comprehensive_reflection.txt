- **Keywords**: deterministic, vectorized, succinct, modular, reproducible.  
- **Advice**: Redefine the self‑reflection to build heuristics that are fully vectorized, modular with clear APIs, succinctly coded, and comprehensively documented and tested.  
- **Avoid**: Implicit randomness (e.g., softmax without purpose), hidden side‑effects, verbose loops, undocumented assumptions.  
- **Explanation**: Determinism and vectorization give speed and reproducibility; succinct, modular code eases maintenance; thorough documentation prevents misuse and supports the design of robust heuristics.
