**Analysis:**  
Comparing the best (heuristic 1) vs the worst (heuristic 20) we see a clean, temperature‑scaled softmax with ε‑greedy uniform exploration, stable exponent handling and concise documentation versus an over‑engineered pipeline that mixes penalties, risk‐adjusted scores, rank weighting, adaptive noise, and many magic constants – far less interpretable and prone to instability.  
Comparing the second best (heuristic 2) vs the second worst (heuristic 19) the former retains a simple deterministic waste‑based softmax and optional random‑softmax mixing, while the latter mirrors the complexity of heuristic 20 (rank‑based adaptive scoring with noise).  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd) we note that heuristic 1 uses a single ε‑greedy branch (uniform random or pure softmax), whereas heuristic 2 always blends deterministic and random softmaxes, adding unnecessary computation and diluting the deterministic signal.  
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) the third returns –∞ for infeasible bins and mixes deterministic/random softmaxes; the fourth enriches exploration with Gumbel perturbation and ε‑uniform mixing, offering more principled stochasticity at modest cost.  
Comparing the second worst (heuristic 19) vs the worst (heuristic 20) reveals they are identical copies – no design difference.  
**Overall:** Simpler softmax‑based designs with clear ε‑greedy control and stable numeric handling consistently outperform heavily parameterised, noisy, or ad‑hoc constructions; clarity, minimalism, and well‑defined exploration are key to robust heuristic performance.  

**Experience:**  
Keep heuristics simple, use temperature‑scaled softmax with stable exponent tricks, and add controlled ε‑greedy or Gumbel noise—avoid excess hyper‑parameters, magic constants, and unnecessary rank or penalty layers. Simplicity yields interpretability and reliable performance.
