- **Keywords:** multi‑objective scoring, adaptive perturbation, penalty‑based feasibility, rank (sic)‑based weighting.  
- **Advice:** blend waste, cost, risk into a composite score; rank scores and assign probabilities decreasing with rank (e.g., power‑law); inject decaying random perturbations; replace binary masks with penalty terms for infeasibility; let scaling adapt from outcomes; modularize components to swap scoring or perturbation.  
- **Avoid:** pure deterministic pipelines, fixed random seeds, hard infeasibility masking, single‑objective focus, static probability scaling, excessive reliance on terse code, heavy documentation or type annotation.  
- **Explanation:** these principles create a flexible, stable heuristic that explores broadly and adapts to problem specifics, without rigid coding or deterministic limits.
