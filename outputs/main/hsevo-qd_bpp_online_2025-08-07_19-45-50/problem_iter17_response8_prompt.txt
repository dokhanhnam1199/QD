Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Softmax of negative slack with temperature and optional epsilon\u2011greedy exploration.\"\"\"\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    if np.any(feasible):\n        slack = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n        idx = np.nonzero(feasible)[0]\n        priorities[idx] = -slack\n        exact_idx = idx[slack == 0]\n        priorities[exact_idx] = 1e12\n        if tau > 0:\n            priorities[idx] = priorities[idx] / tau\n        if epsilon > 0 and np.random.rand() < epsilon:\n            priorities[idx] = np.random.rand(len(idx))\n        else:\n            max_val = np.max(priorities[idx])\n            exp_vals = np.exp(priorities[idx] - max_val)\n            probs = exp_vals / np.sum(exp_vals)\n            priorities[idx] = probs\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n_EPSILON = 0.05\n_TEMPERATURE = 0.1\n_RNG = np.random.default_rng()\n\n    \"\"\"Softmax priority with epsilon\u2011greedy exploration, stable and masked.\"\"\"\n    bins_remain_cap = np.asarray(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    if _RNG.random() < _EPSILON:\n        probs = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n        probs[feasible] = 1.0 / feasible.sum()\n        return probs\n    residual = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    temperature = max(_TEMPERATURE, 1e-12)\n    logits = -residual / temperature\n    max_logit = np.max(logits)\n    exp_shifted = np.exp(logits - max_logit)\n    softmax = exp_shifted / np.sum(exp_shifted)\n    scores = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    scores[feasible] = softmax\n    return scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- - Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see **H1** uses a stable, temperature\u2011scaled softmax with clean \u03b5\u2011exploration and returns a proper probability vector, whereas **H20** mixes logistic transformation and \u03b5\u2011blending before softmax, adding unnecessary complexity and potential numerical instability.  \n- (second best) vs (second worst), **H2** implements a tidy softmax with optional \u03b5\u2011exploration and returns normalized probabilities, while **H19** (duplicate of H15) lacks a fallback for exploitation and yields zeros when \u03b5=0, making it unusable.  \n- Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), **H1** directly masks infeasible bins with \u2011inf and computes raw scores in a single expression, whereas **H2** builds a separate scores array and duplicates logic, resulting in slightly more verbose code and a minor performance hit.  \n- (3rd) vs (4th), **H3** applies a sigmoid on the slack ratio, producing bounded but non\u2011probability priorities and no exploration; **H4** returns negative waste priorities with optional \u03b5\u2011exploration but uses \u2011inf for infeasible bins and does not normalize to a probability distribution, complicating downstream decisions.  \n- Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), **H19** returns zeros or improper scores due to a missing exploitation branch, whereas **H20** produces a valid probability distribution but still contains unnecessary logistic blending and may suffer from exponentiation of large combined values.  \n- Overall: The top heuristics share consistent infeasible\u2011bin handling, stable temperature\u2011scaled softmax, optional \u03b5\u2011exploration, and clear probability outputs. The bottom ones suffer from incomplete logic, non\u2011probability outputs, or redundant complexity.\n- \n**Keywords:** Adaptive ranking, Contextual scoring, Learning\u2011based priority, Dynamic thresholds, Clustered selection, Feedback loops, Batch optimization, Hybrid heuristics, Resilience.  \n\n**Advice:** Build a predictive model to rank items from features; use dynamic thresholds that shift with recent outcomes; cluster similar items to reduce complexity; employ feedback loops to tune scores; weight options with contextual signals; favor rank\u2011based adjustments over chance\u2011based weighting.  \n\n**Avoid:** Fixed ranking rules; static thresholds; ignoring context; duplicate evaluations; opaque heuristics; simplistic score tweaks; disregarding noisy inputs.  \n\n**Explanation:** Adaptive, data\u2011driven, feedback\u2011rich methods deliver robust, responsive heuristics without unstable random weighting.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
