**Analysis:**

- **Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see** that the best heuristic (Heuristics 1) follows a clean design: clear docstring, proper feasibility mask, lazy RNG initialization, ε‑greedy fallback, temperature‑scaled stable softmax, and a guaranteed probability vector. The worst heuristic (Heuristics 20) overloads the function with rank weighting, penalty, risk, and Gaussian noise, yet it *fails to exclude infeasible bins* (they receive positive scores) and mixes many hyper‑parameters that make the method brittle and prone to selecting impossible placements.

- **(Second best) vs (second worst), we see** that the second‑best (Heuristics 2) is a minimalist, deterministic softmax on negative waste with numeric stability and correct handling of infeasibility. The second‑worst (Heuristics 19) repeats the same flawed pattern as the worst: it assigns high scores to infeasible bins, adds unnecessary rank and noise terms, and provides no guarantee that the returned vector respects feasibility.

- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see** that the top heuristic adds optional ε‑greedy exploration and a temperature parameter, giving a controllable trade‑off between exploitation and exploration. The second heuristic is deterministic and lacks these knobs, making it less flexible but still correct and stable.

- **(3rd) vs (4th), we see** both aim to combine ε‑greedy and temperature‑scaled softmax. The third implementation (Heuristics 3) correctly lazily creates a `Generator`, uses stable softmax, and normalizes probabilities. The fourth (Heuristics 4) contains a critical bug: it sets `rng = 0` as a placeholder and never re‑initializes it, causing a runtime error when `rng.random()` is called.

- **Comparing (second worst‑case) vs (worst), we see** that Heuristics 19 and 20 are practically identical in logic and suffer the same feasibility‑mask omission, excessive parameterisation, and noisy scoring. The only difference is a slightly different signature; both produce unreliable priorities.

- **Overall:** Simplicity, correct feasibility handling, numerical stability (max‑subtraction before exponentiation), and optional but well‑implemented exploration (ε‑greedy, temperature) consistently separate the higher‑ranked heuristics from the lower ones. Over‑engineering with ranks, penalties, or noise without rigorous masking introduces bugs and degrades performance.

**Experience:**  
Design heuristics that are simple, numerically stable, and explicitly mask infeasible options. Add optional ε‑greedy exploration and temperature scaling for flexibility, and keep extra features (rank, noise, penalties) only when they are well‑justified and correctly gated. Clear docstrings and lazy RNG init further improve robustness.
