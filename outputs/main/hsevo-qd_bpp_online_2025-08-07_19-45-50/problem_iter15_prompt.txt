Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Temperature-scaled softmax with optional epsilon-greedy exploration; returns normalized priorities for feasible bins.\"\"\"\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    if rng is None:\n        rng = np.random.default_rng()\n    if rng.random() < epsilon:\n        probs = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n        probs[feasible] = 1.0 / np.count_nonzero(feasible)\n        return probs\n    residual = bins_remain_cap.astype(float) - item\n    raw_scores = -residual / tau\n    raw_scores[~feasible] = -np.inf\n    max_score = np.max(raw_scores)\n    exp_scores = np.exp(raw_scores - max_score)\n    sum_exp = np.sum(exp_scores)\n    return exp_scores / sum_exp if sum_exp > 0 else np.zeros_like(exp_scores)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** type safety, RNG flexibility, stable softmax, explicit\u202f\u03b5, infeasibility mask, full distribution, thorough docs  \n- **Advice:** inject a seeded RNG, compute softmax via log\u2011sum\u2011exp, add\u202f\u03b5 to scores, mask infeasible bins before normalizing, guarantee every branch returns a normalized probability vector, annotate types and docstrings  \n- **Avoid:** deterministic\u2011only heuristics, skipping softmax, optional\u202f\u03b5, missing docs, absent type hints, raw\u202f\u2011inf scores, duplicated logic, branches that drop probability mass, ambiguous RNG  \n- **Explanation:** these practices ensure numerical stability, reproducible stochastic exploration, safe handling of infeasible choices, and maintainable code that always yields a valid probability distribution.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
