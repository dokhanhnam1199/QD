**Analysis:**  
- **(best) #1 vs (worst) #20:** #1 uses a single deterministic score (‑waste) with an optional ε‑greedy random fallback, returning raw priorities and ‑∞ for infeasible bins. The docstring is concise. #20 layers a logistic best‑fit transform, mixes random scores, applies a stable softmax, and returns probabilities. Its complexity, extra hyper‑parameters (k, τ), and heavier numerical work make it slower and harder to reason about.  
- **(second‑best) #2 vs (second‑worst) #19:** #2 offers temperature‑scaled softmax over (‑waste), a clear ε‑weighted mixture of deterministic and random components, and robust handling of empty feasible sets. #19 uses ε only as a hard switch between random logits and deterministic softmax, lacking the smooth blending of #2 and providing less control over exploration‑exploitation balance.  
- **#1 vs #2 (1st vs 2nd):** #1 returns raw scores, ideal for greedy selection; #2 returns a probability distribution, enabling stochastic sampling. #2 adds temperature for tunable “softness” and mixes ε in a weighted fashion, but incurs extra computation. Both mask infeasible bins correctly; #2 includes a stable softmax (max‑shift) for numeric safety.  
- **#3 vs #4 (3rd vs 4th):** #3 mirrors #1 with a seed‑based RNG and simple ε‑greedy random scores. #4 introduces a logistic slack‑ratio score and blends it with random scores before a softmax, aiming for a more nuanced fit. The logistic transformation adds non‑linearity that can help in tight packing but also raises complexity and parameter sensitivity (k).  
- **#19 vs #20 (second‑worst vs worst):** Both return probabilities via softmax, but #19’s random branch is a pure softmax of random logits, whereas #20 mixes deterministic logistic scores with random scores before softmax. #20’s extra logistic layer and higher‑k sigmoid can cause overly aggressive bias toward near‑full bins, reducing robustness. #19 remains marginally simpler.  

**Overall:** Simpler deterministic waste‑based scoring with optional ε‑greedy randomness (as in #1) provides clarity, speed, and easy reproducibility. When probabilistic selection is needed, a temperature‑scaled softmax with weighted ε‑mixing (#2) offers controlled exploration without unnecessary logistic transforms.

**Experience:** Use simple waste‑based scores, clear feasibility masking, and optional ε‑greedy with reproducible RNG. Add temperature or softmax only when probabilistic sampling is required. Ensure numeric stability via max‑shift, avoid over‑complex transformations, and keep docstrings explicit for maintainability.
