Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritize bins: -waste for feasible bins, -inf otherwise; with \u03b5 chance assign random scores.\"\"\"\n    # Vectorized feasibility mask\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\n    # \u03b5\u2011greedy: random scores for feasible bins with probability \u03b5\n    if epsilon > 0.0 and rng.random() < epsilon:\n        random_scores = rng.random(bins_remain_cap.shape)\n        return np.where(feasible, random_scores, -np.inf)\n    # Deterministic waste\u2011minimizing priority\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    return np.where(feasible, -waste, -np.inf)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Best\u2011fit logistic score blended with \u03b5\u2011greedy random exploration via stable softmax.\"\"\"\n    if rng is None:\n        rng = np.random.default_rng()\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not feasible.any():\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    caps = bins_remain_cap.astype(float)\n    space_left = caps - item\n    ratio = np.empty_like(caps, dtype=float)\n    ratio[feasible] = space_left[feasible] / caps[feasible]\n    k = 12.0\n    deterministic = np.empty_like(caps, dtype=float)\n    deterministic[feasible] = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-k * (1.0 - ratio[feasible])))\n    random_scores = np.empty_like(caps, dtype=float)\n    random_scores[feasible] = rng.random(feasible.sum())\n    combined = (1.0 - epsilon) * deterministic + epsilon * random_scores\n    max_combined = combined[feasible].max()\n    exps = np.empty_like(caps, dtype=float)\n    exps[feasible] = np.exp(combined[feasible] - max_combined)\n    sum_exps = exps[feasible].sum()\n    probs = np.full_like(caps, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    probs[feasible] = exps[feasible] / sum_exps\n    return probs\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- - **(best) #1 vs (worst) #20:** #1 uses a single deterministic score (\u2011waste) with an optional \u03b5\u2011greedy random fallback, returning raw priorities and \u2011\u221e for infeasible bins. The docstring is concise. #20 layers a logistic best\u2011fit transform, mixes random scores, applies a stable softmax, and returns probabilities. Its complexity, extra hyper\u2011parameters (k, \u03c4), and heavier numerical work make it slower and harder to reason about.  \n- **(second\u2011best) #2 vs (second\u2011worst) #19:** #2 offers temperature\u2011scaled softmax over (\u2011waste), a clear \u03b5\u2011weighted mixture of deterministic and random components, and robust handling of empty feasible sets. #19 uses \u03b5 only as a hard switch between random logits and deterministic softmax, lacking the smooth blending of #2 and providing less control over exploration\u2011exploitation balance.  \n- **#1 vs #2 (1st vs 2nd):** #1 returns raw scores, ideal for greedy selection; #2 returns a probability distribution, enabling stochastic sampling. #2 adds temperature for tunable \u201csoftness\u201d and mixes \u03b5 in a weighted fashion, but incurs extra computation. Both mask infeasible bins correctly; #2 includes a stable softmax (max\u2011shift) for numeric safety.  \n- **#3 vs #4 (3rd vs 4th):** #3 mirrors #1 with a seed\u2011based RNG and simple \u03b5\u2011greedy random scores. #4 introduces a logistic slack\u2011ratio score and blends it with random scores before a softmax, aiming for a more nuanced fit. The logistic transformation adds non\u2011linearity that can help in tight packing but also raises complexity and parameter sensitivity (k).  \n- **#19 vs #20 (second\u2011worst vs worst):** Both return probabilities via softmax, but #19\u2019s random branch is a pure softmax of random logits, whereas #20 mixes deterministic logistic scores with random scores before softmax. #20\u2019s extra logistic layer and higher\u2011k sigmoid can cause overly aggressive bias toward near\u2011full bins, reducing robustness. #19 remains marginally simpler.  \n\n**Overall:** Simpler deterministic waste\u2011based scoring with optional \u03b5\u2011greedy randomness (as in #1) provides clarity, speed, and easy reproducibility. When probabilistic selection is needed, a temperature\u2011scaled softmax with weighted \u03b5\u2011mixing (#2) offers controlled exploration without unnecessary logistic transforms.\n- \n- **Keywords:** multi\u2011objective scoring, adaptive perturbation, penalty\u2011based feasibility, rank (sic)\u2011based weighting.  \n- **Advice:** blend waste, cost, risk into a composite score; rank scores and assign probabilities decreasing with rank (e.g., power\u2011law); inject decaying random perturbations; replace binary masks with penalty terms for infeasibility; let scaling adapt from outcomes; modularize components to swap scoring or perturbation.  \n- **Avoid:** pure deterministic pipelines, fixed random seeds, hard infeasibility masking, single\u2011objective focus, static probability scaling, excessive reliance on terse code, heavy documentation or type annotation.  \n- **Explanation:** these principles create a flexible, stable heuristic that explores broadly and adapts to problem specifics, without rigid coding or deterministic limits.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
