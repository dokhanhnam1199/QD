**Analysis:**  
- **Best (Heuristic 1) vs Worst (Heuristic 20):** Heuristic 1 has a concise docstring, explicit feasibility mask, early exit, optional RNG injection, ε‑greedy uniform exploration, temperature‑scaled softmax with log‑sum‑exp stability, and returns a proper probability distribution. Heuristic 20 blends waste, rank weighting, and ε‑perturbation but never normalises, lacks log‑sum‑exp, uses ad‑hoc scaling, and returns raw scores, making it numerically unstable and harder to interpret.  
- **Second‑best (Heuristic 2) vs Second‑worst (Heuristic 19):** Both implement the same softmax idea, but Heuristic 2 is clean, has no stray comments, and uses a direct “if rng is None” pattern. Heuristic 19 contains a placeholder comment (`temp  # placeholder to avoid unused variable warning`), duplicated logic from 18, and less‑direct variable naming, slightly reducing readability and hinting at sloppy maintenance.  
- **Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 2:** The source code and docstring are identical; no functional or stylistic difference, confirming the ranking is based on external criteria rather than code quality.  
- **Heuristic 3 vs Heuristic 4:** Again identical implementations, showing redundancy; both share the same docstring and logic, indicating no quality distinction.  
- **Second‑worst (Heuristic 19) vs Worst (Heuristic 20):** Heuristic 19 performs a stable softmax (subtract max, exponentiate, normalise) and respects temperature scaling, while Heuristic 20 applies rank‑based weighting on raw waste, does not apply a softmax nor temperature, and leaves the output unnormalised. The former yields a well‑behaved probability distribution; the latter can produce arbitrary magnitudes and is more sensitive to scale.  
- **Additional illustrative pairs:**  
  - **Heuristic 5 vs Heuristic 6:** Heuristic 5 returns deterministic –waste without normalisation; Heuristic 6 adds a stable softmax with ε‑greedy, producing proper probabilities and smoother exploration.  
  - **Heuristic 7 vs Heuristic 8:** Heuristic 7 uses a hard‑coded huge constant for exact fits; Heuristic 8 blends deterministic waste, random noise, and temperature‑scaled softmax, giving a tunable exploration‑exploitation balance.  
  - **Heuristic 13 vs Heuristic 14:** Heuristic 13 augments negative waste with a logistic fill‑ratio term before softmax, enriching the feature set; Heuristic 14 uses plain softmax on waste only, simpler but potentially less discriminative.  

**Overall:** Top‑ranked heuristics consistently (i) provide clear documentation, (ii) mask infeasible bins early, (iii) employ a numerically stable softmax (log‑sum‑exp), (iv) expose a controllable ε‑greedy exploration with an injectable RNG, and (v) return normalized probability vectors. Lower‑ranked versions omit one or more of these pillars, leading to instability, ambiguous outputs, or harder tuning.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritise clear docstrings, early feasibility checks, stable softmax via log‑sum‑exp, explicit ε‑greedy with RNG injection, and always return normalized probabilities; avoid ad‑hoc constants, unnormalised scores, and duplicated code. (<60 words)
