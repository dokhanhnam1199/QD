Feasibility checks, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, empty bin bonus, and item-size proximity are key.

The better code uses feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation avoidance for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, maximize fill percentage, and avoid fragmentation. Adding bonuses helps.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, fill percentage. Penalize near-full, reward empty bins. Log ratios are less effective.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation avoidance, and empty bin bonuses improve online bin packing.
