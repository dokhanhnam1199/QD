Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control are crucial for effective bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation avoidance are crucial for improved bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control are crucial for effective bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility, best fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control are key to improved bin packing.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control are key improvements over ratio-based prioritization.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, fill percentage, and anti-fragmentation. Consider empty bin bonuses. Avoid direct ratio-based approaches.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control improve bin packing compared to simple ratio-based methods.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, encourage high fill rates, and avoid fragmentation.

The better code uses feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control and empty bin bonus.

Feasibility, best fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation avoidance are key for effective bin packing heuristics.
