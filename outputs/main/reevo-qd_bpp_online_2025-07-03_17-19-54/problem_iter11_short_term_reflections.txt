Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and item size proximity improve bin packing performance.

Feasibility check, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and empty bin bonus improve heuristic performance.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, fill percentage, and item size proximity. Add bonuses for empty bins. Penalize overfilled bins.

Prioritize feasibility. Consider best-fit, fill percentage, and penalize near-full bins to reduce fragmentation.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, promote full bins, and consider fragmentation and empty bin bonuses.

The better code uses feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and empty bin bonus for improved performance.

The better code combines feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and empty bin strategies for improved performance.

Combining feasibility checks, best-fit, fill percentage, and controlled bin closing yields improved packing.

Prioritize feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation avoidance. Also, reward empty bins.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation awareness are crucial for bin packing heuristics.
