Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, promote high fill percentages, and consider fragmentation and empty bins.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, encourage fullness, and avoid fragmentation. Consider empty bin bonuses.

The better code uses feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and empty-bin bonus for improved performance.

The improved code combines feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and empty bin bonus.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and empty bin bonuses improve online bin packing.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and considering empty bins are key improvements.

Feasibility check, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control improve online bin packing heuristics.

The better code uses feasibility checks, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control and empty bin bonus.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and considering empty bins improve performance.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation avoidance are crucial for effective online bin packing heuristics.
