The better code uses feasibility checks, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control and empty bin preference.

The better code incorporates feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and item size proximity for improved bin packing.

Feasibility, best-fit, fragmentation avoidance, fill percentage, and item-size proximity are crucial for bin packing heuristics.

The better code combines feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, and fragmentation control for improved performance.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, empty bin bonus, and item-size proximity are crucial.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation prevention, and empty bin bonus improve heuristic performance.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and empty bin preference are crucial for performance.

The better code incorporates feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and considers empty bins/item size proximity.

Feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation avoidance, and empty bin bonus are key improvements.

The better code uses feasibility, best-fit, fill percentage, fragmentation control, and item size proximity, which the worse code lacks.
