{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nA good heuristic should consider waste minimization, target fill levels, dynamic penalties and bonuses based on item size and bin utilization, adaptive weighting and strategic randomness. Adaptive penalties, bonuses and target fill levels that respond to item size and the overall utilization of bins, significantly improve performance.\nEffective heuristics for bin packing involve balancing several objectives: minimizing waste, targeting fill levels, and preventing overfilling. Incorporating randomness can help escape local optima. Efficient implementations leverage vectorized operations for speed. Tuning the weights of different objectives and thresholds are crucial.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple contributing factors, balance them using weights or adaptive methods, and address potential edge cases with specific penalties or bonuses. Incorporating a degree of randomness can aid in escaping local optima.\n\nPrioritize adaptive weighting based on item characteristics and bin states. Include a combination of waste minimization, target fill consideration, and penalties for undesirable states. Introduce stochasticity for exploration. Fine-tune parameters and weights to achieve optimal performance.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider combining diverse factors with adaptive weighting based on item characteristics and bin states. Also consider introducing randomness and explore penalizing near-full bins, rewarding bins closer to a target fill level, and consider dynamic penalties and bonuses.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics often combine multiple factors like minimizing waste, maximizing utilization, and incorporating randomness. Avoid overly specific rules. Aim for a balance between exploitation (using the best option) and exploration (trying new options) to improve results. Simpler is better.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider adaptive parameters based on problem state (bin utilization, item sizes). Dynamic penalties/bonuses are useful. Decaying randomness encourages exploration early but exploits later. Avoid unnecessary code duplication, as seen in the identical functions with different ranking.\n\nEffective heuristics for bin packing should integrate waste minimization, adaptive weighting that considers item size and bin utilization, and dynamic bin management. Adding a bin diversity reward can encourage exploration. Experiment with different weighting schemes and parameters.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
