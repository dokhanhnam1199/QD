Okay, I'm ready to refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls. Let's aim for that $999K heuristic! Here's my take:

*   **Keywords:** Objective function landscape, adaptive learning, multi-objective optimization, exploration-exploitation balance.

*   **Advice:** Analyze the objective function landscape to inform exploration strategies. Use adaptive learning to dynamically adjust weights and parameters based on feedback during the search. Explicitly define and manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "fine-tuning" or "balancing." Don't rely solely on trial-and-error; base adjustments on observed performance and understanding of the problem structure.

*   **Explanation:** Instead of just saying "tune weights," focus on *how* to tune them. Track performance metrics (e.g., waste, fill level, time) and use these to guide weight adjustments. Adaptive learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) can automate this process. Understanding the objective function landscape helps design more effective exploration strategies (e.g., biased sampling towards promising regions).
