**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates waste minimization, target fill level, near-full penalty, adaptive weighting (based on item size and bin states), bin diversity encouragement, and stochasticity. The worst combines best-fit, target fill, near-full penalty, and randomness, but lacks adaptive weighting, bin diversity, small/large item handling and decaying stochasticity.
(2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical, indicating the ranking is not consistent or is based on factors not apparent in the code alone.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical which suggests the ranking is based on some factors that are not present in the code.
(3rd) vs (4th) are also identical.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst includes Fill percentage bonus, Item Size Consideration while the worst one does not.
Overall: The better heuristics attempt to balance multiple factors by using adaptive weights and considering item sizes, bin diversity, and global bin utilization, while the worse heuristics only focus on a few basic strategies and lack dynamic adjustments.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, consider combining diverse factors with adaptive weighting based on item characteristics and bin states. Also consider introducing randomness and explore penalizing near-full bins, rewarding bins closer to a target fill level, and consider dynamic penalties and bonuses.
