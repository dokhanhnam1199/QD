Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the key difference lies in the stochasticity. Heuristic 3 scales randomness by remaining bin capacity, while Heuristic 4 uses a decaying randomness based on item size. Heuristic 3's approach seems more context-aware. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), no difference either. Comparing (7th) vs (8th), no difference. Comparing (9th) vs (10th) vs (11th) vs (12th), still no difference.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (3rd), Heuristic 1 has more detailed considerations: dynamic near-full management, smaller item bonus, larger item penalty, adaptive weighting considers both item size and bin utilization, and randomness scales with both item size and bin utilization. Heuristic 3 simplifies this to adaptive weighting based on item size and randomness scaled by remaining capacity.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (5th), Heuristic 3 includes stochasticity scaled by remaining capacity, while Heuristic 5 uses decaying randomness based on item size. Also no difference between heuristics 4th and 5th.\n\nComparing (7th) vs (18th), Heuristic 7 uses small item bonus and dynamic bin count penalty, whereas Heuristic 18 uses a near-empty bonus and decaying randomness with item size.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics incorporate more context-aware parameters, such as bin utilization and item size, when calculating weights, penalties, bonuses, and stochasticity. More advanced ones dynamically adjust target fill levels and learning rates. Penalizing \"near-full\" bins and rewarding \"near-empty\" bins seems like a good idea. The decaying randomness is a good pattern.\n- \nOkay, here's a redefinition of \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls, plus the breakdown you requested:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, dynamic penalties/bonuses, stochasticity, problem state.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that adapt to problem state using dynamic weights, penalties/bonuses based on bin and item characteristics. Introduce controlled randomness for exploration.\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, over-complexity, purely deterministic approaches, ignoring problem state information.\n*   **Explanation:** Emphasize adaptability. Heuristics should *react* to the unfolding problem, rather than following fixed rules. Introduce randomness *strategically* to explore better solutions while avoiding local optima.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
