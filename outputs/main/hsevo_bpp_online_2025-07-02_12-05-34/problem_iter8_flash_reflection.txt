**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st implementation uses a penalty for bins becoming nearly full and a randomness factor, while the 20th prioritizes waste minimization, target fill level, and penalizes near-full bins, also adding randomness; (2nd best) vs (second worst) ... the second has a different, possibly more sophisticated, way to balance multiple factors by assigning weights and considering a small item bonus. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one target fill level while the second uses target fill level and gaussian-like score. (3rd) vs (4th) ... we see the 3rd uses tightness, fullness and balance score. the 4th is about wasted space minimization, fill target and randomness. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the 19th has waste minimization, target fill, penalty for near-full, and randomness factors. The 20th has the same factors. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors (waste minimization, target fill, penalties, randomness) and often use weighting or more complex scoring functions to balance these factors. Poorer heuristics may oversimplify or lack specific handling for edge cases (e.g., nearly full bins).

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple contributing factors, balance them using weights or adaptive methods, and address potential edge cases with specific penalties or bonuses. Incorporating a degree of randomness can aid in escaping local optima.
