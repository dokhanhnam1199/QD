**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd has "Anticipatory Near-Full Penalty (Stronger penalty, scaled by item size)" and "Strategic Randomness (Controlled, decays slower for smaller items)", while the 4th does not. The 4th uses item size and bin utilization in adaptive weighting, while the 3rd only uses item size.
Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the worst one uses much more hyperparameter and `scipy`, `random`, `math`, `torch`, which may not be necessary and cause overhead.
Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the 1st has many considerations like waste minimization, target fill level, and near-full management, while the 11th is just the start of the function.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), the 20th enhanced heuristic focuses on a range of target fill levels, using Gaussian penalties for both underfill and overfill, and includes an anticipatory penalty based on average item size and an item fit score. The 19th does not.
Overall: Top heuristics combine waste minimization, target fill level, dynamic penalties (near full, smaller item bonus, larger item penalty), adaptive weighting (item size, utilization), and strategic randomness. The weights are often made adaptive with learning rate to further enhance the performance. High-performing heuristics often include mechanisms to reduce fragmentation, like an anticipatory penalty or an item fit score. Less effective heuristics either lack key components, use simpler calculations, or fail to adapt to item sizes. Over-parameterization also lead to low performance.

**Experience:**
A good heuristic should consider waste minimization, target fill levels, dynamic penalties and bonuses based on item size and bin utilization, adaptive weighting and strategic randomness. Adaptive penalties, bonuses and target fill levels that respond to item size and the overall utilization of bins, significantly improve performance.
