{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple contributing factors, balance them using weights or adaptive methods, and address potential edge cases with specific penalties or bonuses. Incorporating a degree of randomness can aid in escaping local optima.\nEffective heuristics for bin packing involve balancing several objectives: minimizing waste, targeting fill levels, and preventing overfilling. Incorporating randomness can help escape local optima. Efficient implementations leverage vectorized operations for speed. Tuning the weights of different objectives and thresholds are crucial.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics often combine multiple factors like minimizing waste, maximizing utilization, and incorporating randomness. Avoid overly specific rules. Aim for a balance between exploitation (using the best option) and exploration (trying new options) to improve results. Simpler is better.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
