**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st includes a waste minimization component (`tightness = 1 / (waste + 0.0001)`) and adaptive weighting based on item size and bin utilization, whereas the 20th focuses on target fill, near-empty bonus, and decaying randomness.
(2nd best) vs (19th) is almost no different.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), there is almost no difference.
(3rd) vs (4th), there is almost no difference.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there is almost no difference.
Comparing (1st) vs (10th), 1st considers bin utilization in adaptive weighting, 10th does not.
Comparing (14th) vs (15th), there is almost no difference.
Comparing (16th) vs (17th), there is almost no difference.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate waste minimization, adaptive weighting that considers both item size and bin utilization, and dynamic management of near-full bins, while the less effective heuristics rely more on target fill levels and near-empty bonuses without considering bin utilization. Some good heuristics also have bin diversity rewards and a learning rate.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for bin packing should integrate waste minimization, adaptive weighting that considers item size and bin utilization, and dynamic bin management. Adding a bin diversity reward can encourage exploration. Experiment with different weighting schemes and parameters.
