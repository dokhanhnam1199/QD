Okay, I'm ready to help you refine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls. Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, trade-offs, bias mitigation, problem-specific knowledge.
*   **Advice:** Analyze heuristic performance on diverse problem instances. Identify biases. Incorporate feedback mechanisms to adjust parameters and strategies dynamically.
*   **Avoid:** Rigid adherence to pre-defined rules, neglecting problem-specific characteristics, and prematurely focusing on optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires continuous adaptation, acknowledging inherent biases, and integrating understanding of the specific problem structure. This leads to more robust and efficient solutions.
