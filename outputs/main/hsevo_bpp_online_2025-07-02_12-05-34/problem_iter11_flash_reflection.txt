**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st implementation focuses on carefully tuned weights for various factors (tightness, fill level, near-full penalty, small/large item bonuses) and incorporates stochasticity, while the 20th implementation introduces many parameters as arguments with specific default values and has a more intricate structure. This suggests that adaptive weighting and careful parameter tuning are important.

Comparing (1st) vs (5th), we see the 1st version includes an additional adjustment: 'large item penalty' that discourages placing large items in bins with little space. This considers the item size. 5th version introduce more sophisticated adaptive weighting and scaling penalties based on item size. It also has an empty bin prioritization for large items.  The 1st also has stochasticity.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) (2nd vs 19th), we see version 2nd include target fill level. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), there are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst) (19th vs 20th), we see 20th takes many arguments.

Overall:
The better heuristics seem to focus on a combination of factors, including waste minimization, target fill levels, near-full penalties, and bonuses for certain item sizes. They also incorporate adaptive weighting strategies based on item size and bin states, and often include a degree of stochasticity to promote exploration and avoid local optima. The worst heuristics have lack adaptive weighting strategies.

**Experience:**
Prioritize adaptive weighting based on item characteristics and bin states. Include a combination of waste minimization, target fill consideration, and penalties for undesirable states. Introduce stochasticity for exploration. Fine-tune parameters and weights to achieve optimal performance.
