Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better bin packing heuristics, while avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection." Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, dynamic penalties/bonuses, target fill, stochasticity, item characteristics, bin state.

*   **Advice:** Focus on *how* to make these elements adaptive and dynamic. Develop clear, measurable metrics for bin utilization and item characteristics to drive adaptation. Implement decaying randomness.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex rules, focusing solely on individual factors in isolation, and premature optimization (code duplication before concept validation).

*   **Explanation:** Shift from *what* factors to consider (waste minimization, etc.) to *how* they interact dynamically. The key is creating a feedback loop where item properties and bin states influence weighting, penalties, and randomness. Simpler core logic with sophisticated adaptation is preferred.
