**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no difference; (second best) vs (second worst) also has no difference, which is suspicious. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the key difference lies in the stochasticity. Heuristic 3 scales randomness by remaining bin capacity, while Heuristic 4 uses a decaying randomness based on item size. Heuristic 3's approach seems more context-aware. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), no difference either. Comparing (7th) vs (8th), no difference. Comparing (9th) vs (10th) vs (11th) vs (12th), still no difference.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), Heuristic 1 has more detailed considerations: dynamic near-full management, smaller item bonus, larger item penalty, adaptive weighting considers both item size and bin utilization, and randomness scales with both item size and bin utilization. Heuristic 3 simplifies this to adaptive weighting based on item size and randomness scaled by remaining capacity.

Comparing (3rd) vs (5th), Heuristic 3 includes stochasticity scaled by remaining capacity, while Heuristic 5 uses decaying randomness based on item size. Also no difference between heuristics 4th and 5th.

Comparing (7th) vs (18th), Heuristic 7 uses small item bonus and dynamic bin count penalty, whereas Heuristic 18 uses a near-empty bonus and decaying randomness with item size.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more context-aware parameters, such as bin utilization and item size, when calculating weights, penalties, bonuses, and stochasticity. More advanced ones dynamically adjust target fill levels and learning rates. Penalizing "near-full" bins and rewarding "near-empty" bins seems like a good idea. The decaying randomness is a good pattern.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider adaptive parameters based on problem state (bin utilization, item sizes). Dynamic penalties/bonuses are useful. Decaying randomness encourages exploration early but exploits later. Avoid unnecessary code duplication, as seen in the identical functions with different ranking.
