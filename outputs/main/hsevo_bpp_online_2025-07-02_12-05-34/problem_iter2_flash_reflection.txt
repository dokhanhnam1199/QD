**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic prioritizes bins based on a combination of "fit score" (remaining space after placing the item) and proximity to being half-empty, while the 20th focuses on a target fill ratio (0.6), remaining capacity, and penalizes capacities close to the item size. The 1st heuristic uses inverse of wasted space + boost close to half empty, while 20th uses absolute difference from a specific ratio + remaining capacity + penalty close to item size.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the 2nd version uses an "electrical intuition" approach, incorporating resonance and balance utilization while the 19th prioritizes fill ratio, gives bonus to perfect fit, and adjusts by available capacity. 2nd focuses on resonance for difference while 19th focuses on fill ratio and perfect fit.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the 1st uses inverse of wasted space to give priority and boost to bins close to half empty, while 2nd focuses on electrical intuition using wasted space inversion, resonance amplification, and balance utilization. 1st has simpler logic.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd adds a stochastic element to escape local optima. The 4th heuristic combines waste minimization, fill percentage, and moderate bin utilization. 3rd has randomness + discourages, 4th minimize waste.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the 2nd heuristic is guided by "electrical intuition" while the 3rd introduces stochasticity to avoid local optima. The stochastic element provides exploration.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), the 19th utilizes a fill ratio and perfect fit bonus while the 20th uses an absolute difference from a specific fill ratio combined with remaining capacity and penalty.

Overall: The better heuristics seem to balance several factors such as minimizing waste, promoting utilization, avoiding overfilling, and adding slight stochasticity. They often prioritize fitting items snugly but also consider the bin's overall fill level and how it may affect future placements. Heuristics that are too specific (e.g., targeting a precise fill ratio) or lack exploration (e.g., consistently picking the best fit without randomness) perform worse. Also, simple logic performs better.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics often combine multiple factors like minimizing waste, maximizing utilization, and incorporating randomness. Avoid overly specific rules. Aim for a balance between exploitation (using the best option) and exploration (trying new options) to improve results. Simpler is better.
