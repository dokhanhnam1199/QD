Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better bin packing heuristics, specifically avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Objective weighting, Threshold tuning, Vectorized operations, Randomization strategies, Local optima escape, Fill level targets, Waste minimization.

*   **Advice:** Quantify objective contributions. Experiment with adaptive weighting based on solution progress. Profile code and aggressively optimize bottlenecks, paying close attention to the performance gains from vectorized operations.

*   **Avoid:** Broad generalizations, oversimplification, vague goals (e.g. "balance exploitation/exploration" without concrete mechanisms).

*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply stating principles, focus on actionable steps. Emphasize empirical evaluation and iterative refinement of parameters. Prioritize performance optimization through vectorized operations. Explore specific randomization techniques (e.g., simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) for escaping local optima.
