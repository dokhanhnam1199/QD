Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines waste minimization, target fill, randomness, and near-full penalty.\"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(can_fit):\n        return np.full_like(priorities, 0.0)\n\n    valid_bins = np.where(can_fit)[0]\n    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap[can_fit] - item\n\n    # Waste minimization: Prioritize tighter fits\n    waste = remaining_after\n    tightness = 1 / (waste + 0.0001)\n\n    # Target fill level (e.g., 75%): Reward bins closer to target\n    target_fill_level = 0.75 * bins_remain_cap.max()\n    fill_level = bins_remain_cap[can_fit]\n    fill_diff = np.abs(fill_level - target_fill_level)\n    fill_score = np.exp(-fill_diff / (bins_remain_cap.max() * 0.2)) # Gaussian-like score\n\n    # Near-full penalty\n    near_full_threshold = 0.1 * bins_remain_cap.max()\n    near_full_penalty = np.where(remaining_after < near_full_threshold, -0.5, 0.0)\n\n    # Small item bonus\n    small_item_threshold = bins_remain_cap.max() * 0.2\n    if item < small_item_threshold:\n        almost_full_threshold = bins_remain_cap.max() * 0.1\n        almost_full_bonus = (bins_remain_cap[can_fit] > item) * np.exp(-remaining_after / almost_full_threshold)\n    else:\n        almost_full_bonus = 0\n\n    # Combine scores with weights\n    tightness_weight = 0.4\n    fill_weight = 0.3\n    near_full_weight = 0.2\n    small_item_weight = 0.1\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] = (tightness_weight * tightness +\n                               fill_weight * fill_score +\n                               near_full_weight * near_full_penalty +\n                               small_item_weight * almost_full_bonus)\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics, addressing the shortcomings of \"Ineffective self-reflection.\"\n\nHere's a revised perspective:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective balancing, adaptive weighting, edge case handling, stochasticity, performance tuning, vectorized operations, local optima avoidance.\n\n*   **Advice:** Rigorously define objectives. Implement adaptive weighting schemes for factors *grounded in problem characteristics*. Design specific responses (bonuses/penalties) for edge cases *after thorough analysis*. Systematically test stochastic elements. Optimize for speed.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague objectives, premature simplification, solely intuition-based weighting, and neglecting implementation efficiency.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a structured approach: explicitly defining objectives, adapting strategies based on problem dynamics, addressing exceptions thoughtfully, and empirically validating the heuristic's performance and robustness.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
