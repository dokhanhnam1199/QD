Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one target fill level while the second uses target fill level and gaussian-like score. (3rd) vs (4th) ... we see the 3rd uses tightness, fullness and balance score. the 4th is about wasted space minimization, fill target and randomness. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the 19th has waste minimization, target fill, penalty for near-full, and randomness factors. The 20th has the same factors. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors (waste minimization, target fill, penalties, randomness) and often use weighting or more complex scoring functions to balance these factors. Poorer heuristics may oversimplify or lack specific handling for edge cases (e.g., nearly full bins).\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics, addressing the shortcomings of \"Ineffective self-reflection.\"\n\nHere's a revised perspective:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective balancing, adaptive weighting, edge case handling, stochasticity, performance tuning, vectorized operations, local optima avoidance.\n\n*   **Advice:** Rigorously define objectives. Implement adaptive weighting schemes for factors *grounded in problem characteristics*. Design specific responses (bonuses/penalties) for edge cases *after thorough analysis*. Systematically test stochastic elements. Optimize for speed.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague objectives, premature simplification, solely intuition-based weighting, and neglecting implementation efficiency.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a structured approach: explicitly defining objectives, adapting strategies based on problem dynamics, addressing exceptions thoughtfully, and empirically validating the heuristic's performance and robustness.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
