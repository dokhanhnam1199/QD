**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are exactly the same. This indicates redundancy in the list.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), 3rd introduces `fullness_score` and `too_close_threshold` which are not present in the 4th. 3rd gives higher priority to bins that are relatively full using `fullness_score` and penalizes bins that are too close in size to the item using `too_close_threshold`. 4th boosts priority for bins with remaining capacity close to the item size (using `item_proximity_score`), prioritizes fuller bins and penalizes bins that become too empty after placing the item.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), the fifth gives a negative infinity if no bins are valid. The fifth prioritizes `waste` minimization and `fill_percentage`. The 4th prioritizes item proximity and full bins, adding penalty if they become too empty.

Comparing (1st) vs (6th), 6th prioritizes item proximity and full bins adding penalty if they become too empty. The first only minimizes space.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), 7th uses fill ratio and wasted space. 8th combines waste minimization, fill percentage, and bin balancing. if not np.any(fit_within_capacity) on 7th the priorities are calculated based on ratio between bin size and item size, while if no bin can fit on 8th, all priorities are assigned negative infinite values.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), identical again.

Comparing (11th) vs (1st), 11th takes additional parameters such as `division_avoidance`, `half_empty_weight`, `fullness_weight`, `too_close_fraction`, `too_close_penalty`. but the code is uncompleted as it misses other parts after handling valid bins.

Comparing (12th) vs (1st), 12th adds residual capacity, close fit and capacity utilization ration, but lacks the avoidance of division by zero.

Comparing (13th) vs (1st), the later favors bins with remaining capacity close to a target value. It also includes bin usage counts, which would require storing state between calls. First only prioritizes minimization of wasted space.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th), the same again.

Comparing (16th) vs (1st), 16th target a fill ratio using a gaussian curve.

Comparing (17th) vs (1st), 17th iterates the capacities one by one.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), 19th adds a balance factor considering target fill level (e.g., 75%), small randomness and penalizes near full bins. The 20th utilizes randomness and prioritizes capacity close to the average.

Overall: The better heuristics attempt to balance several factors: minimizing wasted space, targeting a fill level, avoiding bins that become too full or too empty, and some randomness to avoid local optima. The worse ones often lack one or more of these considerations or are incomplete. Also, the better heuristics, use of numpy allows for calculation across all bins at once rather than looping.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for bin packing involve balancing several objectives: minimizing waste, targeting fill levels, and preventing overfilling. Incorporating randomness can help escape local optima. Efficient implementations leverage vectorized operations for speed. Tuning the weights of different objectives and thresholds are crucial.
