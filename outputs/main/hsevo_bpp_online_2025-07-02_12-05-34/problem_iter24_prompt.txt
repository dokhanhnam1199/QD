Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Develop clear, measurable metrics for bin utilization and item characteristics to drive adaptation. Implement decaying randomness.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex rules, focusing solely on individual factors in isolation, and premature optimization (code duplication before concept validation).\n\n*   **Explanation:** Shift from *what* factors to consider (waste minimization, etc.) to *how* they interact dynamically. The key is creating a feedback loop where item properties and bin states influence weighting, penalties, and randomness. Simpler core logic with sophisticated adaptation is preferred.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
