**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no difference. Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we observe that the best heuristic incorporates a learning rate to adapt the weights of tightness and fill, strategic randomness that decays based on item size and bin utilization, and a dynamic near-full management system. The 20th heuristic uses a simpler static weighting and a different approach to target fill levels, using a combination of low and high thresholds. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), (1st) uses adaptive weighting and randomness while (3rd) uses static weighting. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), (4th) has adaptive weighting and strategic randomness. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst incorporates a small item bonus and adaptive weighting, while the worst only focuses on waste minimization and adaptive penalties without dynamically adjusting the weights or utilizing any bonus system for small items. Comparing (11th) vs (12th), we see no difference. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the key difference is that (11th) introduces small and large item bonuses and penalties and adjusts target fill based on average bin utilization. Overall: the better heuristics incorporate adaptive weighting based on item size and bin utilization, strategic randomness, dynamic penalties and bonuses based on item size and bin state, and adaptive target fill levels. They also tend to have more sophisticated methods for waste minimization.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for bin packing require adaptive strategies that consider item sizes, bin utilization, and remaining capacities. Incorporating dynamic penalties/bonuses, decaying randomness, and adjusting target fill levels improves packing efficiency. Adaptive weighting based on learning rates can refine the heuristic's performance over time.
