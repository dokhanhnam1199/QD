Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing better bin packing heuristics, while explicitly avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a breakdown to guide the process:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, dynamic adjustment, multi-objective balancing, stochastic exploration, performance feedback.

*   **Advice:** Focus on learning from past packing outcomes to dynamically adjust parameters like target fill levels, penalty/bonus weights, and the degree of randomness. Use a multi-objective approach that explicitly models different performance goals (waste, fill, balance).

*   **Avoid:** Broad, generic statements like "simpler is better" or "consider multiple factors." Avoid feature repetition and focusing on static configurations of heuristics.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to learn and adapt. A system for tracking performance and feeding that back into heuristic parameter adjustment is key. The learning should adjust the balance between conflicting objectives. Instead of just saying "use randomness," focus on strategies like decaying randomness or randomness driven by performance.
