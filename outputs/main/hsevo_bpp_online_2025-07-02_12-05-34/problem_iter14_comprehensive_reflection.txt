Okay, I will help you redefine 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection' and aiming for actionable insights.

Here's a refined perspective:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, stochasticity, multi-objective, parameter tuning, dynamic penalties/bonuses, item characteristics, bin state.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust their behavior based on item features and current bin configurations. Employ stochastic elements for broader exploration and fine-tune parameters through experimentation.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches. Don't neglect the balance between exploration and exploitation.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on creating flexible heuristics that respond intelligently to the problem's state. Parameter tuning is crucial to get optimal results. The system should learn during the process.
