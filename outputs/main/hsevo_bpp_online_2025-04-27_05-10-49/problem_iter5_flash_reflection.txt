**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see 1st uses waste minimization, capacity threshold, bin utilization balancing, item size awareness, and random perturbation with parameter tuning while the 20th use gravity/velocity with capacity and a buffer, lacking parameter tuning and random perturbation.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see 2nd uses waste minimization, capacity threshold, bin utilization balancing, item size awareness, and random perturbation with parameter tuning while the 19th use gravity/velocity with capacity and a buffer, lacking parameter tuning and random perturbation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the two are identical, likely a copy-paste error. (3rd) vs (4th) also shows identical code, likely a copy-paste error. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the two are identical, likely a copy-paste error. Overall: The best heuristics include multiple factors (waste, capacity, utilization, item size, randomness), use parameter tuning and more sophisticated equations (exponential, sigmoid). Poorer heuristics focus on fewer factors and simpler equations, without parameter tuning. Specifically, the better heuristics prioritize a combination of waste minimization, bin utilization balancing, item size considerations, and random perturbation, often employing techniques like sigmoid scaling and adaptive adjustments. They also include mechanisms to avoid fragmentation. The worse heuristics tend to focus on a smaller subset of these factors, use simpler mathematical formulations, and lack adaptive or dynamic adjustments based on problem characteristics. The penalty terms for infeasible bins are also better handled in the top-ranked functions.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, especially waste minimization, bin utilization, and item size. Introduce adaptability through parameter tuning or dynamic adjustments based on problem characteristics. Add a small random factor to help to avoid local optimums.
