           completely empty or completely full to maintain flexibility.

           in local optima and explore slightly different packing arrangements.

### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function incorporates several factors to improve bin packing:
    1.  Remaining capacity: Bins with capacity closer to the item size are preferred (First Fit Decreasing-like).
    2.  Number of items already in the bin:  Slight preference for bins with fewer items. Not directly tracked, so proxy with remaining capacity.
    3. Penalize bins where the item won't fit.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # 1. Capacity considerations
    capacity_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)  # Difference between remaining capacity and item size
    priorities = 1.0 / (1e-6 + capacity_diff) # Prefer bins with closer capacities

    # 2. Small bias towards filling emptier bins. This is implicit from larger remaining capacity

    # 3. Massive penalty for bins where the item won't fit.
    infeasible_mask = item > bins_remain_cap
    priorities[infeasible_mask] = -np.inf

    # Some scaling and smoothing to make function better behaved (prevent numerical overflow)
    priorities = np.nan_to_num(priorities, neginf=-np.inf)  #Handles bins with 0 remaining capacity cleanly when item >0.
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Ensure no division by zero or negative values (invalid bin capacities)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0
    
    if not np.any(valid_bins):
        return np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf) #All bins are full or invalid.
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    
    # First, prioritize bins that can actually fit the item.  Inertia favors those that fit
    fit_mask = (bins_remain_cap >= item) & valid_bins
    
    # If there are bins that fit the item:
    if np.any(fit_mask):

        fill_ratios = item / bins_remain_cap[fit_mask]
        
        #Refined Gravitational constant
        gravitational_constant = 1.0
        
        # Higher score if we nearly fill the bin. This ensures better utilization.
        priorities[fit_mask] = gravitational_constant * (1 - np.abs(1 - fill_ratios))

        # Slightly incentivize using the fullest bin if several will work. This acts like attraction to fuller states, more compact packing
        priorities[fit_mask] += 0.1 * bins_remain_cap[fit_mask] / bins_remain_cap[fit_mask].max()
    
    #If NO bins can fit: force select an empty bin
    else:
        # No bins can fit! Place in an empty bin, if one exists. Otherwise, ignore. This prevents wasted space.
        empty_mask = (bins_remain_cap == bins_remain_cap.max()) & valid_bins #Largest, ie., most likely to be new
        if np.any(empty_mask):
            priorities[empty_mask] = 0.5  # small pull to initialize a new empty bin
        else:
            return np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf) # All bins are full, should theoretically not reach this given online BPP framework
    
    # Finally, prevent placing items in invalid bins:
    priorities[~valid_bins] = -np.inf
    
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses waste minimization, capacity threshold, bin utilization balancing, and random perturbation, while the worst only considers relative capacity and a small buffer penalty. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar pattern: the former utilizes capacity considerations and penalizes infeasible bins, while the latter focuses on relative capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the incorporation of randomness and a parabolic preference curve for bin utilization in the best heuristic, which are absent in the second. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals that using a Gaussian-like function to prioritize minimal waste is more effective than simply considering the difference between remaining capacity and item size. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, representing a local optimum. Overall: The top heuristics combine multiple factors like waste minimization, capacity considerations, and bin utilization, along with randomness to avoid local optima. They also use more sophisticated functions (e.g., exponential decay, Gaussian) to prioritize bins. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on relative capacity or basic feasibility checks perform worse.
- 
Okay, I'm ready to aim for that $999K tip! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls, while addressing your prompt's guidance.

Here's the redefined "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Complexity, Non-linearity, Diversification, Exploration, Adaptation, Granularity, Context.
*   **Advice:** Embrace multi-faceted evaluation functions and adaptive strategies, and tailor the heuristic's response to contextual cues.
*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, premature convergence, and neglecting problem-specific knowledge.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance problem simplification with capturing essential complexities. Prioritize adaptation to changing conditions, context, and exploration of the search space through diversified approaches.


Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Employs a combination of heuristics:
        1. Waste Minimization: Prioritizes bins where the remaining space after
           packing the item is minimal.  A near-perfect fit is highly valued.
        2. Capacity Threshold: Avoids bins with extremely small remaining
           capacity to reduce fragmentation. Bins that cannot fit are penalized.
        3. Balancing Bin Utilization:  Slight preference for bins that are not
           completely empty or completely full to maintain flexibility.
        4. Random Perturbation: Introduces small randomness to avoid getting stuck
           in local optima and explore slightly different packing arrangements.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Waste Minimization & Capacity Threshold
    waste = bins_remain_cap - item
    too_small = waste < 0
    priorities[too_small] = -np.inf  # Never put item in bins that are too small.
    waste[too_small] = np.inf

    # Near-perfect fit bonus (minimize waste)
    priorities += np.exp(-waste)  # Exponential decay for increasing waste.

    # Bin utilization balancing - slightly prefers bins that aren't empty or full.  avoids extremities.  Parabolic preference
    bin_fraction = bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities += -(bin_fraction - 0.5)**2  # Adds a parabolic preference curve.

    # Random Perturbation (introduces some "quantum" fluctuation). Very small value for numerical stability
    priorities += np.random.normal(0, 0.01, size=bins_remain_cap.shape)

    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.

Okay, I'm ready to aim for that $999K tip! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls, while addressing your prompt's guidance.

Here's the redefined "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Complexity, Non-linearity, Diversification, Exploration, Adaptation, Granularity, Context.
*   **Advice:** Embrace multi-faceted evaluation functions and adaptive strategies, and tailor the heuristic's response to contextual cues.
*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, premature convergence, and neglecting problem-specific knowledge.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance problem simplification with capturing essential complexities. Prioritize adaptation to changing conditions, context, and exploration of the search space through diversified approaches.


Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!
