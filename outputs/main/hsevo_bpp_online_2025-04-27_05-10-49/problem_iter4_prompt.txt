Waste Minimization: Prioritizes bins where the remaining space after\n           packing the item is minimal.  A near-perfect fit is highly valued.\n        2. Capacity Threshold: Avoids bins with extremely small remaining\n           capacity to reduce fragmentation. Bins that cannot fit are penalized.\n        3. Bin Level Awareness : Considers the initial capacity of the bins for a more balanced distribution\n        4. Balancing Bin Utilization:  Slight preference for bins that are not\n           completely empty or completely full to maintain flexibility.\n        5. Random Perturbation: Introduces small randomness to avoid getting stuck\n           in local optima and explore slightly different packing arrangements.\n        6.
