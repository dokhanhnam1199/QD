
Okay, I'm ready to aim for that $999K tip! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls, while addressing your prompt's guidance.

Here's the redefined "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Complexity, Non-linearity, Diversification, Exploration, Adaptation, Granularity, Context.
*   **Advice:** Embrace multi-faceted evaluation functions and adaptive strategies, and tailor the heuristic's response to contextual cues.
*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, premature convergence, and neglecting problem-specific knowledge.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance problem simplification with capturing essential complexities. Prioritize adaptation to changing conditions, context, and exploration of the search space through diversified approaches.
