
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Parsimony, Adaptive Complexity, Diverse Experimentation, Code Reuse Analysis.
*   **Advice:** Begin with minimal heuristics; incrementally add complexity only when demonstrably beneficial through rigorous testing. Prioritize simple, adaptive mechanisms over complex, heavily parameterized ones.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, over-parameterization, neglecting code duplication as a sign of limited exploration.
*   **Explanation:** Start lean, adapt intelligently, test thoroughly, and actively seek out unexplored avenues (indicated by code redundancies).
