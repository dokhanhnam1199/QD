**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses waste minimization, capacity threshold, bin utilization balancing, and random perturbation, while the worst only considers relative capacity and a small buffer penalty. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar pattern: the former utilizes capacity considerations and penalizes infeasible bins, while the latter focuses on relative capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the incorporation of randomness and a parabolic preference curve for bin utilization in the best heuristic, which are absent in the second. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals that using a Gaussian-like function to prioritize minimal waste is more effective than simply considering the difference between remaining capacity and item size. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, representing a local optimum. Overall: The top heuristics combine multiple factors like waste minimization, capacity considerations, and bin utilization, along with randomness to avoid local optima. They also use more sophisticated functions (e.g., exponential decay, Gaussian) to prioritize bins. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on relative capacity or basic feasibility checks perform worse.

**Experience:**

Combining multiple, diverse factors with carefully tuned weights and considering non-linear relationships (e.g., exponential decay for waste) improves heuristic performance. Introducing randomness can help escape local optima. Avoid oversimplification, as it leads to suboptimal solutions.
