    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Employs a combination of heuristics:
        1. Waste Minimization: Prioritizes bins where the remaining space after
           packing the item is minimal.  A near-perfect fit is highly valued.
        2. Capacity Threshold: Avoids bins with extremely small remaining
           capacity to reduce fragmentation. Bins that cannot fit are penalized.
        3. Bin Level Awareness : Considers the initial capacity of the bins for a more balanced distribution
        4. Balancing Bin Utilization:  Slight preference for bins that are not
           completely empty or completely full to maintain flexibility.
        5. Random Perturbation: Introduces small randomness to avoid getting stuck
           in local optima and explore slightly different packing arrangements.
        6. Item size awareness : Larger Items should fill bins as much as possible
        7. Capacity Usage: Prioritizes bins that are already somewhat full, encouraging efficient bin usage.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        waste_penalty_factor: Factor to adjust the impact of waste minimization.
        bin_fraction_penalty: Factor to adjust the balancing of bin utilization.
        item_size_weight: Weight of item size awareness.
        random_perturbation_scale: Scale of random noise.
        capacity_usage_weight: Weight for prioritizing bins that are already somewhat full.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
