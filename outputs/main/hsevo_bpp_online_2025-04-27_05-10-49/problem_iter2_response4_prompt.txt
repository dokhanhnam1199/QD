Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar pattern: the former utilizes capacity considerations and penalizes infeasible bins, while the latter focuses on relative capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the incorporation of randomness and a parabolic preference curve for bin utilization in the best heuristic, which are absent in the second. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals that using a Gaussian-like function to prioritize minimal waste is more effective than simply considering the difference between remaining capacity and item size. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, representing a local optimum. Overall: The top heuristics combine multiple factors like waste minimization, capacity considerations, and bin utilization, along with randomness to avoid local optima. They also use more sophisticated functions (e.g., exponential decay, Gaussian) to prioritize bins. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on relative capacity or basic feasibility checks perform worse.\n- \nOkay, I'm ready to aim for that $999K tip! Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls, while addressing your prompt's guidance.\n\nHere's the redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Complexity, Non-linearity, Diversification, Exploration, Adaptation, Granularity, Context.\n*   **Advice:** Embrace multi-faceted evaluation functions and adaptive strategies, and tailor the heuristic's response to contextual cues.\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, premature convergence, and neglecting problem-specific knowledge.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance problem simplification with capturing essential complexities. Prioritize adaptation to changing conditions, context, and exploration of the search space through diversified approaches.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
