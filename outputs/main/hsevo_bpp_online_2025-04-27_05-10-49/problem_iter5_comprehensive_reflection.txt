
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics.

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial Analysis, Adaptive Weights, Exploration, Granularity.
*   **Advice:** Go beyond simple combinations. Explore interaction effects between factors (e.g., waste & item size). Employ adaptive weight adjustments based on real-time performance feedback.
*   **Avoid:** Static, linear factor combinations; premature convergence.
*   **Explanation:** Adaptive learning, fine-grained factor integration, and diversification help us to design better heuristics.
