{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nStart with a solid core of heuristics and add complexity only when needed. Adaptive components can be helpful, but keep the design simple, avoiding over-parameterization. Diverse experimentation is key for identifying effective approaches. Code duplication hints at a lack of diverse exploration.\n```\nCombining multiple, diverse factors with carefully tuned weights and considering non-linear relationships (e.g., exponential decay for waste) improves heuristic performance. Introducing randomness can help escape local optima. Avoid oversimplification, as it leads to suboptimal solutions.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, especially waste minimization, bin utilization, and item size. Introduce adaptability through parameter tuning or dynamic adjustments based on problem characteristics. Add a small random factor to help to avoid local optimums.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
