**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st has fewer adaptive components and simpler logic. The 20th has more parameters and conditional adjustments based on item size, making it more complex but not necessarily better.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we observe that the 2nd and the 19th are nearly identical. This implies code duplication, and a possible lack of significant experimentation between these versions.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd includes weighted scores for waste, utilization, item size, and a "gravity" component, while the 4th simplifies to waste minimization, bin utilization, item size awareness, and adaptive randomness. The 3rd's use of separate weights for each component may offer finer control, but also more parameters to tune.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the 19th and 20th focus on adaptive scaling, conditional logic based on item size, and capacity usage. The 20th introduces capacity usage factor, emphasizes interaction effects between waste and item size and adaptive scaling based on item size.

Overall: The better heuristics tend to be simpler and rely on a core set of principles (waste minimization, bin utilization balancing, item size awareness, and randomness), while the worse heuristics try to introduce more complex adaptive mechanisms which is not necessary. Also, duplication might reveal lack of diversity in experiments. Simplicity and core concepts appears more robust.

**Experience:**
Start with a solid core of heuristics and add complexity only when needed. Adaptive components can be helpful, but keep the design simple, avoiding over-parameterization. Diverse experimentation is key for identifying effective approaches. Code duplication hints at a lack of diverse exploration.
