Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritizes bins considering fit and remaining space variance.\"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    for i, remaining_capacity in enumerate(bins_remain_cap):\n        if item <= remaining_capacity:\n            remaining_space = remaining_capacity - item\n            fit_score = 1.0 / (remaining_space + 0.01)\n\n            # Penalize extreme remaining space relative to item size.\n            size_ratio_penalty = np.abs(item / remaining_capacity - 0.5)\n\n            priorities[i] = fit_score - size_ratio_penalty\n        else:\n            priorities[i] = -np.inf\n\n    # Normalize priorities to improve numerical stability.

The first one considers both fit and efficient space utilization, while the 20th simply prioritizes bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining capacity. (second best) vs (second worst), heuristics are very similar. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the second heuristic normalizes the priorities, which can improve numerical stability but doesn't necessarily lead to better packing. (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that function are very similar. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize a balance between fitting the item well (small remaining space) and avoiding excessive fragmentation (penalizing very small remaining space or filling bins with tiny items). Normalization doesn't necessarily improve packing performance. Simpler ratio-based approaches appear to be less effective than those that incorporate fit and fragmentation considerations. Introducing epsilon and size_ratio_target are useless.\n- \nOkay, I understand. Let's refine \"current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing better bin packing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of the \"ineffective\" example.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Fit quality, fragmentation control, simplicity, adaptability, edge-case handling.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics that dynamically adapt to item size distributions and bin capacities. Emphasize strategies that minimize *both* wasted space and the number of bins used.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization based solely on average-case performance. Resist adding parameters without a clear understanding of their impact on solution quality and computational cost.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should aim for a sweet spot between solution quality, computation complexity, and adaptability to diverse problem characteristics. Focus on methods that gracefully handle edge cases, such as very small or large items, without adding significant overhead.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
