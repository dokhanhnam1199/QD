**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates a 'fit score' based on remaining space and a 'size ratio penalty' to avoid extreme fragmentation, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the item-to-capacity ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst) doesn't exist because of the odd number of heuristics. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the best one adds configurability via parameters like `fit_score_epsilon`, `size_ratio_center`, and `size_ratio_weight`. (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd one doesn't normalize priorities, the 4th one does. Comparing (19th) vs (20th), the functions are identical. Overall: The better heuristics consider both how well an item fits into a bin and the potential for fragmentation, often normalizing the priority scores and providing adjustable parameters to fine-tune the behavior. Simpler heuristics only focus on the ratio of item size to bin capacity. The best heuristics include a size ratio penalty and tunable parameters. Normalizing priorities also seems to help. A well-crafted docstring also seems important.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider a combination of factors (e.g., fit, fragmentation) and allow for fine-tuning through parameters. Normalization can improve stability. Clear documentation is also critical for maintainability and understanding.
