Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more actionable and less like the "Ineffective" example, focusing on design principles for better heuristics:

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor evaluation, fragmentation cost, parameter tuning, numerical stability.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that evaluate multiple aspects of a packing decision (fit, fragmentation impact). Quantify fragmentation cost to penalize bad space usage. Use parameters for fine-grained control. Normalize *when* it demonstrably improves stability.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification based only on ratios, assuming normalization *always* helps, rigid parameter settings (allow instance-specific tuning).

*   **Explanation:** Better heuristics look at multiple factors and parameterization is to make them robust to various bin-packing instances with varying properties. Normalization should only be applied when it is clearly improving numerical stability during evaluation and/or operation.
