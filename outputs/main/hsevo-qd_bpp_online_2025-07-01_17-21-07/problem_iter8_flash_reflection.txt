**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first uses a complex scoring function that considers remaining capacity and a size ratio penalty, while the last only uses the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third normalizes the priorities, which can help with numerical stability, but the fourth does not. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), (1st) has configurable parameters while (3rd) has hardcoded parameters; (3rd) normalizes the priorites while (1st) does not.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a notion of "best fit" by penalizing bins that are either too full or not full enough, and may include normalization for numerical stability. The worst heuristics rely solely on a simple ratio calculation and lack any mechanism for fine-tuning or preventing numerical issues.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors that contribute to the quality of the solution. Additionally, normalizing scores can improve numerical stability and prevent divergence. Parameterizing the heuristics allows for better fine-tuning for specific problem instances.
