{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors that contribute to the quality of the solution. Additionally, normalizing scores can improve numerical stability and prevent divergence. Parameterizing the heuristics allows for better fine-tuning for specific problem instances.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider incorporating multiple factors beyond simple ratios. Penalize situations that lead to significant wasted space within bins. A more comprehensive evaluation of fit, considering both tightness and the avoidance of excessive space, can lead to improved performance.\n\nWhen designing bin packing heuristics, focus on balancing fit and fragmentation. Prioritize bins where the item fits well without leaving excessive space. Normalization might not always improve packing and adds complexity. Avoid over-parameterization; simpler models are easier to manage.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
