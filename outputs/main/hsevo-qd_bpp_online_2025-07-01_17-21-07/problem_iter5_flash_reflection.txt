**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic calculates a fit score based on remaining space and a size ratio penalty to avoid filling bins with items that are too small or leave very little space, while the 20th calculates a priority based on the negative log of the ratio of the item size to the remaining bin capacity. The first one considers both fit and efficient space utilization, while the 20th simply prioritizes bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining capacity. (second best) vs (second worst), heuristics are very similar. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the second heuristic normalizes the priorities, which can improve numerical stability but doesn't necessarily lead to better packing. (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that function are very similar. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize a balance between fitting the item well (small remaining space) and avoiding excessive fragmentation (penalizing very small remaining space or filling bins with tiny items). Normalization doesn't necessarily improve packing performance. Simpler ratio-based approaches appear to be less effective than those that incorporate fit and fragmentation considerations. Introducing epsilon and size_ratio_target are useless.

**Experience:**
When designing bin packing heuristics, focus on balancing fit and fragmentation. Prioritize bins where the item fits well without leaving excessive space. Normalization might not always improve packing and adds complexity. Avoid over-parameterization; simpler models are easier to manage.
