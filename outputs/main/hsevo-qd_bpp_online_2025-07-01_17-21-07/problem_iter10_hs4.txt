    This priority function considers both the remaining capacity of the bin
    and how well the item fits relative to that capacity. Bins with capacity
    slightly larger than the item are preferred (best fit). It penalizes
    bins where the item would result in very little space left or bins where
    the item is too small relative to the available space.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        fit_score_epsilon: small constant to avoid division by zero problems or infinite penalties
        size_ratio_target: target value for the size ratio (item/remaining_capacity)
        size_ratio_penalty_weight: Weight of the size ratio penalty.
