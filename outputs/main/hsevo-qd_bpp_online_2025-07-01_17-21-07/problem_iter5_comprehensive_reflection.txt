Okay, I understand. Let's refine "current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing better bin packing heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of the "ineffective" example.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Fit quality, fragmentation control, simplicity, adaptability, edge-case handling.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics that dynamically adapt to item size distributions and bin capacities. Emphasize strategies that minimize *both* wasted space and the number of bins used.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization based solely on average-case performance. Resist adding parameters without a clear understanding of their impact on solution quality and computational cost.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics should aim for a sweet spot between solution quality, computation complexity, and adaptability to diverse problem characteristics. Focus on methods that gracefully handle edge cases, such as very small or large items, without adding significant overhead.
