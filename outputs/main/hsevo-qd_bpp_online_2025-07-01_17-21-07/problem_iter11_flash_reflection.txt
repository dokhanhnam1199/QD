**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates a fit score based on remaining space and a size ratio penalty, while the worst only considers the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. The best uses `1.0 / (remaining_space + fit_score_epsilon)` for `fit_score`, and `size_ratio_penalty = size_ratio_weight * np.abs(item/remaining_capacity - size_ratio_center)`, while the worst directly calculates `ratios = item / bins_remain_cap`, `log_ratios = np.log(ratios)` and returns `-log_ratios`.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), heuristics are almost identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the code is identical, suggesting ranking is based on factors outside the scope of the code itself (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, experimental setup, dataset properties).

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), heuristics are almost identical.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the main difference lies in the use of logarithm. The second worst computes priorities as `-log_ratios` based on the ratio of item size to bin capacity, while the worst also does the same, so they are identical.

Overall:

The better heuristics use a combination of "fit score" (based on remaining space) and a "size ratio penalty," with the fit score incentivizing minimal remaining space, and the size ratio penalty discouraging the item from being either too small or too large relative to the bin's capacity. Normalization and careful handling of edge cases (e.g., preventing division by zero) also appear beneficial. Simpler approaches using only item-to-capacity ratios or their logarithms perform poorly. Parameter tuning (e.g., `fit_score_epsilon`, `size_ratio_center`, `size_ratio_weight`) seems crucial. The use of absolute difference in size ratio calculations is better than simple ratios or logarithmic ratios. Normalization appears to improve numerical stability.

**Experience:**

When designing bin packing heuristics, consider both how well an item fits and the resulting fragmentation. Penalize extreme ratios between item size and bin capacity. Carefully choose and tune parameters to balance these factors. Normalization can improve robustness.
