Okay, let's redefine effective self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Comprehensive evaluation, adaptive parameterization, problem-specific tuning, stability analysis.

*   **Advice:** Evaluate heuristics using diverse problem instances, adapt parameters based on performance feedback, and analyze solution stability.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, over-reliance on single metrics, neglecting problem-specific characteristics.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves rigorously testing, adapting, and analyzing heuristic performance within the context of the specific problem.
