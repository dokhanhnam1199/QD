**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers both the remaining capacity of the bin and how well the item fits relative to that capacity, penalizing bins where the item would result in very little space left or where the item is too small relative to the available space. Conversely, the worst heuristic calculates priorities solely based on the negative logarithm of the ratio between the item size and remaining bin capacity. There is a big difference in design concept.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the trend remains the same, highlighting the importance of a nuanced fit assessment over simple ratio-based prioritization. They are almost identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), there is no difference.

Comparing (11th) vs (20th), they are identical.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics in this list prioritize a more detailed evaluation of how well an item fits into a bin, considering both remaining capacity and the potential for wasted space, while the worst heuristics rely on simpler ratio-based calculations. This suggests that heuristics incorporating multiple factors and penalties for poor fits tend to perform better in bin packing problems.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider incorporating multiple factors beyond simple ratios. Penalize situations that lead to significant wasted space within bins. A more comprehensive evaluation of fit, considering both tightness and the avoidance of excessive space, can lead to improved performance.
