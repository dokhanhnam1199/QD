Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better bin packing heuristics, steering clear of ineffective approaches.

*   **Keywords:** Holistic Evaluation, Waste Minimization, Multi-Factorial, Tight Packing.
*   **Advice:** Move beyond simple ratios. Analyze "waste profiles" within bins. Develop heuristics that actively seek to minimize the variance of remaining space across bins, penalizing highly unbalanced packing.
*   **Avoid:** Solely relying on first-fit or best-fit based on immediate item size; ignoring the impact of current placement on future packing.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics need to be future-aware. A holistic view, penalizing bins with large or oddly shaped remaining spaces, prevents early sub-optimal decisions that severely limit later placement options.
