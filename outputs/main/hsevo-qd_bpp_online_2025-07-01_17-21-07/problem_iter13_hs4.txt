    This priority function considers both the remaining capacity of the bin
    and how well the item fits relative to that capacity. Bins with capacity
    slightly larger than the item are preferred (best fit). It penalizes
    bins where the item would result in very little space left or bins where
    the item is too small relative to the available space.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        fit_score_epsilon: Small constant added to remaining space to avoid division by zero.
        size_ratio_target: Target ratio of item size to remaining capacity (item/remaining_capacity).
        size_ratio_weight: Weight of the size ratio penalty in the overall priority score.
        no_fit_priority: Priority assigned when the item doesn't fit in the bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
