**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates distance, demand, and location, while the worst only considers distance. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we observe the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical, suggesting no measurable difference or that these are equivalent implementations. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) they also are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical and both only use distance. Overall: The top heuristics leverage multiple factors for a more informed edge prioritization, while the bottom ones rely solely on distance, demonstrating the importance of considering demand and spatial relationships for CVRP heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing CVRP heuristics, prioritize incorporating diverse factors like distance, demand, and location for more effective edge selection. Experiment with different weighting strategies for these factors to fine-tune performance. Normalizing heuristics can also improve stability and comparison across different problem instances.
