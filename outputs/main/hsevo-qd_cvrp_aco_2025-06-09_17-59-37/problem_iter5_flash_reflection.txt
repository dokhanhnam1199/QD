**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (17th), we see the best heuristic incorporates distance, demand, location, depot proximity, and connectivity, with adaptive sparsification and normalization, while the worst only considers inverse distance. (2nd) vs (18th), (3rd) vs (19th), (4th) vs (20th) are similar to (1st) vs (17th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no differences. (3rd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (6th) are similar to (1st) vs (2nd). Comparing (16th) vs (17th), we see the 16th uses distance, demand and location-based factors and boost depot connection, while the worst only considers inverse distance. Comparing (7th) vs (17th), we see the 7th combines distance, demand, location with a sparsification based on a dynamic threshold, while the worst only considers inverse distance. Comparing (7th) vs (8th), (9th) vs (10th), (11th) vs (12th), (13th) vs (14th), (15th) vs (16th), we see no differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no differences. Overall: The top heuristics are significantly more complex, incorporating multiple factors and adaptive techniques, while the worst relies solely on distance. The adaptive sparsification and connectivity prior appear to be distinguishing factors among the better heuristics. The enhanced heuristics (1st to 6th) also seem to normalize the matrix.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors (distance, demand, location) with adaptive techniques like sparsification and connectivity priors. Normalization is also a good practice. Start with a strong base heuristic and incrementally add complexity, evaluating the impact of each addition.
