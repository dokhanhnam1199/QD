**Analysis:**
Comparing heuristics 1st to 5th vs heuristics 15th to 20th, we see that the top performers incorporate several factors (distance, demand, location, depot proximity, connectivity, and adaptive sparsification), while the worst only consider distance. The better heuristics use more complex calculations and normalizations. The better heuristics use loops in the logic. Comparing 1st vs 2nd, we observe the removal of distant high demand edges. Comparing 6th vs 7th, and 11th vs 12th, there are no differences. Comparing 9th vs 10th, there are no differences. Comparing 13th vs 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th, there are no differences. Comparing 1st and 6th, we see that the more aggressive sparsification is removed. Comparing 1st vs 9th, some changes related to demand penalty are noted. Overall: The best heuristics consider more factors and more sophisticated interactions between those factors. Sparsification seems useful to an extent.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and how they interact. Start with a baseline heuristic (e.g., distance) and iteratively add factors, carefully evaluating the impact of each addition. Sparsification can be useful, but the aggressiveness needs to be tuned.
