- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a reframed "Current Self-Reflection" aimed at designing better CVRP heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement, Normalization, Sparsification, Performance Evaluation, Problem Characteristics.
*   **Advice:** Build heuristics incrementally by adding relevant factors (distance, demand, location) to a basic heuristic. Employ adaptive sparsification and normalization techniques. Evaluate impact of each change using different problem characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, static parameters, neglecting normalization, solely distance-based approaches, ignoring problem-specific nuances.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a balanced approach. Start simple, add complexity deliberately, and always measure performance across diverse CVRP instances.
