- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable improvements.

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, factor integration, adaptive strategies, impact evaluation, normalization.

*   **Advice:** Systematically evaluate the impact of each added factor or adaptive component on heuristic performance. Track performance metrics rigorously.

*   **Avoid:** Intuitive leaps without empirical validation; premature optimization without a solid baseline.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on incremental improvements with data-driven decisions. Each change must be justified by its impact on solution quality. Normalize data to ensure fair comparison.
