**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates several factors like distance, demand, location, depot proximity, connectivity and adaptive sparsification, while the worst only considers distance. (2nd) to (17th) have some similar code about inverse of distance. Comparing (2nd) vs (17th), we see that the second best adds sophisticated demand penalties, location proximity, depot connection boosts, connectivity prior and sparsification. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe the inclusion of depot sparsification and the use of both mean and median in adaptive sparsification results in performance improvement. Comparing (5th) vs (6th), we find that the same. Comparing (7th) vs (8th) vs ... vs (16th), we find that the same. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), there is no difference, then (3rd) vs (4th) also the same. Overall: The best heuristics combine multiple relevant factors and use adaptive techniques for sparsification, while simpler heuristics relying solely on distance perform poorly.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem. Adaptive sparsification techniques using both mean and median can enhance performance. Regularly review and refine thresholds or weights to improve robustness.
