- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls of ineffective reflection (of which there are none explicitly stated in the prompt, so we will use general understanding of ineffective heuristics).

Here's the redefined framework:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Iterative, Normalized, Evaluative, Connectivity Priors, Sparsification.
*   **Advice:** Systematically combine problem-relevant factors using adaptive methods, normalizing for stability. Start simple, add complexity incrementally, and *quantitatively* evaluate each change.
*   **Avoid:** Vague goals (e.g., "improve robustness"), Untested assumptions, Premature optimization, ignoring edge cases.
*   **Explanation:** Go beyond simple combinations to understand *how* and *why* specific features and techniques improve performance. Focus on measurable improvements through rigorous testing.
