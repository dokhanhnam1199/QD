- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics.

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Incremental, Evaluation, Normalization, Baselines.
*   **Advice:** Start with a simple, robust baseline. Systematically integrate factors (distance, demand, location, etc.) using adaptive weighting and sparsification techniques. Rigorously evaluate each addition against the baseline.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity. Avoid ad-hoc adjustments without performance measurement.
*   **Explanation:** Incremental refinement grounded in empirical evaluation ensures informed heuristic design. Baselines provide a vital reference point for gauging improvement.
