**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see a significant difference in complexity and consideration of problem-specific constraints. The best heuristic incorporates distance, demand, spatial proximity, depot connections, connectivity, angle considerations, and adaptive sparsification, while the worst only considers distance.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the observation is similar to (1st) vs (20th).

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the adaptive sparsification threshold calculation in the 1st is more aggressive than the 2nd's and depot boost is stronger. Both heuristics include similar features but have slightly different weights and thresholds.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these are identical.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both only consider distance.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th), the demand penalty is different: 6th consider routes using more capacity, but not exceeding it; and spatial proximity is reduced if high demand.

Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors beyond just distance, including demand, location, connectivity, and depot proximity. Adaptive sparsification is a common element in the better-performing heuristics. The weighting and tuning of the various factors play a crucial role in the performance of the heuristic. More advanced heuristics incorporate angle considerations and adjust weights based on demand.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics for the CVRP require a multifaceted approach, considering not only distance but also demand, location, connectivity, and depot proximity. Adaptive sparsification helps to refine the search space. Carefully tuning the weights of different factors and dynamically adjusting parameters based on problem characteristics are crucial for good performance.
