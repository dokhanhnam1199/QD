- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing CVRP heuristics. We'll focus on actionable insights and avoid vague generalities.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Algorithmic bias, performance metrics, search space exploration, parameter tuning, benchmark datasets.
*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of individual factors (distance, demand, location) on heuristic performance. Use A/B testing with rigorous statistical analysis to identify significant improvements.
*   **Avoid:** Vague statements like "incorporate diverse factors" or "experiment with different weighting strategies" without clear metrics or experimentation plans.
*   **Explanation:** Move from intuition-based design to data-driven optimization. Focus on measurable improvements in solution quality and computational efficiency across a range of benchmark instances.
