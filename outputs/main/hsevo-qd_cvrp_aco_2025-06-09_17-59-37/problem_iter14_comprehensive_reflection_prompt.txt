{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for the CVRP require a multifaceted approach, considering not only distance but also demand, location, connectivity, and depot proximity. Adaptive sparsification helps to refine the search space. Carefully tuning the weights of different factors and dynamically adjusting parameters based on problem characteristics are crucial for good performance.\nWhen designing CVRP heuristics, prioritize incorporating diverse factors like distance, demand, and location for more effective edge selection. Experiment with different weighting strategies for these factors to fine-tune performance. Normalizing heuristics can also improve stability and comparison across different problem instances.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors (distance, demand, location) with adaptive techniques like sparsification and connectivity priors. Normalization is also a good practice. Start with a strong base heuristic and incrementally add complexity, evaluating the impact of each addition.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem. Adaptive sparsification techniques using both mean and median can enhance performance. Regularly review and refine thresholds or weights to improve robustness.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and how they interact. Start with a baseline heuristic (e.g., distance) and iteratively add factors, carefully evaluating the impact of each addition. Sparsification can be useful, but the aggressiveness needs to be tuned.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
