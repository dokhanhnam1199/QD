**Analysis:**
Comparing 1st vs 20th, we see that the first heuristic prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size, while the 20th heuristic favors bins with the most remaining capacity but also considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. 
Comparing 2nd vs 19th, we see that the second heuristic favors bins that have just enough capacity to accommodate the item and bins with less remaining capacity, while the 19th heuristic favors bins with the most remaining capacity relative to the item size. 
Comparing 3rd vs 18th, we see that the third heuristic prioritizes bins that can exactly fit the item and gives lower priority to bins that cannot hold the item, while the 18th heuristic favors bins with the most available capacity, normalizing the remaining capacity. 
Overall: Better heuristics consider multiple factors such as remaining capacity, item size, and bin utilization, while worse heuristics focus on a single aspect.

**Experience:**
Prioritize multiple factors and balance competing objectives for effective heuristics design.
