Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines remaining capacity and item size considerations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size\n    diff = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Create a mask where the item can fit into the bin\n    can_fit = diff >= zero_threshold\n    \n    # Set the priority to 0 for bins that cannot accommodate the item\n    priorities = np.where(can_fit, diff, zero_threshold)\n    \n    # Calculate the normalized remaining capacities\n    normalized_caps = bins_remain_cap / np.sum(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    # Calculate the final priorities, combining remaining capacity and item size considerations\n    # Higher priorities for bins with just enough capacity and higher normalized capacities\n    priorities = np.where(can_fit, \n                          1 / (1 + np.abs(priorities)) * normalized_caps, \n                          np.zeros_like(normalized_caps))\n    \n    # Subtract a large value from the priorities of bins that are more than half full\n    priorities = np.where(can_fit & (bins_remain_cap / (item + bins_remain_cap) > half_full_threshold), \n                          priorities - large_value, \n                          priorities)\n    \n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Balances remaining capacity, exact fit, and item size.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate how much space would be left in each bin if the item is added\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Give a high priority to bins where the item fills them exactly\n    exact_fit = np.where(remaining_space == 0, 1.0, 0.0)\n    \n    # Calculate the normalized remaining capacities\n    normalized_caps = bins_remain_cap / np.sum(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    # Give a moderate priority to bins where the item would leave some space\n    # and consider the normalized remaining capacities\n    partial_fit = np.where(remaining_space > 0, 0.5 * normalized_caps, 0.0)\n    \n    # Avoid using bins that are too small\n    invalid_bins = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -1.0, 0.0)\n    \n    # Calculate the priority as a weighted sum\n    priorities = 2.0 * exact_fit + partial_fit + invalid_bins\n    \n    # Ensure invalid bins have a lower priority than others\n    priorities = np.where(priorities < 0, -1.0, priorities)\n    \n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the 1st vs the 20th heuristics, we see that the 1st heuristic uses a more complex formula to calculate the priority score, taking into account the ratio of remaining capacity to item size, the absolute difference between remaining capacity and item size, and a penalty term for nearly full bins. In contrast, the 20th heuristic uses a simpler approach, prioritizing bins based on exact fit, partial fit, and invalid bins. Similarly, comparing the 2nd vs the 19th heuristics, we see that the 2nd heuristic uses a more straightforward calculation of priority score based on the inverse of the difference between remaining capacity and item size, while the 19th heuristic uses a weighted sum of exact fit, partial fit, and invalid bins. Comparing the 3rd vs the 18th heuristics, we see that the 3rd heuristic introduces additional complexity with a mask for bins that can fit the item and a penalty term for bins that are more than half full, whereas the 18th heuristic follows a similar approach to the 20th. Overall, the better heuristics tend to use more nuanced calculations and consider multiple factors when determining priority scores.\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current self-reflection':\n* **Keywords**: Trade-offs, optimization, simplicity, complexity\n* **Advice**: Analyze specific problem domains to tailor heuristics\n* **Avoid**: Overgeneralizing, prioritizing multiple factors without context\n* **Explanation**: Focus on understanding the unique characteristics of each problem to design effective heuristics, rather than relying on generic approaches.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
