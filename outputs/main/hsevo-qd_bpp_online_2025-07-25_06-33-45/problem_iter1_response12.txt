    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to pack items into bins such that the remaining space in each bin is minimized.
    It calculates the priority score for each bin based on the remaining capacity and the item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
