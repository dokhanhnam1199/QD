### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to favor bins that have just enough capacity to accommodate the item,
    and bins with less remaining capacity are prioritized to maximize the utilization of each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size
    diff = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Create a mask where the item can fit into the bin
    can_fit = diff >= 0
    
    # Set the priority to 0 for bins that cannot accommodate the item
    priorities = np.where(can_fit, diff, 0)
    
    # Subtract a large value from the priorities of bins that are more than half full
    priorities = np.where(can_fit & (bins_remain_cap / (item + bins_remain_cap) > 0.5), priorities - 1000, priorities)
    
    # Calculate the final priorities
    priorities = 1 / (1 + np.abs(priorities))
    
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function favors bins that have the most available capacity, 
    normalizing the remaining capacity to emphasize large remaining capacities.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the normalized remaining capacities
    normalized_caps = bins_remain_cap / np.sum(bins_remain_cap)
    
    # Avoid division by zero when item size is zero
    if item == 0:
        return normalized_caps
    
    # Calculate the priorities based on the remaining capacities and item size
    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, normalized_caps, np.zeros_like(normalized_caps))
    
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing 1st vs 20th, we see that the first heuristic prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size, while the 20th heuristic favors bins with the most remaining capacity but also considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. 
Comparing 2nd vs 19th, we see that the second heuristic favors bins that have just enough capacity to accommodate the item and bins with less remaining capacity, while the 19th heuristic favors bins with the most remaining capacity relative to the item size. 
Comparing 3rd vs 18th, we see that the third heuristic prioritizes bins that can exactly fit the item and gives lower priority to bins that cannot hold the item, while the 18th heuristic favors bins with the most available capacity, normalizing the remaining capacity. 
Overall: Better heuristics consider multiple factors such as remaining capacity, item size, and bin utilization, while worse heuristics focus on a single aspect.
- 
Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection':
* **Keywords**: Balance, Prioritization, Objective
* **Advice**: Identify key factors, weigh their importance, and adjust heuristics accordingly
* **Avoid**: Overemphasis on single objectives, neglect of trade-offs
* **Explanation**: Effective heuristics require balancing competing objectives, considering multiple factors to achieve optimal outcomes, and avoiding pitfalls of overly narrow focus.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size.
    If a bin has a remaining capacity that is closest to the item size, it gets the highest priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # calculate the absolute difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size
    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
    
    # calculate the priority score as the inverse of the difference
    priority_score = 1 / (diff + 1e-9)  # add a small value to avoid division by zero
    
    return priority_score

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection':
* **Keywords**: Balance, Prioritization, Objective
* **Advice**: Identify key factors, weigh their importance, and adjust heuristics accordingly
* **Avoid**: Overemphasis on single objectives, neglect of trade-offs
* **Explanation**: Effective heuristics require balancing competing objectives, considering multiple factors to achieve optimal outcomes, and avoiding pitfalls of overly narrow focus.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
