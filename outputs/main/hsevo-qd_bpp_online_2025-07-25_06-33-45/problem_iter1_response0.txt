    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size.
    If a bin has a remaining capacity that is closest to the item size, it gets the highest priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # calculate the priority score as the inverse of the difference
    priority_score = 1 / (diff + 1e-9)  # add a small value to avoid division by zero
