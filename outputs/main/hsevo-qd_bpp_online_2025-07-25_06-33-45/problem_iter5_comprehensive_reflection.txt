Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection':
* **Keywords**: Trade-offs, optimization, simplicity, complexity
* **Advice**: Analyze specific problem domains to tailor heuristics
* **Avoid**: Overgeneralizing, prioritizing multiple factors without context
* **Explanation**: Focus on understanding the unique characteristics of each problem to design effective heuristics, rather than relying on generic approaches.
