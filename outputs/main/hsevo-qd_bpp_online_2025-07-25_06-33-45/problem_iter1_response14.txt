Here is a new attempt at implementing a priority function for the Online Bin Packing Problem (BPP):

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the following rules:
    1. The bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can still fit the item is prioritized.
    2. If multiple bins have the same smallest remaining capacity, the one that is currently most empty (i.e., has the most remaining capacity relative to its size) is prioritized.
    3. If the item cannot fit in any bin, the priority is set to 0 for all bins.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Filter out bins that the item cannot fit in
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # If no bin can fit the item, set all priorities to 0
    if not np.any(valid_bins):
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    # Calculate the priority for each valid bin
    priorities = np.where(valid_bins, 1 / (bins_remain_cap - item), 0)

    return priorities
```

This priority function uses a simple heuristic: it calculates the priority of each valid bin as the inverse of the remaining capacity after the item is added. This means that the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can still fit the item will have the highest priority, and the bin that is currently most empty will have a higher priority if multiple bins have the same smallest remaining capacity. If the item cannot fit in any bin, the priority is set to 0 for all bins.
