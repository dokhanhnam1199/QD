**Analysis:**
Comparing the 1st vs the 20th heuristics, we see that the 1st heuristic uses a more complex formula to calculate the priority score, taking into account the ratio of remaining capacity to item size, the absolute difference between remaining capacity and item size, and a penalty term for nearly full bins. In contrast, the 20th heuristic uses a simpler approach, prioritizing bins based on exact fit, partial fit, and invalid bins. Similarly, comparing the 2nd vs the 19th heuristics, we see that the 2nd heuristic uses a more straightforward calculation of priority score based on the inverse of the difference between remaining capacity and item size, while the 19th heuristic uses a weighted sum of exact fit, partial fit, and invalid bins. Comparing the 3rd vs the 18th heuristics, we see that the 3rd heuristic introduces additional complexity with a mask for bins that can fit the item and a penalty term for bins that are more than half full, whereas the 18th heuristic follows a similar approach to the 20th. Overall, the better heuristics tend to use more nuanced calculations and consider multiple factors when determining priority scores.

**Experience:**
Simpler and more complex heuristics have trade-offs; consider multiple factors for better optimization.
