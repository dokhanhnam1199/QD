[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` prioritizes bins with the smallest non-negative slack (i.e., `bins_remain_cap - item`). This is a good interpretation of "Almost Full Fit". However, it might sometimes be beneficial to also consider the "fullness" of the bin *before* placing the item. Bins that are already quite full might be better candidates than very empty bins, even if they both offer a similar "tight fit". This can help consolidate items into fewer bins.

We can achieve this by slightly penalizing bins that are very empty. A simple way to do this is to subtract a value related to the *original* remaining capacity from the priority score, but in a way that doesn't override the primary "almost full" criterion for bins that fit.

Alternatively, we can directly reward bins that are "closer" to fitting the item. The current inverse slack approach does this. Let's consider a slight modification to balance "tight fit" with "not too empty".

Consider the potential remaining capacity after placing the item (`potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item`). For bins that fit, we want `potential_remaining_cap` to be small and non-negative.
A score like `1 / (1 + slack)` works well for this.

To introduce the idea of "not too empty" *before* insertion, we could consider the original `bins_remain_cap`. Bins that are very large might be less desirable even if they offer a tight fit for the current item, as they might be better suited for larger items later.

Let's try to combine the "tight fit" (small `slack`) with a preference for bins that are not excessively large.
We can modify the priority calculation for fitting bins. Instead of just `1.0 / (1.0 + slack)`, we could use a function that decreases as `slack` increases, but also decreases as `bins_remain_cap` (before insertion) increases.

A simple heuristic: maximize `(1.0 / (1.0 + slack))` and perhaps penalize very large original capacities.
However, directly penalizing large capacities might conflict with the "almost full" goal if a large bin becomes "almost full" for a specific item.

Let's refine `priority_v1` to better reflect the idea of prioritizing minimal remaining capacity *while also* considering the original fullness. We want bins that are "tight fits" *and* are not excessively large.

A possible score could be: `(1 / (1 + slack)) * (1 / (1 + original_capacity_factor))`
The `original_capacity_factor` should be small for small capacities and large for large capacities.
For example, `bins_remain_cap` itself could be used, but we need to scale it appropriately so it doesn't dominate the `slack` term.

Let's re-evaluate the goal: "Prioritize minimal remaining capacity ('tight fits'). Balance this with bin fullness and explore slightly larger gaps for robustness. Avoid overly complex combinations."

The current `1 / (1 + slack)` prioritizes minimal remaining capacity (tight fits).
"Balance this with bin fullness": This suggests preferring bins that are already somewhat full.
"explore slightly larger gaps for robustness": This means don't *only* pick the absolute tightest fit if other good fits exist.

Let's consider the potential remaining capacity (`potential_remaining_cap`).
For bins that fit, we want `potential_remaining_cap` to be small.
If we use `-potential_remaining_cap` as a score, bins that end up with `0.1` remaining get a score of `-0.1`, while bins ending with `1.0` remaining get a score of `-1.0`. This prioritizes the `0.1` remaining bin, which is correct.

To incorporate "bin fullness" and "slightly larger gaps":
We can try to give a boost to bins that have a reasonable amount of remaining capacity but are still the tightest.
A strategy could be:
1. Identify bins that can fit the item.
2. For these bins, calculate a score that is high when `bins_remain_cap - item` is small.
3. Also, give a slight preference to bins that are not excessively empty, and maybe a slight penalty to bins that are *too* full (already have very little capacity left even before adding the item). This is tricky.

Let's consider the current strategy `1 / (1 + slack)`. This heavily favors slack 0, then slack 1, etc.
To balance with bin fullness, we can consider `bins_remain_cap`.
If we want to prefer bins that are not excessively large *and* are tight fits:
Score = `(1 / (1 + slack)) * f(bins_remain_cap)` where `f` is some function that is higher for moderately full bins.

A simpler approach to "balance with bin fullness":
Consider `bins_remain_cap - item`. We want this to be small.
We could also add a term related to the inverse of the *original* remaining capacity, but only if it's not too small.
This becomes complex quickly.

Let's try a different perspective: maximize the "goodness" of a fit.
Goodness could be defined as:
- High priority for small slack (`bins_remain_cap - item`).
- Moderate priority for the original `bins_remain_cap`.

Consider the negative remaining capacity after insertion: `-potential_remaining_cap`.
This rewards being close to zero.
Let's scale this by the original capacity in some way.

What if we use a combination of the slack and the original capacity?
Priority for fitting bins: `score = (1 / (1 + slack)) * (some_function_of_original_capacity)`
Or, let's try to reward bins that, after adding the item, are "more full" in a relative sense.
`potential_remaining_cap` is absolute.

Consider the term `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` as a base priority (higher means better fit).
To balance with fullness, we could add a term that is negative for very large original capacities.
Let's try adding a term that is `-(bins_remain_cap)` or `-log(bins_remain_cap)` to the priority, to penalize large bins. However, this must be done carefully to not override the primary objective of fitting.

A simpler modification to `priority_v1`:
Keep the `1 / (1 + slack)` part, which prioritizes tight fits.
Add a small penalty for bins that are extremely large, to encourage using moderately sized bins if they offer a similar fit.
This is hard to do without making the heuristic overly complex.

Let's reconsider the reflection: "Prioritize minimal remaining capacity ('tight fits'). Balance this with bin fullness and explore slightly larger gaps for robustness."

The current `1 / (1 + slack)` focuses on tight fits.
To balance with bin fullness, we can simply ensure that the score doesn't become excessively high for bins that are already very full.

Let's try a score that captures both:
1.  Minimize `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`.
2.  Slightly prefer bins that aren't "too empty" originally.
3.  Slightly prefer bins that aren't "too full" originally (to leave space for potential future items, or to avoid over-commitment).

This points towards picking bins that are "moderately full" and offer a tight fit.
This is often approximated by strategies like "First Fit Decreasing" or by modifying First Fit/Best Fit.

For an online scenario, a simple modification could be:
Priority = `(1 / (1 + slack))` but capped or scaled.

Let's focus on "balance with bin fullness". This means bins that are already quite full should get a boost compared to very empty bins, assuming they offer a similar tight fit.

Consider the "Best Fit" strategy: pick the bin with the minimum `bins_remain_cap >= item`. This is similar to minimizing slack.
The "Almost Full Fit" is about minimizing `bins_remain_cap - item`.

Let's try a score where we directly reward small `bins_remain_cap - item`, and also add a term that is higher for bins that are not excessively large.
For fitting bins:
`priority = (MAX_SLACK - slack) + (MAX_CAP - bins_remain_cap)`
This would prioritize bins with small slack AND small original capacity.
We need `MAX_SLACK` and `MAX_CAP` to be determined dynamically or set as constants.

Let's stick to a simpler modification of `priority_v1`.
The core idea is that `1 / (1 + slack)` is good for tight fits.
To balance with bin fullness, let's consider the *original* remaining capacity.
If `bins_remain_cap` is very small (even before adding the item), it might be a less desirable bin even if it's a tight fit, as it's already almost full.
If `bins_remain_cap` is very large, it might also be less desirable than a moderately full bin.

Let's aim for a score that rewards small slack, and among those with similar slack, prefers bins that are not excessively large.
We can achieve this by using `1 / (1 + slack)` and then slightly adjusting based on `bins_remain_cap`.
A simple adjustment: subtract a small fraction of `bins_remain_cap`.
`priority = (1 / (1 + slack)) - C * bins_remain_cap`
Here `C` is a small constant.
This would penalize larger original bins.

Let's refine this. We want to prioritize minimal remaining capacity, then use bin fullness as a tie-breaker or secondary factor.
The `1 / (1 + slack)` already gives higher scores to smaller slacks.
If two bins have the same slack, their priority will be the same.
To break ties: pick the one that is "more full" (smaller original `bins_remain_cap`) or "less full" (larger original `bins_remain_cap`)?
"Balance this with bin fullness" could mean we prefer bins that are already moderately full.

Let's try to define the score such that it prioritizes small `slack`, but then uses `bins_remain_cap` to differentiate.
Score = `1.0 / (1.0 + slack + penalty_for_large_bins)`
The penalty for large bins should only apply if the slack is similar.

A robust heuristic: maximize `f(slack, original_capacity)`.
Let's try a score that rewards small `slack` and moderate `original_capacity`.
A function like `1.0 / (1.0 + slack)` is good for slack.
To balance with bin fullness, we can multiply by a term that is higher for moderate capacities.
This is getting complicated.

Let's go with a direct approach: Prioritize bins that are tight fits, and among them, prefer bins that are not excessively large.
The primary sorting key is `slack` (ascending).
The secondary sorting key could be `bins_remain_cap` (ascending, to prefer smaller bins).

So, we want to construct a score where smaller slack gives a higher score, and for equal slack, smaller `bins_remain_cap` gives a higher score.

Score = `f(slack) + g(bins_remain_cap)`
We want `f` to decrease with slack.
We want `g` to decrease with `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try: `score = 1.0 / (1.0 + slack) - constant * bins_remain_cap`.
This makes larger bins have lower scores.

Consider the requirements:
1. Minimal remaining capacity ('tight fits'): `1.0 / (1.0 + slack)` handles this well.
2. Balance with bin fullness: This is the tricky part. If a large bin offers a tight fit, should it be preferred over a smaller bin with a slightly less tight fit?
   "Balance" suggests not to completely ignore fullness.

Let's try a score that sums the negative slack and a term related to the negative original capacity.
For fitting bins:
`priority = -(slack) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`
Here `alpha` is a small weighting factor.
This would prioritize bins with smaller slack. If slacks are equal, it would pick the one with smaller `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try a different approach:
Focus on `potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want this to be small and non-negative.
Priority = `-(potential_remaining_cap)`: This prioritizes bins that become most full.
Let's add a term that penalizes very large original bins:
Priority = `-(potential_remaining_cap) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`

This could also be expressed as maximizing `alpha * bins_remain_cap - (bins_remain_cap - item)` for fitting bins.
Which is `alpha * bins_remain_cap - bins_remain_cap + item`
= `(alpha - 1) * bins_remain_cap + item`.
If `alpha < 1`, this penalizes larger bins.

Let's test `priority = -(slack) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`.
If `bins_remain_cap = 5, item = 3` -> `slack = 2`, `priority = -2 - alpha * 5`
If `bins_remain_cap = 4, item = 3` -> `slack = 1`, `priority = -1 - alpha * 4`
If `bins_remain_cap = 3, item = 3` -> `slack = 0`, `priority = 0 - alpha * 3`

Comparing slack=1 vs slack=0:
`-1 - alpha * 4` vs `0 - alpha * 3`
We want the slack=0 bin to be preferred.
`-1 - 4*alpha < -3*alpha`
`-1 < alpha`
This is true for positive alpha.

Comparing slack=2 vs slack=1:
`-2 - alpha * 5` vs `-1 - alpha * 4`
We want the slack=1 bin to be preferred.
`-2 - 5*alpha < -1 - 4*alpha`
`-1 < alpha`
This is also true for positive alpha.

This means this scoring function `-(slack) - alpha * bins_remain_cap` correctly prioritizes smaller slacks, and for equal slacks, it picks smaller original capacities. This seems to align with the reflection.

We need to choose `alpha`. A small `alpha` would make the slack dominate. A larger `alpha` would give more weight to bin size. Let's pick a small value, e.g., `0.1`.
The resulting scores will be negative. We want the highest score, so we want the least negative value.

The previous `priority_v1` returned positive values for priority, assuming higher is better. Let's maintain that convention.
To convert `-(slack) - alpha * bins_remain_cap` to positive priorities where higher is better:
We can invert it or add a large constant.
Let's use `1.0 / (1.0 + slack)` and augment it.

Consider: `score = 1.0 / (1.0 + slack)`
This gives:
Slack 0: 1.0
Slack 1: 0.5
Slack 2: 0.33

Let's try to penalize large original bins by subtracting a scaled version of them from this score.
`priority = (1.0 / (1.0 + slack)) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`
If `bins_remain_cap = 5, item = 3` -> `slack = 2`, `priority = 0.33 - alpha * 5`
If `bins_remain_cap = 4, item = 3` -> `slack = 1`, `priority = 0.5 - alpha * 4`
If `bins_remain_cap = 3, item = 3` -> `slack = 0`, `priority = 1.0 - alpha * 3`

Comparing slack=1 vs slack=0:
`0.5 - alpha * 4` vs `1.0 - alpha * 3`
We want slack=0 to be higher priority.
`1.0 - alpha * 3 > 0.5 - alpha * 4`
`0.5 > -alpha` which is true for positive alpha.

Comparing slack=2 vs slack=1:
`0.33 - alpha * 5` vs `0.5 - alpha * 4`
We want slack=1 to be higher priority.
`0.5 - alpha * 4 > 0.33 - alpha * 5`
`0.17 > -alpha` which is true for positive alpha.

This function `(1.0 / (1.0 + slack)) - alpha * bins_remain_cap` seems to prioritize tight fits and then prefer smaller bins. This aligns with "balance this with bin fullness" by preferring smaller bins as a secondary criterion when fits are similar.

Let's choose a small `alpha`, like `0.05`. This gives a moderate penalty to larger bins.

We should also ensure that only bins that can actually fit the item receive a positive priority.
The `fit_mask` correctly identifies these.
