Prioritize tight fits, balance with bin fullness, and consider exploration strategies.
Prioritize minimal slack first, then favor fuller bins by inverting remaining capacity.
Favor tight fits, but explore slightly larger gaps for flexibility.
Focus on the core objective (minimal waste) for better heuristics. Explore complex combinations cautiously.
Focus on tighter fits, penalize large remaining capacities, and explore solutions.
Prioritize minimizing remaining capacity for tight fits, then consider initial bin fullness.
Prioritize minimal waste, add slight random noise for exploration.
Focus on minimizing remaining capacity for "fuller" bins, then best fit.
Prioritize minimal waste, then favor fuller bins by combining inverse slack and inverse capacity.
Prioritize tight fits by minimizing remaining capacity after packing, and consider bin fullness.
