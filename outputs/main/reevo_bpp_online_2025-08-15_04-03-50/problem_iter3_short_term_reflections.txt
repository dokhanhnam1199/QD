Prioritize fuller bins by inverting remaining capacity for better fit.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing. Maximize fitting bins' inverse slack.
Focus on precisely defining the "almost full" metric and its relationship to priority.
Prioritize fuller bins that fit the item.
Prioritize bins that fit, then consider tightness for better packing.
Prioritize fuller bins for better packing density. Experiment with different priority calculations.
Randomness for exploration is good, but don't over-prioritize it without considering item-bin fit.
Prioritize minimal waste for Best Fit; maximize remaining capacity for Worst Fit.
Prioritize "tight fits" for better space utilization and future item packing.
Explore diverse strategies; blend greedy choices with random exploration for robustness.
