[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` function implements an "Almost Full Fit" strategy by prioritizing bins with minimal non-negative slack. While this is a good starting point, the reflection suggests a balance: "Prioritize minimal remaining capacity ('tight fits'). Balance this with bin fullness and explore slightly larger gaps for robustness." The current `1.0 / (1.0 + slack)` gives highest priority to perfect fits (slack=0) and then rapidly decreases priority as slack increases. This might be too sensitive to slight overestimation of item size or bin capacity.

To balance tightness with robustness, we can consider a function that is less aggressive in penalizing slightly larger gaps. Instead of `1/(1+x)`, we could use something like `1/(1 + x^p)` for `p > 1` to emphasize smaller gaps more, or a piecewise function. Another approach is to directly consider the `potential_remaining_cap`. Maximizing `-potential_remaining_cap` (which means minimizing `potential_remaining_cap`) directly reflects packing as tightly as possible.

Let's try a strategy that combines a penalty for slack with a bonus for bins that become "more full". We want to prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and non-negative. A simple way to achieve this is to use the negative of the `potential_remaining_cap` as a base priority, but this might favor bins that are very large initially and still have large capacity left, even if they are 'tight fits' for the current item in a relative sense.

A more robust approach for "Almost Full Fit" that balances tightness and avoiding too-small gaps could be:
1. Identify bins where the item fits (`bins_remain_cap >= item`).
2. For these fitting bins, calculate the `potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item`.
3. We want to prioritize bins with the smallest `potential_remaining_cap`. So, a higher priority means smaller `potential_remaining_cap`.
4. A linear inverse relationship like `-(potential_remaining_cap)` is problematic if `potential_remaining_cap` can be large positive or negative.
5. A better approach is to consider the "degree of fullness" after insertion. The smaller `potential_remaining_cap` is, the more full the bin.
6. We can prioritize bins that result in the smallest positive `potential_remaining_cap`.
7. To balance with "slightly larger gaps for robustness," we can introduce a factor that slightly reduces priority for bins that are *too* full (i.e., very small `potential_remaining_cap`), or we can simply use a function that penalizes larger remaining capacities less severely than `1/(1+x)`.

Let's consider a different function for priority that is still increasing as `potential_remaining_cap` decreases, but less steeply for larger values. The goal is to pick a bin that is "almost full" after packing. This means `potential_remaining_cap` should be small.

Consider a function that is proportional to `1 / (epsilon + potential_remaining_cap)` for fitting bins, where `epsilon` is a small positive number to avoid division by zero. This would assign high priority to bins with small positive `potential_remaining_cap`.

Let's try a strategy that aims to minimize `potential_remaining_cap` directly, but perhaps with a smoother penalty for larger capacities.
A common technique in heuristic design is to use a function of the gap. We want to minimize the gap (`bins_remain_cap - item`).

How about: `priority = 1.0 / (some_large_number + (bins_remain_cap - item))` for fitting bins. This prioritizes smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
Or, `priority = exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` for fitting bins, where `k` is a positive constant. This gives higher priority to smaller non-negative remaining capacities. A larger `k` would make it more sensitive to small gaps.

Let's try a combination: prioritize bins that fit, and among those, prefer those with less remaining capacity. The intuition is to use bins efficiently.
If `bins_remain_cap - item` is the remaining capacity, we want to minimize this.
So, `priority = - (bins_remain_cap - item)` for fitting bins? This would select the bin that becomes most full.
However, this doesn't account for the "slightly larger gaps for robustness."

A strategy that balances "tight fit" with "robustness" might involve a score that is high for small non-negative gaps, but doesn't drop off too sharply for slightly larger gaps compared to `1/(1+x)`.
Let's reconsider prioritizing `potential_remaining_cap`. We want to minimize it.
A score that is `large_value - potential_remaining_cap` would work, but we need to bound it and handle non-fitting bins.

Let's try to map `potential_remaining_cap` to a priority score such that smaller values get higher scores.
A simple transformation is `1.0 / (1.0 + potential_remaining_cap)` only if `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`. This is what `priority_v1` does.

Let's try to use the negative of the remaining capacity but scaled, and ensure robustness.
What if we consider the original capacity too?
`priority = -potential_remaining_cap + alpha * bins_remain_cap` ? This is getting complicated.

Back to basics: "Prioritize minimal remaining capacity". This means we want `potential_remaining_cap` to be as small as possible.
So, we want to MAXIMIZE `-potential_remaining_cap` for bins that fit.
Let's test this idea:
Bin A: bins_remain_cap=5, item=3 => potential_remaining_cap=2, priority = -2
Bin B: bins_remain_cap=4, item=3 => potential_remaining_cap=1, priority = -1
Bin C: bins_remain_cap=3, item=3 => potential_remaining_cap=0, priority = 0
Bin D: bins_remain_cap=2, item=3 => does not fit, priority = 0 (or -inf)
Bin E: bins_remain_cap=6, item=3 => potential_remaining_cap=3, priority = -3

In this scheme, Bin C (perfect fit) gets the highest priority. This aligns with "tight fits".
How to incorporate "explore slightly larger gaps for robustness"?
This implies that maybe a bin with `potential_remaining_cap=1` shouldn't be *that* much worse than `potential_remaining_cap=0`.
The current `1/(1+slack)` does this: slack=0 -> 1.0, slack=1 -> 0.5. The drop is significant.

Let's try a function that is more linear or has a slower decay for larger slacks.
Consider `priority = max(0, MaxPossibleSlack - slack)` where `MaxPossibleSlack` is the max slack among fitting bins. This prioritizes smaller slacks but linearly.
Or `priority = max(0, some_constant - slack)`.

Let's stick to prioritizing minimum `potential_remaining_cap` for fitting bins.
`priority = -potential_remaining_cap`.
To make it "robust" and less aggressive on small slacks, we can normalize this or add a small constant.
What if we use `priority = -potential_remaining_cap + C` where `C` is large enough so that priorities are positive?
`priority = C - (bins_remain_cap - item)`.
Let `C = max(bins_remain_cap)` (the original bin capacity, say `B`).
So, `priority = B - (bins_remain_cap - item)`.
If item fits, `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
Bin A: `B=10, bins_remain_cap=5, item=3` => `potential_remaining_cap=2`. Priority = `10 - 2 = 8`.
Bin B: `B=10, bins_remain_cap=4, item=3` => `potential_remaining_cap=1`. Priority = `10 - 1 = 9`.
Bin C: `B=10, bins_remain_cap=3, item=3` => `potential_remaining_cap=0`. Priority = `10 - 0 = 10`.
Bin D: `B=10, bins_remain_cap=2, item=3` => does not fit. Priority = `0`.
Bin E: `B=10, bins_remain_cap=6, item=3` => `potential_remaining_cap=3`. Priority = `10 - 3 = 7`.

This strategy `B - potential_remaining_cap` prioritizes bins that end up with less remaining capacity.
It implicitly favors bins that were initially fuller but can still fit the item, as they will have smaller `potential_remaining_cap`.
This seems to capture the "tight fit" aspect well.
For robustness against slight variations, this linear relationship might be better than the exponential decay of `1/(1+x)`.
It also ensures that bins that fit are strictly preferred over those that don't (since priorities are non-negative if `B >= potential_remaining_cap`, which is always true if the item fits and `B` is the original bin capacity).

Let's refine this: we need the *original bin capacity* to compute this. The function only receives `bins_remain_cap`. This implies the heuristic itself should not depend on the original full capacity of bins unless it's passed in.

Okay, let's reconsider the original goal: prioritize minimal remaining capacity.
This implies `potential_remaining_cap` should be small.
What if we use `1.0 / (epsilon + potential_remaining_cap)` again, but ensure `epsilon` is chosen carefully?
Or, we can simply use `-(potential_remaining_cap)` as a score, but to ensure positive scores, we can add a large offset.
Let `offset = max(potential_remaining_cap)` over all bins where it fits.
Then priority is `offset - potential_remaining_cap` for fitting bins.

Let's simplify. The primary goal is "tight fit", which means minimize `potential_remaining_cap`.
So, we want to maximize `-(potential_remaining_cap)` for valid bins.
To handle the "robustness" and "balance" part, let's avoid extremely sharp penalties.
A linear function of `potential_remaining_cap` might be good.
We want priority to decrease as `potential_remaining_cap` increases.
So, `priority = C - potential_remaining_cap` where `C` is a constant.
To ensure higher priority for smaller `potential_remaining_cap`, we want the coefficient of `potential_remaining_cap` to be negative.

Let's try a scoring function that awards points based on how close `bins_remain_cap` is to `item`.
We want `bins_remain_cap - item` to be small and non-negative.

Consider the set of `potential_remaining_cap` for bins that fit. Let this set be `P`.
We want to assign higher scores to smaller values in `P`.
A simple transformation is `max(P) - p` for each `p` in `P`. This gives highest score to the bin with smallest `potential_remaining_cap`.
This is essentially what the `B - potential_remaining_cap` idea was, but using `max(P)` as the constant.

Let's implement `max_possible_potential_remaining_cap - potential_remaining_cap` for fitting bins.

`potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item`
`fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item`
`fitting_potential_remaining_cap = potential_remaining_cap[fit_mask]`

If `fitting_potential_remaining_cap` is empty (item doesn't fit anywhere), return zeros.
Otherwise, `max_potential_rem_cap = np.max(fitting_potential_remaining_cap)`
`priorities[fit_mask] = max_potential_rem_cap - fitting_potential_remaining_cap`

Example:
`bins_remain_cap = [5, 4, 3, 2, 6]`, `item = 3`
`potential_remaining_cap = [2, 1, 0, -1, 3]`
`fit_mask = [True, True, True, False, True]`
`fitting_potential_remaining_cap = [2, 1, 0, 3]`
`max_potential_rem_cap = 3`

Priorities:
Bin 0 (cap 5): `3 - 2 = 1`
Bin 1 (cap 4): `3 - 1 = 2`
Bin 2 (cap 3): `3 - 0 = 3`
Bin 3 (cap 2): `0` (doesn't fit)
Bin 4 (cap 6): `3 - 3 = 0`

This prioritizes the tightest fit (Bin 2, remaining 0), then the next tightest (Bin 1, remaining 1), then others.
It also assigns 0 priority to bins that don't fit or are only "loosely fit" (Bin 4, remaining 3). This is good.

This strategy directly implements "Prioritize minimal remaining capacity" and provides a linear decay for slack, which could be considered a balance for robustness compared to `1/(1+x)`.

Let's consider the "slightly larger gaps for robustness". If `bins_remain_cap = [10, 9]` and `item=3`.
`potential_remaining_cap = [7, 6]`
`fit_mask = [True, True]`
`fitting_potential_remaining_cap = [7, 6]`
`max_potential_rem_cap = 7`
Bin 0: `7 - 7 = 0`
Bin 1: `7 - 6 = 1`
This prioritizes the slightly fuller bin (Bin 1).
This might not be what "robustness" implies. "Robustness" might mean not being *too* sensitive to small differences. Maybe we want a less steep decay.

What if we use `priority = 1.0 / (1.0 + slack^2)` or `1.0 / (1.0 + slack^alpha)` with `alpha > 1`?
This would penalize larger slacks even more than `1/(1+x)`. This is not what we want.

Let's think about the "balance" part again. "Balance this with bin fullness".
This could mean that if two bins have the same `potential_remaining_cap`, maybe we prefer the one that was originally fuller? But that information isn't available.

Let's stick to the interpretation of "balance" as a less aggressive penalty for larger slacks.
The `max_potential_rem_cap - potential_remaining_cap` approach gives a linear decrease.
`priority = C - slack`.
`priority_v1` used `1 / (1 + slack)`. This decays faster for larger slack.
`priority = C - slack` is probably a good balance.

Final check on the "robustness" and "balance":
The strategy `max_potential_rem_cap - potential_remaining_cap` for fitting bins emphasizes minimizing the remaining space. This directly addresses "tight fits." The linear nature of the penalty means that a gap of 2 is twice as bad as a gap of 1, which is less severe than the multiplicative penalty in `1/(1+x)` (where a gap of 2 is 3x worse than a gap of 1 in terms of priority value). This seems to fit the description.
It also ensures that only bins that can fit get positive priorities, and the best fit gets the maximum priority.

Let's call this `priority_v2`.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a balanced 'Almost Full Fit' strategy.

    aiming for robustness.

    max_potential_rem_cap = np.max(potential_remaining_cap_fitting)
