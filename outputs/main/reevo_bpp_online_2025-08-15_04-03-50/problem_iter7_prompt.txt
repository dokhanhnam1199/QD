A bin that fits the item should have a positive priority.\n    # The primary driver is minimizing the remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    # Therefore, bins with smaller `potential_remaining_cap` should have higher priority.\n    # So, we can use `-potential_remaining_cap` for bins that fit.\n\n    # To ensure that bins that *barely* fit (small slack) are preferred over bins\n    # that have a lot of extra space but could still fit the item, we can also consider\n    # the slack. A bin that has exactly `item` remaining capacity (slack = 0) is ideal.\n    # Bins with very small positive slack are also good candidates.\n\n    # Let's try a scoring mechanism:\n    # Score = (MaxPossibleSlack - Slack)\n    # where MaxPossibleSlack is the maximum slack among all bins that can fit the item.\n    # This would give higher scores to bins with less slack.\n    # If multiple bins have the same minimum slack, we can break ties by\n    # choosing the bin that has more remaining capacity overall (a slightly less full bin)\n    # to potentially save some very tight fits for later. This latter part is a bit counter-intuitive\n    # to pure \"almost full fit\" but can be a useful heuristic.\n\n    # A more direct interpretation of \"Almost Full Fit\" prioritizes bins that, after placing the item,\n    # have the smallest remaining capacity. So, we directly use the negative of the remaining capacity\n    # as a priority.\n\n    # If a bin can fit the item, its priority is the inverse of the remaining capacity after insertion.\n    # Lower remaining capacity (closer to zero) should yield a higher priority.\n    # So, we use `-potential_remaining_cap`.\n    # We only assign priorities to bins that can fit the item.\n    priorities[fit_mask] = -potential_remaining_cap[fit_mask]\n\n    # Optionally, to further refine for \"almost full\" and avoid very large bins being chosen\n    # if they happen to have a similar negative remaining capacity, we could also factor in\n    # the original remaining capacity or the \"slack\" (bins_remain_cap - item).\n    # For a pure \"almost full\" feeling, bins that will have capacity 0 or very close to 0 are best.\n\n    # A common way to implement \"Almost Full Fit\" is to prioritize bins\n    # that have the minimum remaining capacity *after* the item is placed,\n    # provided the item fits.\n    # So, we want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` for valid bins.\n\n    # To make it robust, we can ensure very large capacities that would fit don't get a high priority\n    # unless they become \"almost full\" relative to other bins.\n    # A simple approach that captures \"almost full\" is to use the remaining capacity as the priority value.\n    # However, this would prioritize bins that are *already* almost full and might not fit the item well.\n\n    # The prompt suggests \"the bin with the highest priority score will be selected\".\n    # So, if we want bins that become *most* full, we want the smallest `potential_remaining_cap`.\n    # This translates to maximizing `-potential_remaining_cap`.\n\n    # Let's reconsider the \"Almost Full Fit\" strategy's intent:\n    # \"Prioritize bins that will be 'almost full' after packing.\"\n    # This implies we want `potential_remaining_cap` to be small.\n    # If we use `potential_remaining_cap` directly, we'd pick the bin that ends up *most* empty (highest remaining capacity).\n    # If we use `-potential_remaining_cap`, we'd pick the bin that ends up *most* full (lowest remaining capacity).\n    # This seems to align with the goal.\n\n    # However, let's also consider what might happen if `potential_remaining_cap` is negative\n    # (i.e., item doesn't fit). These bins should have very low priority.\n    # Our `fit_mask` handles this by not assigning positive priorities.\n    # But what if multiple bins *can* fit the item, but one results in `-0.1` remaining\n    # and another results in `-5` remaining? The `-5` bin is more \"almost full\".\n\n    # A common way to interpret \"Almost Full Fit\" is to look at bins where\n    # `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and non-negative.\n    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative, the item doesn't fit, so priority is 0.\n    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is 0, it's a perfect fit.\n    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive, it's an \"almost full\" fit.\n    # We want to prioritize smaller non-negative `bins_remain_cap - item` values.\n    # So, we can assign priority as `1.0 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap - item))` for bins that fit,\n    # where `bins_remain_cap - item` is non-negative.\n    # This way, a slack of 0 gives a priority of 1.0, a slack of 1 gives 0.5, a slack of 10 gives ~0.09.\n    # This favors smaller slacks.\n\n    # Let's use a strategy that directly reflects \"almost full\".\n    # We want to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item` for valid bins.\n    # The priority should be inversely related to this value.\n    # Higher priority for smaller non-negative `bins_remain_cap - item`.\n\n    # Calculate slack for bins where the item fits\n    slack = bins_remain_cap[fit_mask] - item\n\n    # Assign priority: Higher priority for smaller slack (closer to 0).\n    # We add a small epsilon to avoid division by zero if slack is exactly 0,\n    # though `1 / (1 + slack)` naturally handles slack=0 as 1.\n    # The `1 +` in the denominator ensures we don't get infinite priority for perfect fits\n    # and also that priorities are positive and bounded.\n    # A bin with slack 0 gets priority 1.0.\n    # A bin with slack 1 gets priority 1/2 = 0.5.\n    # A bin with slack 10 gets priority 1/11 ~ 0.09.\n    priorities[fit_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + slack)\n\n    # To make it more \"almost full\" focused, we could slightly boost\n    # bins that have *very little* remaining capacity after insertion,\n    # even if that remaining capacity is negative (i.e., the item doesn't fit perfectly).\n    # However, the prompt is about selecting a bin for an item, so items that don't fit\n    # should naturally have no priority.\n    # The current implementation focuses on minimizing slack for fitting bins.\n\n    # An alternative interpretation of \"Almost Full Fit\":\n    # Prioritize bins that, after fitting the item, leave the *least* amount of remaining capacity.\n    # This means we want to maximize `-potential_remaining_cap`.\n    # Let's stick to the idea of prioritizing smaller non-negative slacks.\n\n    # Final Check:\n    # If item fits in bins A and B:\n    # Bin A: bins_remain_cap=5, item=3  => slack=2, priority = 1/(1+2) = 0.33\n    # Bin B: bins_remain_cap=4, item=3  => slack=1, priority = 1/(1+1) = 0.5\n    # Bin C: bins_remain_cap=3, item=3  => slack=0, priority = 1/(1+0) = 1.0\n    # Bin D: bins_remain_cap=2, item=3  => does not fit, priority = 0\n    # Bin E: bins_remain_cap=6, item=3  => slack=3, priority = 1/(1+3) = 0.25\n\n    # This heuristic favors bins that have minimal unused space after packing the item.\n    # This is a reasonable implementation of \"Almost Full Fit\".\n\n    return priorities\n\n[Improved code]\nPlease write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection.
