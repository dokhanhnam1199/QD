Focus on tight fits, penalize excessive slack for better packing.
Prioritize tight fits and fuller bins. Combine objectives carefully for desired impact.
Favor tight fits but smoothly explore slightly larger gaps.
Prioritize tight fits, then favor fuller bins. Avoid complex penalties; focus on simple scoring.
Prioritize tight fits, then fuller bins. Tune secondary score weight for balance.
Prioritize tight fits, avoid large gaps, and use exploration strategically.
Prioritize tight fits. Penalize excessively large bins. Balance packing efficiency with robustness.
Prioritize fullness, then best fit. Avoid noise for deterministic goals.
Favor tighter fits with a gentler decay for exploration.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize excessive capacity, and balance with robustness.
