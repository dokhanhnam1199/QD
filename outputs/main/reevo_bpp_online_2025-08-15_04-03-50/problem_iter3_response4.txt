[Prior reflection]
The previous `priority_v1` function uses `1.0 / (1.0 + slack)` which prioritizes bins with minimal *non-negative* slack. This is a good "tight fit" heuristic. However, the prompt mentions favoring "fuller bins" and "inverted slack". "Inverted slack" could mean `1/slack` or `-slack`. `1/slack` would heavily favor bins with very small slack, potentially leading to picking a bin with slack=1 over slack=0 if not careful. `-slack` would favor bins that are "more negative" in slack, which isn't directly useful for *fitting*.

A better interpretation for "favoring fuller bins" is to consider bins that, after the item is placed, have the least remaining capacity *overall*, regardless of whether it's a tight fit or a large bin with substantial remaining capacity. However, the "Almost Full Fit" strategy implies a focus on minimizing *waste* after fitting, which aligns with small slack.

Let's consider a strategy that tries to balance "tight fit" with "preferring fuller bins" by also factoring in the *absolute* remaining capacity.
A common approach is to sort by remaining capacity after fitting, but we need a priority score.
We want to prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is minimized (for tight fits).
We also want to prioritize bins that are generally fuller, meaning they have less `bins_remain_cap` *before* the item is added, as long as they can fit the item.

A heuristic that balances these could be:
1.  Prioritize bins that can fit the item.
2.  Among those that fit, favor bins with less remaining capacity *after* the item is placed. This is `potential_remaining_cap`. So, we want to maximize `-potential_remaining_cap`.
3.  To slightly favor "fuller bins" overall (meaning bins that have less capacity to begin with, assuming similar slack), we could add a penalty for larger initial `bins_remain_cap`. Or, more directly, use the negative of the *original* remaining capacity.

Let's try to combine the "tight fit" (`-slack`) with a general "fullness" score.
Consider the score: `-slack + C * (-bins_remain_cap)`, where C is a small constant.
This would favor bins with low slack and low original remaining capacity.

Another interpretation for "inverted slack" could be prioritizing bins that are "almost full", meaning `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item`. This is captured by small slack.
If we want to prioritize *fuller* bins, this might mean preferring bins that are already carrying a lot of items, or have less available capacity *before* the item is added.

A simpler approach to "favoring fuller bins" while keeping "tight fit" might be to maximize `-potential_remaining_cap`. This naturally favors bins that have the least remaining capacity *after* placement. A bin that was initially large but fits the item tightly will have a low `potential_remaining_cap`, and a bin that was initially small and fits the item tightly will also have a low `potential_remaining_cap`.

Let's refine the idea:
The prompt asks for prioritizing "fuller bins" and using "inverted slack".
"Inverted slack" can mean `1/slack` or `-slack`. For fitting, `1/slack` (for `slack > 0`) or `-slack` (maximizing it) makes sense.
Prioritizing "fuller bins" suggests looking at `bins_remain_cap`. Lower `bins_remain_cap` generally means "fuller".

Let's try a heuristic that is a combination of maximizing the negative remaining capacity after fitting (tightest fit) and a term that favors bins with less initial capacity.
Score = `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`  (for tightness)
To favor fuller bins, we could subtract a penalty related to original capacity, or add a term that is high for low original capacity.

Consider `priority = 1.0 / (1.0 + slack)` as in `v1`. This prioritizes minimal slack.
If we want to favor "fuller bins", it means among bins with similar slack, we might prefer the one that was "more full" initially.
Example:
Bin A: cap=10, item=7 => slack=3, remaining_after=3. priority_v1 = 1/4 = 0.25
Bin B: cap=5, item=3 => slack=2, remaining_after=2. priority_v1 = 1/3 = 0.33
Bin C: cap=4, item=3 => slack=1, remaining_after=1. priority_v1 = 1/2 = 0.5

Here, Bin C has the highest priority because it has the smallest slack.
If we want to favor "fuller bins", perhaps Bin B is considered "fuller" than Bin A because it started with less capacity, and managed a decent fit.

Let's try to use the *negative* of the potential remaining capacity directly as the primary driver, as it directly addresses "least remaining capacity".
This is equivalent to maximizing `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
The "inverted slack" phrasing could simply be this maximization of negative slack.

For "favoring fuller bins", we can add a secondary component that penalizes larger original capacities.
A simple way: `priority = -(bins_remain_cap - item) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`
where `alpha` is a small positive constant. This prioritizes small remaining capacity, and then small original capacity.

Let's try to implement a strategy that combines prioritizing bins that result in minimal remaining capacity after packing (tightest fit), and also gives a boost to bins that were "fuller" initially.
"Fuller" can be interpreted as having less remaining capacity to begin with.

So, we want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
And we want to prioritize bins with smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
This means we want to maximize `-bins_remain_cap`.

Combining these: Maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item) - C * bins_remain_cap` for some small `C`.
Or, maximizing `-(bins_remain_cap - item) + C * (-bins_remain_cap)`.

Let's directly use the negative of the potential remaining capacity.
`potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item`
We want to maximize `-potential_remaining_cap` for bins where `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`.

To incorporate "favoring fuller bins", we can add a term that is inversely related to the *original* `bins_remain_cap`.
A common way is to use `1.0 / bins_remain_cap`.
So, we want to maximize `(-potential_remaining_cap) + alpha * (1.0 / bins_remain_cap)`.
Here, `alpha` controls the influence of the "fuller bin" preference.

Let's try:
1.  Calculate `potential_remaining_cap` for all bins that can fit the item.
2.  The primary priority is `-potential_remaining_cap`.
3.  A secondary priority (to favor fuller bins) can be `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon)` to avoid division by zero, giving higher score to smaller initial capacity.

Let's try a simpler heuristic that captures both:
We want to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item`.
If `bins_remain_cap - item` is the same for two bins, pick the one with smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
So, we want to sort primarily by `bins_remain_cap - item` (ascending) and secondarily by `bins_remain_cap` (ascending).

To convert this to priorities where higher is better:
We want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
And then maximize `-(bins_remain_cap)`.

This leads to a composite score:
`priority = -(bins_remain_cap - item) - C * bins_remain_cap`
Or `priority = -bins_remain_cap + item - C * bins_remain_cap`

Let's try the strategy: Maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
This is prioritizing the bin that will have the minimum remaining capacity. This inherently favors tighter fits and also fuller bins if they result in minimal remaining capacity.

A "fuller bin" might also mean one that has less capacity *remaining* generally.
Let's try to use the negative of the potential remaining capacity directly as the priority.
If we want higher priority for smaller remaining capacity, we should use a positive value proportional to how small it is.
So, `priority = MaxPossibleSlack - (bins_remain_cap - item)` for valid bins.
Or, simpler: `priority = - (bins_remain_cap - item)`.

Let's also factor in "inverted slack" as possibly `1/slack`.
If slack is `bins_remain_cap - item`.
Then `1/(bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)`.

Let's combine "tight fit" and "fuller bin" more directly.
"Tight fit": Favor small `bins_remain_cap - item`.
"Fuller bin": Favor small `bins_remain_cap`.

So, we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item` and minimize `bins_remain_cap`.
This is a multi-objective problem. A common way is to use a lexicographical sort or a weighted sum.
Let's try to create a single score.
We can try to maximize `- (bins_remain_cap - item)`. This prioritizes bins that will be most full.
To break ties and favor "fuller bins" (those with less initial capacity), we can add a term related to `-bins_remain_cap`.

Score = `-(bins_remain_cap - item) - C * bins_remain_cap` for a small `C > 0`.
This means we maximize `item - bins_remain_cap - C * bins_remain_cap`.
This prioritizes:
1.  Making `bins_remain_cap - item` as small as possible (most negative if we consider it).
2.  Making `bins_remain_cap` as small as possible.

Let's implement this:
We want to prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and non-negative.
This means `slack` is small and non-negative.
The score should increase as slack decreases.
The score should also increase as `bins_remain_cap` decreases.

Consider the score: `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` which is `item - bins_remain_cap`.
This prioritizes bins that will have the least remaining capacity.
Example: item=3.
Bin A: cap=5 => remaining=2. score = -2.
Bin B: cap=4 => remaining=1. score = -1.
Bin C: cap=3 => remaining=0. score = 0.
This favors bins that will be most full.

Now add "favoring fuller bins" (smaller initial `bins_remain_cap`).
Score = `(item - bins_remain_cap) - C * bins_remain_cap`
Score = `item - (1+C) * bins_remain_cap`

This means we want to maximize `item - (1+C) * bins_remain_cap`.
This prioritizes smaller `bins_remain_cap` more heavily.

Let's try a different approach for "inverted slack".
If slack is `s = bins_remain_cap - item`.
We want to prioritize smaller `s`.
The "inverted slack" might mean `1/s` or similar, but this is unstable for small `s`.
A robust way to favor small `s` is `exp(-k*s)` for `k > 0`.
Or `1.0 / (1.0 + s)`.

For "favoring fuller bins", it means prioritizing smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
So we want to favor smaller `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try to create a score by combining these.
We want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` for tightness.
We want to maximize `-bins_remain_cap` for fullness.

Let's use the negative of the slack as a primary component, and the negative of the original capacity as a secondary component.
Score = `-(bins_remain_cap - item) - C * bins_remain_cap`

Consider the priorities for bins where item fits:
`bins_remain_cap >= item`.
We want to prioritize bins with smaller `bins_remain_cap - item` (slack).
And among those, prioritize bins with smaller `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's create a composite score:
`priority = - (bins_remain_cap - item) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`
where `alpha` is a small positive weight.
This aims to prioritize the smallest remaining capacity, and then the smallest original capacity.

We only compute this for bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
For other bins, the priority is 0.

Example:
item = 3
Bin A: cap=5. Fits. slack=2. remaining_after=2. Score = -(2) - alpha*5 = -2 - 5*alpha
Bin B: cap=4. Fits. slack=1. remaining_after=1. Score = -(1) - alpha*4 = -1 - 4*alpha
Bin C: cap=3. Fits. slack=0. remaining_after=0. Score = -(0) - alpha*3 = 0 - 3*alpha
Bin D: cap=2. No fit. priority = 0.
Bin E: cap=6. Fits. slack=3. remaining_after=3. Score = -(3) - alpha*6 = -3 - 6*alpha

If alpha is small (e.g., 0.1):
Bin A: -2 - 0.5 = -2.5
Bin B: -1 - 0.4 = -1.4
Bin C: 0 - 0.3 = -0.3
Bin E: -3 - 0.6 = -3.6

This favors Bin C (most tight fit), then Bin B, then Bin A. This seems good.
The "inverted slack" is handled by the `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` term which maximizes `-slack`.
The "fuller bins" is handled by the `-alpha * bins_remain_cap` term which maximizes `-bins_remain_cap`.

The function should return higher values for higher priority. So we want to maximize this score.
The score calculated above is `item - bins_remain_cap - alpha * bins_remain_cap`.
To make it simpler and more directly represent priority:
We want to minimize `slack` and then `bins_remain_cap`.
To maximize priority, we can do `MaxSlack - slack` and `MaxCap - bins_remain_cap`.
But this requires knowing the maximums.

Let's stick to the additive score: `-(slack) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`.
This should be calculated only for bins where `slack >= 0`.
Bins that don't fit get a score of negative infinity or a very small number.

Let's use a small epsilon for safety, though it might not be strictly necessary if we clip results later.
`score = -(bins_remain_cap - item) - alpha * bins_remain_cap`
Let's use a positive constant for alpha, say 0.1.
