Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a Best Fit heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored by how little space remains after placement.\n    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority score.\n    \n    Args:\n        item: Size of the item to be packed.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Array of priority scores for each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    fit_scores = item - bins_remain_cap  # Higher score for bins with less remaining space after placement\n    return np.where(can_fit, fit_scores, -np.inf)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nKeywords: Dynamic statistical adaptation, multi-objective blending, smooth scoring, feasibility masking  \nAdvice: Integrate context-aware weights combining residual minimization and fragmentation penalties, using logistic/exponential scoring calibrated to real-time bin/item distributions. Prioritize adaptivity via median/\u03c3-driven thresholds and -\u221e infeasibility masking.  \nAvoid: Fixed/static thresholds, single-objective prioritization, stepwise scoring, soft constraint handling.  \nExplanation: Dynamic thresholds (e.g., \u03bc\u00b1\u03c3) and continuous scoring ensure mathematical robustness, while contextual multi-objective blending prevents brittleness in varying distributions. Rigorous masking maintains feasibility without heuristic fallbacks.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
