**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th): The best uses adaptive thresholds (harmonic mean) and smooth exponential scoring combining fit ratio/penalty, while the worst returns zero. Key difference: adaptability and multi-factorial smooth evaluation.  
(2nd) vs (19th): Best Fit scoring (prioritizes minimal leftover) outperforms null scoring, showing explicit placement logic beats no logic.  
(4th) vs (7th): Adaptive exponential scoring (4th) with context-driven thresholds outperforms fixed-step Best/Worst Fit (7th), highlighting smoothness and dynamic classification advantages.  
(10th) vs (15th): Thresholded tiers (10th) using item-relative thresholds (0.15x/0.4x) still outperform random/null baselines (15th), but lack adaptability of harmonic mean-based methods.  
(1st) vs (2nd): The top heuristic adds capacity scaling for underutilized bins and harmonic mean adaptation, while 2nd uses simpler Best Fit. This shows dynamic context modeling improves over static strategies.  
(6th) vs (9th): Duplicate code in 6th adds harmonic mean adaptation vs 9th's fixed threshold, proving dynamic thresholds > static rules.  
(7th) vs (10th): Step functions (7th) underperform tiered scoring (10th), suggesting discrete tiers > abrupt decisions but still inferior to smooth exponential weighting.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., harmonic mean), smooth exponential scoring, and multi-objective blending (fit ratio + underfill penalty). Avoid fixed thresholds and step functions. Dynamically classify item sizes contextually rather than using static values. Combine capacity scaling with penalty terms for robustness.
