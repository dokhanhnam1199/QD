- **Keywords**: Dynamic thresholds (μ/σ), adaptive weights (α/β scaling), smooth exponential scoring, feasibility masks  
- **Advice**: Prioritize distribution-aware thresholds (median, mean+stddev), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via scaled adaptive weights, use smooth exponential scoring for continuity, enforce strict feasibility via -∞ masks.  
- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, ratio-based scoring, zero-based fallbacks, simplistic priority schemes, contextual size classification.  
- **Explanation**: Dynamic thresholds adapt to real-time data, smooth scoring ensures gradient stability, adaptive weights balance competing objectives, and feasibility masks eliminate invalid choices, collectively enhancing robustness and efficiency.
