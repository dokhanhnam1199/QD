{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize adaptive thresholds using bin statistics (mean, std), blend multiple objectives (residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance), and apply smooth exponential scoring. Avoid static thresholds and ensure dynamic item/bin context awareness.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., item size classification), use mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), and avoid static/random priorities. Tie-breaking secondary terms (e.g., penalizing underfilled bins) and simplicity enhance robustness.\n\nUse adaptive thresholds tied to residual capacities, blend smoothed exponential scoring with secondary penalties, avoid fixed thresholds, minimize fragmentation via tie-breakers, and ensure feasibility masks (-\u221e for invalid bins). Prioritize mathematical continuity.\n\nPrioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., harmonic mean), smooth exponential scoring, and multi-objective blending (fit ratio + underfill penalty). Avoid fixed thresholds and step functions. Dynamically classify item sizes contextually rather than using static values. Combine capacity scaling with penalty terms for robustness.\n\nPrioritize dynamic thresholds, continuous scoring, and multi-objective blending (residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance). Avoid static thresholds, discrete tiers, or zero-based fallbacks. Adapt strategies to item/bin context (e.g., size ratios, distribution statistics).\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
