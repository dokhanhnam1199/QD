**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that top heuristics use dynamic statistical adaptation (mean, std, median) and multi-objective blending (residual minimization + fragmentation penalties), while the worst ones apply rigid soft penalties without contextual awareness. (2nd) vs (19th) show that adaptive thresholds (mean+std) and feasibility masks outperform static thresholds and uniform scoring. (3rd) vs (18th) reveal that explicit feasibility enforcement (-∞ masking) and exponential decay penalties dominate over naive zero-scoring. (6th) vs (17th) highlight that item-relative rewards (e.g., r/item scaling) and multi-component blending (residual + penalty + reward) outperform single-objective approaches. (11th) vs (16th) demonstrate that categorical tiering (tight/moderate/loose fits) with discrete scores underperforms smooth exponential scoring. Overall: Superior heuristics dynamically adapt weights to bin/item statistics, combine residual minimization with fragmentation avoidance via smooth functions, and rigorously enforce feasibility. Inferior ones rely on fixed thresholds, lack multi-objective balance, or fail to penalize infeasibility effectively.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize dynamic statistical adaptation (mean, std, median), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via context-aware weights, use smooth exponential/logistic scoring, and rigorously enforce feasibility with -∞ masking. Avoid fixed thresholds, single-objective designs, and soft infeasibility handling. Contextual item-bin interaction (e.g., r/item scaling) enhances adaptivity.
