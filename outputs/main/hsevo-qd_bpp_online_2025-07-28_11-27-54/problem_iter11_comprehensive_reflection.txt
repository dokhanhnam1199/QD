**Advice**: Use dynamically contextual thresholds based on item/bin size ratios and distribution statistics, blend smoothed exponential scoring with adaptive penalties (e.g., residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance), enforce feasibility masks (-âˆž for invalid bins) to prune invalid actions.  
**Avoid**: Static thresholds, step functions/discrete scoring, zero-based fallbacks, or fixed priority rules.  
**Explanation**: Mathematical continuity and context-aware adaptation prevent abrupt decisions, feasibility masking ensures valid placements, and smooth multi-objective blending balances competing goals (e.g., fit quality vs. bin underfill) to maintain optimization stability and reduce fragmentation.
