- Keywords: Dynamic statistical adaptation (mean, std, quantiles), Landau notation asymptoic weighting, smooth exponential/transcendental blending, asymptotic penalty scaling  
- Advice: Use contextually scaled residual minimization with smooth penalty exponentiation, secondary density penalties via inverse proportionality to bin sparsity, adaptive standardization of weights towards item size harmonics, and rigorous feasibility masking (-∞ on invalids).  
- Avoid: Fixed thresholds, dynamic thresholds tied purely to bin stats (e.g., mean/μ+σ), single objective dominance, and any step functions.  
- Explanation: Dynamic statistical adaptation with smooth exponential blending avoids rigid thresholds while ensuring mathematical continuity. Secondary density penalties balance exploration and packing efficiency. Landau notation asymptotic weighting improves robustness to scale variations, and strict feasibility masking ensures only valid actions are considered.
