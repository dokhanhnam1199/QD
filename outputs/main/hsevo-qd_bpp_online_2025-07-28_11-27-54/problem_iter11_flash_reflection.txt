**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see sophisticated dynamic threshold blending with exponential penalties vs zero scoring; (2nd) vs (19th) shows adaptive item classification vs no prioritization; (1st) vs (2nd) reveals residual-fragmentation tradeoff vs item-size-dependent strategy; (11th) vs (16th) highlights categorical thresholds vs flat scoring; (6th) vs (15th) demonstrates harmonic mean adaptation vs rigid tiers. Top heuristics use context-aware blending, continuous scoring, and multi-objective optimization, while lower ones lack adaptability or nuance.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize dynamic thresholds, continuous scoring, and multi-objective blending (residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance). Avoid static thresholds, discrete tiers, or zero-based fallbacks. Adapt strategies to item/bin context (e.g., size ratios, distribution statistics).
