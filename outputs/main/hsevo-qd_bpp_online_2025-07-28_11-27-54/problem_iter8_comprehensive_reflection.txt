- **Keywords**: Residual capacity thresholds, blended scoring, feasibility masks, mathematical continuity  
- **Advice**: Dynamically adjust thresholds using residual capacities, blend smoothed exponential scoring with secondary penalties (e.g., underfill/fragmentation), enforce feasibility via -âˆž masks for invalid bins, prioritize continuous functions over discrete steps.  
- **Avoid**: Fixed/static thresholds, generic adaptive methods (e.g., vague "item size classification"), step functions, fragmented tie-breakers without contextual grounding.  
- **Explanation**: Contextual thresholds (residual capacity) and mathematically smooth blending enhance adaptability, while feasibility masks ensure valid decisions. Continuity reduces instability vs. step functions, and targeted penalties minimize suboptimal tradeoffs.
