**Keywords**: Dynamic thresholds, statistical context, smooth exponential blending, feasibility masking  
**Advice**: Use bin/item statistics (mean, std) to adaptively weight residual minimization + density-aware penalties; apply smooth exponential/logistic scoring; enforce feasibility via -âˆž masking; prioritize contextual scaling (e.g., size ratios).  
**Avoid**: Static thresholds, discrete tiers, non-adaptive weights, zero-based fallbacks, or step functions.  
**Explanation**: Dynamic statistical adaptation ensures context-aware prioritization, while smooth scoring and feasibility masking prevent fragmentation and invalid allocations. Multi-objective blending with adaptive weights balances residual reduction and density optimization, enhancing robustness across varying distributions.
