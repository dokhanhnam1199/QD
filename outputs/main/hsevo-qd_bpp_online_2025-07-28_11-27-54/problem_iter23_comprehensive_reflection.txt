Keywords: Dynamic statistical adaptation, multi-objective blending, smooth scoring, feasibility masking  
Advice: Integrate context-aware weights combining residual minimization and fragmentation penalties, using logistic/exponential scoring calibrated to real-time bin/item distributions. Prioritize adaptivity via median/σ-driven thresholds and -∞ infeasibility masking.  
Avoid: Fixed/static thresholds, single-objective prioritization, stepwise scoring, soft constraint handling.  
Explanation: Dynamic thresholds (e.g., μ±σ) and continuous scoring ensure mathematical robustness, while contextual multi-objective blending prevents brittleness in varying distributions. Rigorous masking maintains feasibility without heuristic fallbacks.
