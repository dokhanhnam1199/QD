Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize continuous adaptive weights over discrete tiers. Blend residual minimization with density-based rewards using statistical context (mean, std). Use smooth exponential penalties and item-relative scaling to avoid fragmentation. Avoid flat scores or rigid thresholds.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., item size classification), use mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), and avoid static/random priorities. Tie-breaking secondary terms (e.g., penalizing underfilled bins) and simplicity enhance robustness.\n\nUse adaptive thresholds tied to residual capacities, blend smoothed exponential scoring with secondary penalties, avoid fixed thresholds, minimize fragmentation via tie-breakers, and ensure feasibility masks (-\u221e for invalid bins). Prioritize mathematical continuity.\n\nPrioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., harmonic mean), smooth exponential scoring, and multi-objective blending (fit ratio + underfill penalty). Avoid fixed thresholds and step functions. Dynamically classify item sizes contextually rather than using static values. Combine capacity scaling with penalty terms for robustness.\n\nPrioritize dynamic thresholds, continuous scoring, and multi-objective blending (residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance). Avoid static thresholds, discrete tiers, or zero-based fallbacks. Adapt strategies to item/bin context (e.g., size ratios, distribution statistics).\n\nPrioritize adaptive thresholds using bin statistics (mean, std), blend multiple objectives (residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance), and apply smooth exponential scoring. Avoid static thresholds and ensure dynamic item/bin context awareness.\n\nPrioritize dynamic thresholds (median/\u03bc+\u03c3), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via adaptive weights (alpha/beta scaling), use smooth exponential scoring over step functions, and mask infeasible bins rigorously. Avoid static thresholds and simplistic priority schemes.\n\nPrioritize dynamic thresholds (mean/std/median), smooth exponential/logistic penalties, and multi-objective blending. Avoid fixed thresholds, discrete tiers, and non-adaptive weights. Contextual item/bin analysis enhances robustness.\n\nPrioritize dynamic statistical adaptation (mean, std, median), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via context-aware weights, use smooth exponential/logistic scoring, and rigorously enforce feasibility with -\u221e masking. Avoid fixed thresholds, single-objective designs, and soft infeasibility handling. Contextual item-bin interaction (e.g., r/item scaling) enhances adaptivity.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
