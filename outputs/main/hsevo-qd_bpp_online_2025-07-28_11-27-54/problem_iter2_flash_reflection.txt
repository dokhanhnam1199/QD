**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (13th-20th): The hybrid strategy (1st) adapts to item size (small/large) for dynamic prioritization, while the worst heuristics (zeros/random) lack discriminative logic. (2nd) vs (15th): Standard Best Fit (2nd) outperforms quantum-inspired variants (15th) by avoiding unnecessary complexity (e.g., sinusoidal noise). (3rd) vs (10th): Ratio-based scoring (3rd) and exponential weighting (10th) both prioritize tight fits but the formerâ€™s simplicity aids stability. (6th) vs (7th): Secondary penalization of bin capacity (6th) improves over inverse residual scoring (7th) by balancing fit quality and bin density. (20th) vs (others): The niche strategy of reserving space for future items (20th) underperforms due to over-specialization. Overall: Top heuristics focus on **adaptive, mathematically grounded prioritization** of fit quality, while worst ones suffer from randomness, oversimplification, or excessive noise.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., item size classification), use mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), and avoid static/random priorities. Tie-breaking secondary terms (e.g., penalizing underfilled bins) and simplicity enhance robustness.
