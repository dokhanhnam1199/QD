Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a thresholded categorical heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored in discrete tiers based on normalized\n    remaining space after placement.

Smooth exponential scoring and dynamic statistical blending dominate in better heuristics.  \n\n**2nd vs 13th**: The 2nd introduces adaptive density rewards via z-scores and median-based thresholds, whereas the 13th-20th (identical) use static penalty factors and threshold clipping without contextual adaptability.  \n\n**3rd vs 4th**: The 3rd balances residual minimization and fragmentation penalties via tanh-weighted coefficient of variation, while the 4th combines item-relative exponential rewards with less dynamic statistical normalization.  \n\n**5th vs 10th**: Mid-ranked heuristics like the 5th/6th use item-size classification (small/large) with exponential scoring, while the 10th/11th apply fixed categorical tiers (tight/moderate/loose), which are less responsive to distribution shifts.  \n\n**12th (worst)** simply returns zeros, ignoring feasibility and context entirely.  \n\nOverall: Top heuristics excel through **adaptive statistical blending**, **smooth exponential scoring**, and **multi-objective prioritization** (e.g., residual minimization + density rewards), while lower-ranked ones suffer from fixed thresholds, non-smooth penalties, or lack of contextual adaptivity.\n- \nKeywords: Adaptive weights (CV-based), smooth exponential/logistic scoring, multi-objective blending, feasibility masking  \nAdvice: Prioritize context-aware adaptive weights over thresholds, blend residual/density objectives with smooth scoring, use logistic transitions for continuity, enforce feasibility strictly via -\u221e masks.  \nAvoid: Fixed thresholds, step functions, secondary tie-breakers, soft infeasibility handling  \nExplanation: Adaptive weights (vs. thresholds) improve context sensitivity without abrupt transitions. Smooth scoring ensures mathematical continuity for stable gradients. Multi-objective blending balances residual minimization and density efficiency. Strict feasibility masking eliminates invalid solutions, enhancing robustness.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
