Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Priority heuristic combining dynamic bin statistics with item-relative rewards.\n    \n    Uses adaptive thresholds (mean+std) and smooth penalties from v0, augmented with\n    item-aware exponential rewards (v1-inspired) to prioritize fits where remaining space\n    is small relative to item size.

Smooth exponential scoring and dynamic statistical blending dominate in better heuristics.  \n\n**2nd vs 13th**: The 2nd introduces adaptive density rewards via z-scores and median-based thresholds, whereas the 13th-20th (identical) use static penalty factors and threshold clipping without contextual adaptability.  \n\n**3rd vs 4th**: The 3rd balances residual minimization and fragmentation penalties via tanh-weighted coefficient of variation, while the 4th combines item-relative exponential rewards with less dynamic statistical normalization.  \n\n**5th vs 10th**: Mid-ranked heuristics like the 5th/6th use item-size classification (small/large) with exponential scoring, while the 10th/11th apply fixed categorical tiers (tight/moderate/loose), which are less responsive to distribution shifts.  \n\n**12th (worst)** simply returns zeros, ignoring feasibility and context entirely.  \n\nOverall: Top heuristics excel through **adaptive statistical blending**, **smooth exponential scoring**, and **multi-objective prioritization** (e.g., residual minimization + density rewards), while lower-ranked ones suffer from fixed thresholds, non-smooth penalties, or lack of contextual adaptivity.\n- \nKeywords: Adaptive weights (CV-based), smooth exponential/logistic scoring, multi-objective blending, feasibility masking  \nAdvice: Prioritize context-aware adaptive weights over thresholds, blend residual/density objectives with smooth scoring, use logistic transitions for continuity, enforce feasibility strictly via -\u221e masks.  \nAvoid: Fixed thresholds, step functions, secondary tie-breakers, soft infeasibility handling  \nExplanation: Adaptive weights (vs. thresholds) improve context sensitivity without abrupt transitions. Smooth scoring ensures mathematical continuity for stable gradients. Multi-objective blending balances residual minimization and density efficiency. Strict feasibility masking eliminates invalid solutions, enhancing robustness.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
