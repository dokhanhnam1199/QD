Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not feasible.any():\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    r = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible_r = r[feasible]\n    \n    mu = feasible_r.mean()\n    std = feasible_r.std()\n    eps = 1e-6\n    tau = mu + std + eps  # Dynamic scale combining central tendency and spread\n    \n    # Smooth penalty term to avoid extreme fragmentation\n    penalty_term = np.exp(-r / tau)\n    \n    # Adaptive weight balancing residual minimization and fragmentation avoidance\n    beta = item / tau\n    \n    # Multi-objective score blending\n    residual_objective = -r\n    fragmentation_objective = -beta * penalty_term\n    score = residual_objective + fragmentation_objective\n    \n    return np.where(feasible, score, -np.inf).astype(np.float64)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    # Compute dynamic bin statistics\n    mu = np.mean(bins_remain_cap)\n    sigma = np.std(bins_remain_cap)\n    epsilon = 1e-8  # Small epsilon to prevent division by zero\n\n    # Adaptive penalty factor based on average remaining capacity\n    penalty_factor = 1.0 / (mu + epsilon)\n    \n    # Threshold for fragmentation avoidance (1\u03c3 below mean)\n    threshold = mu - sigma\n    \n    # Residual in remaining capacity after placing the item\n    residual = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible = residual >= 0\n    \n    # Compute feasible bin scores\n    # Term1: Exponential decay for residual minimization\n    term1 = np.exp(- residual * penalty_factor)\n    \n    # Term2: Fragmentation penalty (exponential decay on threshold deficit)\n    delta = np.clip(threshold - residual, a_min=0.0, a_max=None)\n    term2 = np.exp(- delta * penalty_factor)\n    \n    feasible_scores = term1 * term2\n    \n    # Compute infeasible bin scores (soft penalty)\n    deficit = item - bins_remain_cap\n    infeasible_scores = np.exp(- deficit * penalty_factor * 5.0)  # Stronger penalty for overflow\n    \n    # Combine using convex-like combination (soft masking)\n    scores = np.where(feasible, feasible_scores, infeasible_scores)\n    \n    return scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (17th-18th): Top heuristics use adaptive statistical weights (mean, std, logistic balance) for multi-objective blending, while worst ones return flat scores (no prioritization).  \n(2nd) vs (19th-20th): Better heuristics use dynamic thresholds (e.g., item-to-capacity ratios) and exponential penalties, while lower-ranked ones rely on static \u03c3-based thresholds with less contextual adaptivity.  \n(3rd) vs (11th-16th): Smooth exponential scoring (3rd) outperforms discrete tiered scoring (11th-16th) by avoiding abrupt thresholds and enabling gradient-based bin selection.  \n(4th) vs (5th): Dynamic median-based blending (4th) balances residual minimization and fragmentation avoidance more robustly than fixed thresholds.  \n(6th-7th) vs (8th-10th): Heuristics combining residual objectives with item-relative rewards (e.g., r/item normalization) adapt better to varying item sizes than\u5355\u4e00 penalty terms.\n- \n**Keywords**: Dynamic thresholds, statistical context, smooth exponential blending, feasibility masking  \n**Advice**: Use bin/item statistics (mean, std) to adaptively weight residual minimization + density-aware penalties; apply smooth exponential/logistic scoring; enforce feasibility via -\u221e masking; prioritize contextual scaling (e.g., size ratios).  \n**Avoid**: Static thresholds, discrete tiers, non-adaptive weights, zero-based fallbacks, or step functions.  \n**Explanation**: Dynamic statistical adaptation ensures context-aware prioritization, while smooth scoring and feasibility masking prevent fragmentation and invalid allocations. Multi-objective blending with adaptive weights balances residual reduction and density optimization, enhancing robustness across varying distributions.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
