- **Keywords**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring, secondary tie-breakers, simplicity  
- **Advice**: Prioritize dynamic context-driven thresholds (e.g., item size classification), mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), secondary tie-breaking terms (e.g., underfill penalties), and minimalistic design.  
- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), overcomplicated tie-breakers, and rigid priorities.  
- **Explanation**: Dynamic adaptation ensures robustness across scenarios, smooth scoring enables gradient-based optimization, secondary terms resolve ties effectively, and simplicity reduces computational overhead while avoiding brittleness from fixed rules.
