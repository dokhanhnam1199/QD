Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores using dynamic threshold blending with exponential penalties.\n    \n    Blends residual minimization with fragmentation avoidance via:\n    1.

Top heuristics use context-aware blending, continuous scoring, and multi-objective optimization, while lower ones lack adaptability or nuance.\n- \nKeywords: Contextual Adaptation, Smooth Multi-Objective Blending, Feasibility Masks, Continuity-Driven Scoring  \n**Advice**: Use dynamically contextual thresholds based on item/bin size ratios and distribution statistics, blend smoothed exponential scoring with adaptive penalties (e.g., residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance), enforce feasibility masks (-\u221e for invalid bins) to prune invalid actions.  \n**Avoid**: Static thresholds, step functions/discrete scoring, zero-based fallbacks, or fixed priority rules.  \n**Explanation**: Mathematical continuity and context-aware adaptation prevent abrupt decisions, feasibility masking ensures valid placements, and smooth multi-objective blending balances competing goals (e.g., fit quality vs. bin underfill) to maintain optimization stability and reduce fragmentation.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
