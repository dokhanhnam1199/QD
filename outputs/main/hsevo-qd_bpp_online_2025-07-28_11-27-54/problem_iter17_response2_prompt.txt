Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not feasible.any():\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    r = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible_r = r[feasible]\n    \n    mu = feasible_r.mean()\n    std = feasible_r.std()\n    eps = 1e-6\n    tau = mu + std + eps  # Dynamic scale combining central tendency and spread\n    \n    # Smooth penalty term to avoid extreme fragmentation\n    penalty_term = np.exp(-r / tau)\n    \n    # Adaptive weight balancing residual minimization and fragmentation avoidance\n    beta = item / tau\n    \n    # Multi-objective score blending\n    residual_objective = -r\n    fragmentation_objective = -beta * penalty_term\n    score = residual_objective + fragmentation_objective\n    \n    return np.where(feasible, score, -np.inf).astype(np.float64)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive alpha blending with dynamic thresholds (median-based) in 1st outperforms static penalty factors in 20th. (3rd) vs (12th): 3rd\u2019s context-aware tau (\u03bc+\u03c3) balances residual minimization and fragmentation avoidance, while 12th\u2019s zero-scores fail to prioritize. (6th) vs (4th): Smooth exponential scoring in 6th improves bin utilization over 4th\u2019s rigid step-function thresholds. (11th) vs (15th): Item-relative tiered thresholds in 11th reduce fragmentation better than 15th\u2019s generic penalty terms. Overall: Top heuristics use dynamic thresholds, multi-objective blending, and smooth scoring; worst rely on static rules or trivial outputs.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Dynamic thresholds (\u03bc/\u03c3), adaptive weights (\u03b1/\u03b2 scaling), smooth exponential scoring, feasibility masks  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize distribution-aware thresholds (median, mean+stddev), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via scaled adaptive weights, use smooth exponential scoring for continuity, enforce strict feasibility via -\u221e masks.  \n- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, ratio-based scoring, zero-based fallbacks, simplistic priority schemes, contextual size classification.  \n- **Explanation**: Dynamic thresholds adapt to real-time data, smooth scoring ensures gradient stability, adaptive weights balance competing objectives, and feasibility masks eliminate invalid choices, collectively enhancing robustness and efficiency.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
