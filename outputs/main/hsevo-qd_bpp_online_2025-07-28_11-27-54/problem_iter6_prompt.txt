Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a Best Fit heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored by how little space remains after placement.\n    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority score.\n    \n    Args:\n        item: Size of the item to be packed.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Array of priority scores for each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    fit_scores = item - bins_remain_cap  # Higher score for bins with less remaining space after placement\n    return np.where(can_fit, fit_scores, -np.inf)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nKeywords: Dynamic threshold anchors, non-smooth scoring, static consistency, primary-term focus  \n**Advice**: Use fixed thresholds adjusted contextually, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), static priority rules, and emphasize primary objectives without secondary penalties.  \n**Avoid**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring (ratios/exponentials), secondary tie-break terms, oversimplification.  \n**Explanation**: Ineffective practices caused instability and overfitting. Anchored thresholds balance adaptability and stability. Non-smooth scoring aligns with discrete decisions. Static consistency reduces overhead. Primary-term focus streamlines decisions for complexity.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
