**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive alpha blending with dynamic thresholds (median-based) in 1st outperforms static penalty factors in 20th. (3rd) vs (12th): 3rd’s context-aware tau (μ+σ) balances residual minimization and fragmentation avoidance, while 12th’s zero-scores fail to prioritize. (6th) vs (4th): Smooth exponential scoring in 6th improves bin utilization over 4th’s rigid step-function thresholds. (11th) vs (15th): Item-relative tiered thresholds in 11th reduce fragmentation better than 15th’s generic penalty terms. Overall: Top heuristics use dynamic thresholds, multi-objective blending, and smooth scoring; worst rely on static rules or trivial outputs.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize dynamic thresholds (median/μ+σ), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via adaptive weights (alpha/beta scaling), use smooth exponential scoring over step functions, and mask infeasible bins rigorously. Avoid static thresholds and simplistic priority schemes.
