Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

(2nd) vs (15th): Standard Best Fit (2nd) outperforms quantum-inspired variants (15th) by avoiding unnecessary complexity (e.g., sinusoidal noise). (3rd) vs (10th): Ratio-based scoring (3rd) and exponential weighting (10th) both prioritize tight fits but the former\u2019s simplicity aids stability. (6th) vs (7th): Secondary penalization of bin capacity (6th) improves over inverse residual scoring (7th) by balancing fit quality and bin density. (20th) vs (others): The niche strategy of reserving space for future items (20th) underperforms due to over-specialization. Overall: Top heuristics focus on **adaptive, mathematically grounded prioritization** of fit quality, while worst ones suffer from randomness, oversimplification, or excessive noise.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring, secondary tie-breakers, simplicity  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize dynamic context-driven thresholds (e.g., item size classification), mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), secondary tie-breaking terms (e.g., underfill penalties), and minimalistic design.  \n- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), overcomplicated tie-breakers, and rigid priorities.  \n- **Explanation**: Dynamic adaptation ensures robustness across scenarios, smooth scoring enables gradient-based optimization, secondary terms resolve ties effectively, and simplicity reduces computational overhead while avoiding brittleness from fixed rules.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
