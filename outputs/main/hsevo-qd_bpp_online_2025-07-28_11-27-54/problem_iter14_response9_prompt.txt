Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not feasible.any():\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=np.float64)\n    \n    r = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible_r = r[feasible]\n    \n    mu = feasible_r.mean()\n    std = feasible_r.std()\n    eps = 1e-6\n    tau = mu + std + eps  # Dynamic scale combining central tendency and spread\n    \n    # Smooth penalty term to avoid extreme fragmentation\n    penalty_term = np.exp(-r / tau)\n    \n    # Adaptive weight balancing residual minimization and fragmentation avoidance\n    beta = item / tau\n    \n    # Multi-objective score blending\n    residual_objective = -r\n    fragmentation_objective = -beta * penalty_term\n    score = residual_objective + fragmentation_objective\n    \n    return np.where(feasible, score, -np.inf).astype(np.float64)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive multi-objective scoring (residual + fragmentation) vs static zero scores; (2nd) uses harmonic mean for item classification vs (19th)'s random returns; (3rd) leverages dynamic tau scaling vs (18th)'s flat cannot_fit_score. Top heuristics (1-2) integrate statistical measures (\u03bc, \u03c3, harmonic mean) and smooth exponential penalties to balance space utilization and fragmentation, while lower ones (11-17) use rigid thresholds. (7th) combines Worst Fit/Best Fit via item size classification, outperforming (18-20)'s non-adaptive strategies. Worst heuristics (18-20) fail to differentiate bins entirely.\n- \nKeywords: Contextual dynamic thresholds (bin statistics), core objective blending, smooth exponential continuity, feasibility-aware scoring  \nAdvice: Use thresholds derived from real-time bin statistics (mean/std), integrate objectives like residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance as primary terms, ensure scoring differentiability via exponential functions, and replace invalid-bin masks with soft feasibility penalties.  \nAvoid: Item-classification thresholds, tie-breaker penalties (e.g., underfill terms), step functions/discrete tiers, and -\u221e feasibility masks.  \nExplanation: Bin-centric adaptivity and unified objectives reduce heuristic rigidity, while mathematical continuity improves gradient-guided optimization. Soft feasibility constraints maintain search stability versus hard thresholds.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
