Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a Best Fit heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored by how little space remains after placement.\n    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority score.\n    \n    Args:\n        item: Size of the item to be packed.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Array of priority scores for each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    fit_scores = item - bins_remain_cap  # Higher score for bins with less remaining space after placement\n    return np.where(can_fit, fit_scores, -np.inf)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nKeywords: Contextual Adaptation, Smooth Multi-Objective Blending, Feasibility Masks, Continuity-Driven Scoring  \n**Advice**: Use dynamically contextual thresholds based on item/bin size ratios and distribution statistics, blend smoothed exponential scoring with adaptive penalties (e.g., residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance), enforce feasibility masks (-\u221e for invalid bins) to prune invalid actions.  \n**Avoid**: Static thresholds, step functions/discrete scoring, zero-based fallbacks, or fixed priority rules.  \n**Explanation**: Mathematical continuity and context-aware adaptation prevent abrupt decisions, feasibility masking ensures valid placements, and smooth multi-objective blending balances competing goals (e.g., fit quality vs. bin underfill) to maintain optimization stability and reduce fragmentation.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
