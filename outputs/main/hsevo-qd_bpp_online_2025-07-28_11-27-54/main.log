### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize adaptive thresholds (e.g., item size classification), use mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), and avoid static/random priorities. Tie-breaking secondary terms (e.g., penalizing underfilled bins) and simplicity enhance robustness.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing (1st) vs (13th-20th): The hybrid strategy (1st) adapts to item size (small/large) for dynamic prioritization, while the worst heuristics (zeros/random) lack discriminative logic. (2nd) vs (15th): Standard Best Fit (2nd) outperforms quantum-inspired variants (15th) by avoiding unnecessary complexity (e.g., sinusoidal noise). (3rd) vs (10th): Ratio-based scoring (3rd) and exponential weighting (10th) both prioritize tight fits but the former’s simplicity aids stability. (6th) vs (7th): Secondary penalization of bin capacity (6th) improves over inverse residual scoring (7th) by balancing fit quality and bin density. (20th) vs (others): The niche strategy of reserving space for future items (20th) underperforms due to over-specialization. Overall: Top heuristics focus on **adaptive, mathematically grounded prioritization** of fit quality, while worst ones suffer from randomness, oversimplification, or excessive noise.
- 
- **Keywords**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring, secondary tie-breakers, simplicity  
- **Advice**: Prioritize dynamic context-driven thresholds (e.g., item size classification), mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), secondary tie-breaking terms (e.g., underfill penalties), and minimalistic design.  
- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), overcomplicated tie-breakers, and rigid priorities.  
- **Explanation**: Dynamic adaptation ensures robustness across scenarios, smooth scoring enables gradient-based optimization, secondary terms resolve ties effectively, and simplicity reduces computational overhead while avoiding brittleness from fixed rules.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority scores for bins using a Best Fit heuristic.
    
    Bins that can fit the item are scored by how little space remains after placement.
    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority score.
    
    Args:
        item: Size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.
    
    Returns:
        Array of priority scores for each bin.
    """
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    fit_scores = item - bins_remain_cap  # Higher score for bins with less remaining space after placement
    return np.where(can_fit, fit_scores, -np.inf)

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
- **Keywords**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring, secondary tie-breakers, simplicity  
- **Advice**: Prioritize dynamic context-driven thresholds (e.g., item size classification), mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), secondary tie-breaking terms (e.g., underfill penalties), and minimalistic design.  
- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), overcomplicated tie-breakers, and rigid priorities.  
- **Explanation**: Dynamic adaptation ensures robustness across scenarios, smooth scoring enables gradient-based optimization, secondary terms resolve ties effectively, and simplicity reduces computational overhead while avoiding brittleness from fixed rules.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
