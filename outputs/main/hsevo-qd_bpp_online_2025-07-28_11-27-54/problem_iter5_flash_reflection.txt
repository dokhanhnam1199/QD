**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive dynamic classification significantly outperforms static zero-priority baselines; (3rd) vs (10th) highlights exponential smoothing over linear Best Fit improves fragmentation control. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), harmonic mean-driven thresholds adapt better than fixed ones. (5th) vs (3rd) reveals tie-breaker mechanisms (underfill penalty, capacity scaling) reduce residual waste. Comparing (11th) vs (20th) shows zero prioritization equals randomness. Comparing (3rd) vs (5th), dual strategy blending (Worst/Best Fit variations) paired with exponential decay dominates naive Best Fit.  

**Experience:**  
Use adaptive thresholds tied to residual capacities, blend smoothed exponential scoring with secondary penalties, avoid fixed thresholds, minimize fragmentation via tie-breakers, and ensure feasibility masks (-âˆž for invalid bins). Prioritize mathematical continuity.
