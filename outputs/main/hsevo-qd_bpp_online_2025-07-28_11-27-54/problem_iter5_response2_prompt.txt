Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Adaptive exponential scoring combining Worst Fit for small items and Best Fit for large items.\n    \n    Uses smooth exponential prioritization for both cases: exp(remaining capacity) for small items,\n    exp(-leftover) for large items to minimize fragmentation.

Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), harmonic mean-driven thresholds adapt better than fixed ones. (5th) vs (3rd) reveals tie-breaker mechanisms (underfill penalty, capacity scaling) reduce residual waste. Comparing (11th) vs (20th) shows zero prioritization equals randomness. Comparing (3rd) vs (5th), dual strategy blending (Worst/Best Fit variations) paired with exponential decay dominates naive Best Fit.\n- \nKeywords: Dynamic threshold anchors, non-smooth scoring, static consistency, primary-term focus  \n**Advice**: Use fixed thresholds adjusted contextually, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), static priority rules, and emphasize primary objectives without secondary penalties.  \n**Avoid**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring (ratios/exponentials), secondary tie-break terms, oversimplification.  \n**Explanation**: Ineffective practices caused instability and overfitting. Anchored thresholds balance adaptability and stability. Non-smooth scoring aligns with discrete decisions. Static consistency reduces overhead. Primary-term focus streamlines decisions for complexity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
