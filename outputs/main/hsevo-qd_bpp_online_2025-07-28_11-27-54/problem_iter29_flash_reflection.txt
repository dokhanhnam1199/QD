**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (worst): Top heuristics use dynamic thresholds (median/std) and smooth exponential penalties to balance residual minimization with fragmentation avoidance, while the worst (zeros-returning) ignore item/bin context entirely.  
(2nd) vs (second worst): Adaptive weights (beta=cv-based) in 2nd improve contextual balance vs. 16th-20th's fixed penalty factors.  
(3rd) vs (4th): Basic Best Fit (3rd) lacks statistical adaptation vs. 4th's z-score density rewards.  
(5th) vs (6th): 5th's cv-driven weight blending outperforms 6th's static exponential components.  
(10th) vs (11th): Thresholded tiers (10th) introduce instability vs. 11th's complete non-decision.  
Overall: Superior heuristics combine **dynamic statistical adaptation** (cv, median, z-scores), **multi-objective smooth blending** (exponential/logistic penalties), and **hard feasibility masking**, while inferior ones use rigid thresholds, ignore context, or fail to penalize fragmentation.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize dynamic statistical adaptation (e.g., cv-based weights), blend residual minimization with fragmentation penalties via smooth functions (exp, logistic), enforce feasibility strictly with -âˆž masking, and avoid hard thresholds or static scoring. Context-aware exponential penalties outperform discrete tiers.
