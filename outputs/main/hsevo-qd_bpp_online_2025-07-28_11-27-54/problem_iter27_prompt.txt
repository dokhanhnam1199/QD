Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a Best Fit heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored by how little space remains after placement.\n    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority score.\n    \n    Args:\n        item: Size of the item to be packed.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Array of priority scores for each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    fit_scores = item - bins_remain_cap  # Higher score for bins with less remaining space after placement\n    return np.where(can_fit, fit_scores, -np.inf)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n**Keywords**: Dynamic thresholds, statistical context, smooth exponential blending, feasibility masking  \n**Advice**: Use bin/item statistics (mean, std) to adaptively weight residual minimization + density-aware penalties; apply smooth exponential/logistic scoring; enforce feasibility via -\u221e masking; prioritize contextual scaling (e.g., size ratios).  \n**Avoid**: Static thresholds, discrete tiers, non-adaptive weights, zero-based fallbacks, or step functions.  \n**Explanation**: Dynamic statistical adaptation ensures context-aware prioritization, while smooth scoring and feasibility masking prevent fragmentation and invalid allocations. Multi-objective blending with adaptive weights balances residual reduction and density optimization, enhancing robustness across varying distributions.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
