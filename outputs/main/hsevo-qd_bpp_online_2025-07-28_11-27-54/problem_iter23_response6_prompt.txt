Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Adaptive priority using mean+std thresholding to blend residual minimization and fragmentation penalties.\"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    r = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Dynamic threshold using mean+std of feasible bins (or all bins if none feasible)\n    feasible_caps = bins_remain_cap[can_fit]\n    if feasible_caps.size == 0:\n        mu, sigma = np.mean(bins_remain_cap), np.std(bins_remain_cap)\n    else:\n        mu, sigma = np.mean(feasible_caps), np.std(feasible_caps)\n    T = np.clip(mu + sigma, 1e-8, None)\n    \n    # Adaptive alpha blending based on item-to-threshold ratio\n    alpha = 1.0 - np.exp(-item / T)\n    \n    # Fragmentation penalty using exponential decay\n    feasible_r = np.where(can_fit, r, np.inf)\n    penalty_term = np.exp(-feasible_r / T)\n    \n    # Multi-objective blend with feasibility enforcement\n    blended_score = alpha * (-r) + (1 - alpha) * (-penalty_term)\n    return np.where(can_fit, blended_score, -np.inf)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    # Compute dynamic bin statistics\n    mu = np.mean(bins_remain_cap)\n    sigma = np.std(bins_remain_cap)\n    epsilon = 1e-8  # Small epsilon to prevent division by zero\n\n    # Adaptive penalty factor based on average remaining capacity\n    penalty_factor = 1.0 / (mu + epsilon)\n    \n    # Threshold for fragmentation avoidance (1\u03c3 below mean)\n    threshold = mu - sigma\n    \n    # Residual in remaining capacity after placing the item\n    residual = bins_remain_cap - item\n    feasible = residual >= 0\n    \n    # Compute feasible bin scores\n    # Term1: Exponential decay for residual minimization\n    term1 = np.exp(- residual * penalty_factor)\n    \n    # Term2: Fragmentation penalty (exponential decay on threshold deficit)\n    delta = np.clip(threshold - residual, a_min=0.0, a_max=None)\n    term2 = np.exp(- delta * penalty_factor)\n    \n    feasible_scores = term1 * term2\n    \n    # Compute infeasible bin scores (soft penalty)\n    deficit = item - bins_remain_cap\n    infeasible_scores = np.exp(- deficit * penalty_factor * 5.0)  # Stronger penalty for overflow\n    \n    # Combine using convex-like combination (soft masking)\n    scores = np.where(feasible, feasible_scores, infeasible_scores)\n    \n    return scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that top heuristics use dynamic statistical adaptation (mean, std, median) and multi-objective blending (residual minimization + fragmentation penalties), while the worst ones apply rigid soft penalties without contextual awareness. (2nd) vs (19th) show that adaptive thresholds (mean+std) and feasibility masks outperform static thresholds and uniform scoring. (3rd) vs (18th) reveal that explicit feasibility enforcement (-\u221e masking) and exponential decay penalties dominate over naive zero-scoring. (6th) vs (17th) highlight that item-relative rewards (e.g., r/item scaling) and multi-component blending (residual + penalty + reward) outperform single-objective approaches. (11th) vs (16th) demonstrate that categorical tiering (tight/moderate/loose fits) with discrete scores underperforms smooth exponential scoring. Overall: Superior heuristics dynamically adapt weights to bin/item statistics, combine residual minimization with fragmentation avoidance via smooth functions, and rigorously enforce feasibility. Inferior ones rely on fixed thresholds, lack multi-objective balance, or fail to penalize infeasibility effectively.\n- \nKeywords: Dynamic statistical adaptation, multi-objective blending, smooth scoring, feasibility masking  \nAdvice: Integrate context-aware weights combining residual minimization and fragmentation penalties, using logistic/exponential scoring calibrated to real-time bin/item distributions. Prioritize adaptivity via median/\u03c3-driven thresholds and -\u221e infeasibility masking.  \nAvoid: Fixed/static thresholds, single-objective prioritization, stepwise scoring, soft constraint handling.  \nExplanation: Dynamic thresholds (e.g., \u03bc\u00b1\u03c3) and continuous scoring ensure mathematical robustness, while contextual multi-objective blending prevents brittleness in varying distributions. Rigorous masking maintains feasibility without heuristic fallbacks.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
