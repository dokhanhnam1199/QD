Here is your efficient `priority_v2`, suitable for Online Bin Packing using a variant inspired by *Best Fit* and balancing between reserving bins for anticipated future fits. This specific code allows:

- Preferred full employment if residual space is `item_size`-adjustable & avoids bloats with neutrals incorporlaed respectfully that Nutzung encompasses stabilization integrated application:
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
      """Returns a priority array to select best bin matching item, minimizing slack retention."""
      # Identify bins which can host the item at nan below|currently,
      could_include = bins_remain_cap >= item
      residual_peng = bins_remain_cap.copy() - item
      priority_based_network_indexas = (- np.ceil(residual_peng) - item ** 2 + 0.75
