Keywords: Adaptive bin statistics, smooth penalty gradients, multi-objective context blending, feasibility masking  
Advice: Use bin/item-aware dynamic thresholds (e.g., std dev from current load mean), penalize fragmentation with continuous functions (logistic decay), balance fit and future capacity in scoring, enforce hard constraints with -âˆž masks.  
Avoid: Fixed thresholds, stepwise penalties, static weight ratios, context-ignorant scoring  
Explanation: Dynamic thresholds adapt to evolving distributions, smooth gradients enable stable convergence, multi-objective tradeoffs prevent myopic decisions, and feasibility masks guarantee valid allocations.
