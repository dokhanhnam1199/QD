**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (15th-16th), we see dynamic statistical thresholds (mean+std) and smooth exponential penalties outperform static zero-scores; (2nd) vs (5th) shows adaptive item classification with exponential scoring surpasses fixed thresholds and step functions; (3rd-4th) use linear Best Fit, inferior to distribution-aware blending in (6th-8th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both leverage smooth adaptivity but (1st) integrates spread (std) for fragmentation control. (3rd) vs (4th) are duplicates, highlighting linear scoring limitations. (5th) vs (15th) reveals even basic heuristics outperform no strategy. Overall: superior heuristics balance residual minimization, fragmentation avoidance, and contextual adaptivity via smooth, dynamic scoring.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize dynamic thresholds (mean/std/median), smooth exponential/logistic penalties, and multi-objective blending. Avoid fixed thresholds, discrete tiers, and non-adaptive weights. Contextual item/bin analysis enhances robustness.
