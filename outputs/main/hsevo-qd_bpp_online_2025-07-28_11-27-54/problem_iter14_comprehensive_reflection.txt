Keywords: Contextual dynamic thresholds (bin statistics), core objective blending, smooth exponential continuity, feasibility-aware scoring  
Advice: Use thresholds derived from real-time bin statistics (mean/std), integrate objectives like residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance as primary terms, ensure scoring differentiability via exponential functions, and replace invalid-bin masks with soft feasibility penalties.  
Avoid: Item-classification thresholds, tie-breaker penalties (e.g., underfill terms), step functions/discrete tiers, and -âˆž feasibility masks.  
Explanation: Bin-centric adaptivity and unified objectives reduce heuristic rigidity, while mathematical continuity improves gradient-guided optimization. Soft feasibility constraints maintain search stability versus hard thresholds.
