Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a Best Fit heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored by how little space remains after placement.\n    Bins that cannot fit the item receive a very low priority score.\n    \n    Args:\n        item: Size of the item to be packed.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n    \n    Returns:\n        Array of priority scores for each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    fit_scores = item - bins_remain_cap  # Higher score for bins with less remaining space after placement\n    return np.where(can_fit, fit_scores, -np.inf)\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nKeywords: Contextual dynamic thresholds (bin statistics), core objective blending, smooth exponential continuity, feasibility-aware scoring  \nAdvice: Use thresholds derived from real-time bin statistics (mean/std), integrate objectives like residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance as primary terms, ensure scoring differentiability via exponential functions, and replace invalid-bin masks with soft feasibility penalties.  \nAvoid: Item-classification thresholds, tie-breaker penalties (e.g., underfill terms), step functions/discrete tiers, and -\u221e feasibility masks.  \nExplanation: Bin-centric adaptivity and unified objectives reduce heuristic rigidity, while mathematical continuity improves gradient-guided optimization. Soft feasibility constraints maintain search stability versus hard thresholds.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
