Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Combines residual minimization and density-based rewards with adaptive weights.\n    \n    Uses z-score density of residuals and normalized fit scores, blending objectives\n    via logistic-weighted sum calibrated to bin capacity distribution statistics.\n    \"\"\"\n    EPS = 1e-8\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return -np.inf * np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    # Residual and basic fit score\n    r = bins_remain_cap - item\n    fit_score = (-r) / (item + EPS)  # Item-relative normalization\n    \n    # Statistical context\n    mu, sigma = np.mean(bins_remain_cap), np.std(bins_remain_cap)\n    z = (r - mu) / (sigma + EPS)\n    \n    # Density-based reward (smooth exponential scoring)\n    density_reward = np.exp(-0.5 * z**2)\n    \n    # Adaptive weight via logistic coefficient of variation\n    cv = sigma / (mu + EPS)\n    weight = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-cv))  # Dynamic balance factor\n    \n    # Multi-objective blend and feasibility mask\n    combined = weight * fit_score + (1 - weight) * density_reward\n    return np.where(feasible, combined, -np.inf)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins using a thresholded categorical heuristic.\n    \n    Bins that can fit the item are scored in discrete tiers based on normalized\n    remaining space after placement.

Multi-objective blending with adaptive weights balances residual reduction and density optimization, enhancing robustness across varying distributions.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
