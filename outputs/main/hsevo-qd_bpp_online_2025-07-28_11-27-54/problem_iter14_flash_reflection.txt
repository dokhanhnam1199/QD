**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive multi-objective scoring (residual + fragmentation) vs static zero scores; (2nd) uses harmonic mean for item classification vs (19th)'s random returns; (3rd) leverages dynamic tau scaling vs (18th)'s flat cannot_fit_score. Top heuristics (1-2) integrate statistical measures (μ, σ, harmonic mean) and smooth exponential penalties to balance space utilization and fragmentation, while lower ones (11-17) use rigid thresholds. (7th) combines Worst Fit/Best Fit via item size classification, outperforming (18-20)'s non-adaptive strategies. Worst heuristics (18-20) fail to differentiate bins entirely.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize adaptive thresholds using bin statistics (mean, std), blend multiple objectives (residual minimization + fragmentation avoidance), and apply smooth exponential scoring. Avoid static thresholds and ensure dynamic item/bin context awareness.
