**Analysis:**  
Comparing **1st vs 7th**, the top heuristic uses adaptive logistic-weighted coefficient of variation to balance fit and density rewards, while the 7th relies on fixed thresholds and non-smooth step functions. Smooth exponential scoring and dynamic statistical blending dominate in better heuristics.  

**2nd vs 13th**: The 2nd introduces adaptive density rewards via z-scores and median-based thresholds, whereas the 13th-20th (identical) use static penalty factors and threshold clipping without contextual adaptability.  

**3rd vs 4th**: The 3rd balances residual minimization and fragmentation penalties via tanh-weighted coefficient of variation, while the 4th combines item-relative exponential rewards with less dynamic statistical normalization.  

**5th vs 10th**: Mid-ranked heuristics like the 5th/6th use item-size classification (small/large) with exponential scoring, while the 10th/11th apply fixed categorical tiers (tight/moderate/loose), which are less responsive to distribution shifts.  

**12th (worst)** simply returns zeros, ignoring feasibility and context entirely.  

Overall: Top heuristics excel through **adaptive statistical blending**, **smooth exponential scoring**, and **multi-objective prioritization** (e.g., residual minimization + density rewards), while lower-ranked ones suffer from fixed thresholds, non-smooth penalties, or lack of contextual adaptivity.  

**Experience:**  
Prioritize adaptive weights (e.g., coefficient of variation), blend residual/density objectives with smooth exponential scoring, use z-scores or logistic transitions for contextual adaptivity, and enforce feasibility with dynamic masking. Avoid fixed thresholds, step functions, or static penalties.
