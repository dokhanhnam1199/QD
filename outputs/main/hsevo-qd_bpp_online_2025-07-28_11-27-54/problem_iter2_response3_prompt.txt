Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Priority function using Best Fit strategy with negative diff scoring.\"\"\"\n    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    diff = bins_remain_cap - item\n    priority = np.where(valid, -diff, -np.inf)\n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Priority function that prefers bins leaving room for future items of the same size.\"\"\"\n    priority = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=np.float64)\n    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(can_fit_mask):\n        return priority\n    \n    remaining = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]\n    leftover = remaining - item\n    group_a_mask = leftover >= item\n    \n    # Indices for valid bins\n    valid_indices = can_fit_mask.nonzero()[0]\n    group_a_indices = valid_indices[group_a_mask]\n    group_b_indices = valid_indices[~group_a_mask]\n    \n    # Group A: prioritize bins with leftover >= item, prefer larger leftover\n    if len(group_a_indices) > 0:\n        leftover_a = leftover[group_a_mask]\n        priority[group_a_indices] = 1e6 + leftover_a  # Large base + leftover\n    \n    # Group B: best fit (prioritize smallest leftover)\n    if len(group_b_indices) > 0:\n        remaining_b = remaining[~group_a_mask]\n        priority[group_b_indices] = item - remaining_b  # Equivalent to best fit\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (13th-20th): The hybrid strategy (1st) adapts to item size (small/large) for dynamic prioritization, while the worst heuristics (zeros/random) lack discriminative logic. (2nd) vs (15th): Standard Best Fit (2nd) outperforms quantum-inspired variants (15th) by avoiding unnecessary complexity (e.g., sinusoidal noise). (3rd) vs (10th): Ratio-based scoring (3rd) and exponential weighting (10th) both prioritize tight fits but the former\u2019s simplicity aids stability. (6th) vs (7th): Secondary penalization of bin capacity (6th) improves over inverse residual scoring (7th) by balancing fit quality and bin density. (20th) vs (others): The niche strategy of reserving space for future items (20th) underperforms due to over-specialization. Overall: Top heuristics focus on **adaptive, mathematically grounded prioritization** of fit quality, while worst ones suffer from randomness, oversimplification, or excessive noise.\n- \n- **Keywords**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring, secondary tie-breakers, simplicity  \n- **Advice**: Prioritize dynamic context-driven thresholds (e.g., item size classification), mathematically smooth scoring (ratios, exponentials), secondary tie-breaking terms (e.g., underfill penalties), and minimalistic design.  \n- **Avoid**: Static thresholds, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), overcomplicated tie-breakers, and rigid priorities.  \n- **Explanation**: Dynamic adaptation ensures robustness across scenarios, smooth scoring enables gradient-based optimization, secondary terms resolve ties effectively, and simplicity reduces computational overhead while avoiding brittleness from fixed rules.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
