Keywords: Dynamic threshold anchors, non-smooth scoring, static consistency, primary-term focus  
**Advice**: Use fixed thresholds adjusted contextually, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), static priority rules, and emphasize primary objectives without secondary penalties.  
**Avoid**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring (ratios/exponentials), secondary tie-break terms, oversimplification.  
**Explanation**: Ineffective practices caused instability and overfitting. Anchored thresholds balance adaptability and stability. Non-smooth scoring aligns with discrete decisions. Static consistency reduces overhead. Primary-term focus streamlines decisions for complexity.
