Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores using adaptive item size classification and smooth scoring.\"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if len(bins_remain_cap) == 0:\n        return np.array([])\n    \n    # Dynamic item size classification based on harmonic mean of remaining capacities\n    eps = 1e-9\n    harmonic_mean = len(bins_remain_cap) / (np.sum(1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + eps)))\n    is_large = item > (harmonic_mean * 0.8)  # Adaptive threshold with margin\n    \n    # Smooth scoring with secondary tie-breaker\n    with np.errstate(divide='ignore', invalid='ignore'):\n        fit_ratio = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps)  # Primary term: fill ratio\n        underfill_penalty = bins_remain_cap - item  # Secondary term: leftover space\n        underfill_penalty = np.clip(underfill_penalty, 0, None)\n        \n        # Smooth exponential weighting of terms\n        fit_component = np.exp(fit_ratio * 2) * can_fit\n        penalty_component = np.exp(-underfill_penalty * 0.5) * can_fit\n        \n        # Adaptive strategy blending\n        if is_large:\n            score = fit_component * penalty_component\n        else:\n            # Prefer underutilized bins with smooth capacity scaling\n            capacity_scaling = bins_remain_cap / (bins_remain_cap.mean() + eps)\n            score = (1.0 + capacity_scaling) * penalty_component\n    \n    return np.where(can_fit, score, -np.inf)\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see adaptive dynamic classification significantly outperforms static zero-priority baselines; (3rd) vs (10th) highlights exponential smoothing over linear Best Fit improves fragmentation control. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), harmonic mean-driven thresholds adapt better than fixed ones. (5th) vs (3rd) reveals tie-breaker mechanisms (underfill penalty, capacity scaling) reduce residual waste. Comparing (11th) vs (20th) shows zero prioritization equals randomness. Comparing (3rd) vs (5th), dual strategy blending (Worst/Best Fit variations) paired with exponential decay dominates naive Best Fit.\n- \nKeywords: Dynamic threshold anchors, non-smooth scoring, static consistency, primary-term focus  \n**Advice**: Use fixed thresholds adjusted contextually, non-smooth scoring (e.g., step functions), static priority rules, and emphasize primary objectives without secondary penalties.  \n**Avoid**: Adaptive thresholds, smooth scoring (ratios/exponentials), secondary tie-break terms, oversimplification.  \n**Explanation**: Ineffective practices caused instability and overfitting. Anchored thresholds balance adaptability and stability. Non-smooth scoring aligns with discrete decisions. Static consistency reduces overhead. Primary-term focus streamlines decisions for complexity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
