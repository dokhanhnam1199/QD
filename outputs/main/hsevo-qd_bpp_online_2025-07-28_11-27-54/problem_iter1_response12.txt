To solve the **online bin packing problem (BPP)** effectively, we aim to minimize the number of bins used. In an online setting, where items must be placed *immediately upon arrival* without knowledge of future items, good heuristics like **Best Fit** perform well by choosing the best currently available spot.

Here’s a high-level description of the ** priority rule ** priority_v2 ** HE USES:

#### Strategy used: **Best Fit (with penalty for infeasible bins)**

- Compute **residual fit**, i.e., how well the item fits into the bin by evaluating `remaining_capacity - item_size`.
- Invalidate bins that cannot fit the item by giving them a very low (negative) score.
- For eligible bins, decrease non-completed gapactic cape*, i.e., smaller #ther$s$card „join lower collisionanske.

Here's a well-documented **Python implementation** snippetujemy

    """Best Fit with Nearest Appropriate Bin Selection
    
    Heuristic prioritizes the bin having smallest enough capacity to fit the current item,
    while rejecting unsuitable candidates severely (by assigning large negative scores).

    feasibility_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item                              # Valid bins turkeeping track transformerมาตร
