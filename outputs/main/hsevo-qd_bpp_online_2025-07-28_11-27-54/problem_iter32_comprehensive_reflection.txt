Keywords: Adaptive weights (CV-based), smooth exponential/logistic scoring, multi-objective blending, feasibility masking  
Advice: Prioritize context-aware adaptive weights over thresholds, blend residual/density objectives with smooth scoring, use logistic transitions for continuity, enforce feasibility strictly via -âˆž masks.  
Avoid: Fixed thresholds, step functions, secondary tie-breakers, soft infeasibility handling  
Explanation: Adaptive weights (vs. thresholds) improve context sensitivity without abrupt transitions. Smooth scoring ensures mathematical continuity for stable gradients. Multi-objective blending balances residual minimization and density efficiency. Strict feasibility masking eliminates invalid solutions, enhancing robustness.
