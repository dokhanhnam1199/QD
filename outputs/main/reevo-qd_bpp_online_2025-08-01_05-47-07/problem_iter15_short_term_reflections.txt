Prioritize valid options. Reward tightest fits, especially perfect ones, to minimize waste and efficiently close bins.
Leverage item/bin data. Prioritize tightest fits to minimize remaining capacity and overall waste.
Prioritize valid fits, perfect matches, and tightest remaining space to optimize bin utilization.
Prioritize valid options. Implement strategies (e.g., Best-Fit) to optimize resource utilization based on clear criteria.
Strategically prioritize, avoid dead space, and achieve perfect fits using Best Fit principles.
Prioritize tight fits (Best-Fit). Discourage opening new bins unless necessary to consolidate items.
Prioritize valid, tight fits; give strong bonus for perfect fits to maximize bin utilization.
Utilize item and bin sizes to quantify fit. Exclude invalid options. Prioritize tightest fits.
Prioritize tight fits, avoid small fragments, and consolidate items in existing bins.
Reward perfect fits highly, then minimize remaining capacity. Filter out non-fitting bins.
