Prioritize valid choices. Leverage problem-specific data to optimize item placement (e.g., tightest fit).
Design priority around minimizing wasted space: prefer perfect fits, then tightest fit.
Define clear preferences: prioritize perfect fits, then tight fits. Penalize invalid options.
Strategically prioritize: perfect fit, avoid small fragments, then best fit. Tune parameters for waste reduction.
Greedily minimize wasted space by prioritizing tight fits and perfect fits, avoiding invalid placements.
Incorporate problem data and a strategic objective (e.g., tight fit) into priority scores.
Leverage problem data (item, bin state) for strategic choices to minimize wasted space.
Prioritize actions leveraging problem constraints and optimizing for the objective function in your heuristic design.
Utilize problem-specific data and objectives. Apply established greedy strategies, filtering invalid options for effective choices.
Prioritize tight fits (Best-Fit) and consolidate items into existing bins to minimize new bin openings.
