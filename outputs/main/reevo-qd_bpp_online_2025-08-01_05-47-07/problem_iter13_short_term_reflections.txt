Prioritize perfect fits, then minimize remaining bin capacity (Best Fit). Exclude non-fitting options.
Leverage all available data. Prioritize optimal fits (e.g., perfect matches) and minimize wasted bin space.
Prioritize optimal outcomes (e.g., perfect fits) by leveraging problem data and minimizing wasted space.
Prioritize specific outcomes (perfect, best-fit) to reduce waste, unlike uniform arbitrary choices.
Prioritize tight fits, reward perfect fits. Effectively utilize item and bin remaining capacity information.
Prioritize perfect fits, then minimal remaining capacity. Leverage all problem-specific properties.
Utilize item/bin data to prioritize valid, strategic fits (e.g., tightest fit).
Leverage item-bin properties (e.g., fit). Apply effective heuristics. Refine priorities for specific optimization goals.
Prioritize tightest fits (Best-Fit) and strongly reward perfect bin utilization for efficiency.
Prioritize tight fits, minimize fragmentation, encourage bin consolidation, and use tunable parameters for effective heuristics.
