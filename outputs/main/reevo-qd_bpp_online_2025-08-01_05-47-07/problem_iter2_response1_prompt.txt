BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This strategy, 'Targeted Remaining Capacity Fit', aims to find a bin\n    such that after placing the item, the bin's remaining capacity (slack)\n    is as close as possible to a predefined 'target slack'.\n    \n    The 'target slack' is defined as a small fraction of the item's size.\n    This heuristic attempts to balance two objectives:\n    1.
