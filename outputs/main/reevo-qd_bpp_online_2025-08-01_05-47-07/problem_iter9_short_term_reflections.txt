Utilize item and bin capacities to prioritize tightest fits, minimizing remaining space effectively.
Utilize input data to assess feasibility and prioritize strategic, tightest fits.
Prioritize perfect and tight fits. Reward full utilization, penalize wasted space. Avoid arbitrary choices.
Prioritize best fit, strongly reward perfect fits to minimize resulting wasted space.
Evaluate item-bin fit. Prioritize perfect fits, then tightest fits. Discard impossible placements.
Prioritize perfect fits. Penalize unusable small remnants. Prefer tighter useful fits.
Prioritize strategic fits (perfect, tightest) to minimize waste. Reward desirable states, penalize inefficient ones.
Consider item fit; prioritize options minimizing remaining capacity for tighter packing.
Leverage problem-specific data for strategic objectives (e.g., tightest fit); ensure constraints are met.
Differentiate choices by outcome quality. Prioritize ideal fits, penalize bad fragments. Consider future state.
