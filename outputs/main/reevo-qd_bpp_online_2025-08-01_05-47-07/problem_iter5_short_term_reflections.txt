Prioritize valid options based on item fit and resulting bin state for strategic choices.
Ensure item fits. Prioritize choices based on objective (e.g., tightest fit or minimal waste).
Prioritize feasible options using all available data to guide informed greedy choices like Best Fit.
Analyze future bin states: reward perfect fits, penalize small fragments, optimize remaining space.
Evaluate choices by their impact on resource utilization, applying domain-specific criteria instead of arbitrary selection.
Strategic scoring: Maximize perfect fits, minimize unusable fragments, optimize future bin states.
Optimize future bin states: prioritize perfect fits, penalize small fragments, use strategic thresholds.
Prioritize tight fits to minimize waste. Explicitly exclude invalid placement options.
Utilize problem data and constraints to define and optimize a clear objective for bin selection.
Strategize remaining capacity: Prioritize full bins and avoid creating small, unusable fragments.
