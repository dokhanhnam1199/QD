Calculate item-bin interactions and consequences. Optimize future bin state to minimize overall waste.
Simpler, direct objectives (e.g., minimizing remaining space) often outperform complex, parameterized "target" heuristics.
Prioritize minimizing remaining space directly. Complex slack targets often underperform online.
Prioritize tightest fits (Best Fit) to maximize bin utilization; avoid arbitrary slack.
Prioritize minimal remaining space (Best Fit). Use subtle secondary biases (e.g., positional) for tie-breaking and closing bins.
Prioritize choices that optimize immediate resource utilization by minimizing waste.
Maximize bin utilization by minimizing remaining space; simple Best Fit often outperforms arbitrary target slack.
Simpler heuristics, like direct space minimization (Best Fit), often outperform complex target-based strategies.
Leverage item and bin properties to prioritize decisions, aiming for tighter fits and efficiency.
Prioritize direct space minimization (Best Fit). Complex, item-dependent slack targets often reduce overall packing efficiency.
