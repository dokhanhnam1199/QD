Leverage problem data to optimize for objectives (e.g., minimize waste); handle infeasible options.
Always check feasibility. Strategically prioritize bins based on how they impact future packing (e.g., tightest fit).
Always ensure item fits. Prioritize choices that leave the least remaining space in the selected bin.
Leverage problem-specific information for goal-driven, informed decisions.
Strategically manage remaining capacity: prioritize perfect fits, avoid small, unusable fragments, and prefer tighter fits.
Analyze item/bin data for strategic fits. Prioritize tightest fits; exclude invalid options.
*   Quantify choices distinctly.
*   Prioritize ideal outcomes (e.g., perfect fits).
*   Apply secondary criteria (e.g., Best Fit) otherwise.
Utilize problem-specific information to define strategic priorities, rewarding desired outcomes like perfect fits or minimal remaining space.
Utilize item and bin information to strategically prioritize tightest fits, minimizing remaining capacity and filtering invalid bins.
Leverage problem state to prioritize feasible options aligning with the optimization objective.
