{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n    This version prioritizes savings and inverse distance, simplifies depot proximity, and adjusts the sparsification threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (shape: n by n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Customer demands (shape: n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n by n).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n\n    # Calculate savings matrix (Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm)\n    savings_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            savings_matrix[i, j] = distance_matrix[0, i] + distance_matrix[0, j] - distance_matrix[i, j]\n            savings_matrix[j, i] = savings_matrix[i, j]\n\n    # Demand factor\n    normalized_demands = demands / np.max(demands)  # Normalize demand for better scaling\n    demand_penalty = 1 + 1.5 * (normalized_demands[:, None] + normalized_demands[None, :])  # Creates a demand penalty matrix, reduced penalty\n\n    # Combine factors\n    inverse_distance = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-9)  # Avoid division by zero\n\n    heuristics_matrix = savings_matrix * inverse_distance / demand_penalty\n\n    # Encourage connection to depot, with smaller weight\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        heuristics_matrix[0, i] *= 1.1  # Slightly favor connections to the depot\n        heuristics_matrix[i, 0] *= 1.1\n\n    # Sparsify the matrix adaptively, adjusted percentile\n    threshold = np.percentile(heuristics_matrix[heuristics_matrix > 0], 50)  # Adaptive threshold, increased percentile\n    heuristics_matrix[heuristics_matrix < threshold] = 0.0\n\n    # Normalize the heuristics matrix\n    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristics_matrix)\n    if max_heuristic > 0:\n        heuristics_matrix = heuristics_matrix / max_heuristic\n\n    return heuristics_matrix\n\n[Better code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n    This version prioritizes savings and inverse distance.
