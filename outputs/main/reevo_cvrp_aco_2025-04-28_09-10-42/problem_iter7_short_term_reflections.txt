Focus on depot proximity, demand ratio, and targeted sparsification using distance and heuristics scores.

Directly combining savings, inverse distance, and demand penalty matrices improves performance. Adaptive sparsification is also beneficial.

Savings, depot proximity, demand ratios, and adaptive distance thresholds yield better edge prioritization.

Savings, angles, and adaptive sparsification are beneficial. Explicitly penalize over-capacity edges more.

Savings, inverse distance are key. Simplify depot proximity, demand, and sparsify based on distance.

Savings calculations, demand penalties, adaptive sparsification, and normalization improved heuristic quality.

Savings, demand ratios, adaptive sparsification, and distance thresholds improve edge selection for CVRP heuristics.

Prioritize savings, refine depot proximity/demand factors, and tune sparsification thresholds for better performance.

Savings calculation, depot proximity, demand ratio, adaptive sparsification, and normalization improve edge selection.

Savings, depot proximity, and demand ratios improve heuristics. Sparsification via distance and score boosts performance.
