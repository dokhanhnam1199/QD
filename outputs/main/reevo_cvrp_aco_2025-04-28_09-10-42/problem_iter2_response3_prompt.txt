Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)\n    via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    This version incorporates distance, demand, and angular considerations\n    to determine the desirability of including an edge in the solution.\n    It also sparsifies the matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix: A numpy array of shape (n, n) representing the distance\n                         between each pair of nodes.\n        coordinates: A numpy array of shape (n, 2) representing the Euclidean\n                     coordinates of each node.\n        demands: A numpy array of shape (n,) representing the demand of each node.\n        capacity: An integer representing the capacity of each vehicle.\n\n    Returns:\n        A numpy array of shape (n, n) representing the prior indicators of how\n        promising it is to include each edge in a solution.
