{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix (shape: n by n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (shape: n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (same shape as distance_matrix).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Parameters (can be tuned)\n    alpha = 1.0  # Weight for distance\n    beta = 0.5   # Weight for demand consideration (higher demand makes edge less attractive)\n    gamma = 0.2  # Weight for angle to depot (edges pointing away from depot are less attractive)\n    sparsity_threshold = 0.1 # Edges with a value less than this gets pruned\n\n    depot_coords = coordinates[0]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0  # No self-loops\n            else:\n                # Distance factor: Shorter distances are more promising\n                distance_factor = alpha / distance_matrix[i, j]\n\n                # Demand factor:  Edges connecting nodes with high demand are penalized\n                demand_factor = 1 / (1 + beta * (demands[i] + demands[j]))\n\n                # Angle to depot factor: Edges connecting nodes far away from the depot might be suboptimal.\n                # We calculate the angle between the edge (i, j) and the line connecting node i to the depot.\n                # Larger angles (closer to 180 degrees) indicate the route is going away from the depot\n                vector_ij = coordinates[j] - coordinates[i]\n                vector_i_depot = depot_coords - coordinates[i]\n\n                # Handle cases when node i is close to the depot to avoid division by zero error\n                if np.linalg.norm(vector_i_depot) < 1e-6: # If i == depot, all outgoing edges have angle=0, avoid inf\n                    angle_factor = 1.0\n                else:\n                    dot_product = np.dot(vector_ij, vector_i_depot)\n                    magnitudes = np.linalg.norm(vector_ij) * np.linalg.norm(vector_i_depot)\n\n                    #Avoid NaN if nodes are very close to each other.\n                    if magnitudes < 1e-6:\n                        angle_factor = 1.0 #Set to highest angle factor to allow exploring.\n                    else:\n                         cos_angle = dot_product / magnitudes\n                         cos_angle = np.clip(cos_angle, -1.0, 1.0)\n                         angle = np.arccos(cos_angle)\n\n                         # Penalize edges with large angles\n                         angle_factor = 1 - gamma * (angle / np.pi) # Normalise between 0 and 1\n\n                # Combine the factors\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = distance_factor * demand_factor * angle_factor\n\n    # Sparsify the matrix: Remove edges with low heuristic values\n    max_val = np.max(heuristic_matrix)\n    threshold = sparsity_threshold * max_val  # Dynamic threshold based on the max value\n\n    heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < threshold] = 0\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\n[Better code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    This version incorporates several factors to assess the promise of including each edge\n    in a solution and sparsifies the matrix.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    promise = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Heuristic factors:\n    # 1.
