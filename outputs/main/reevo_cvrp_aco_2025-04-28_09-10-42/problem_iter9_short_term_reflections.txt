Simpler normalization, direct factor integration, and aggressive sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Simpler depot proximity, adjusted sparsification, and no isolated depot proximity are key improvements.

Better version: Pairwise depot proximity, different demand penalty, and sparsification thresholds improved performance.

Targeted sparsification (per-node), normalized depot proximity, and demand ratio adjustment improve heuristic quality.

Savings, inverse distance, and demand considerations, with adaptive sparsification, yield better heuristic guidance.

Better code: Improved depot proximity, demand handling, and distance sparsification led to performance gains.

Simpler depot proximity, demand normalization, and adaptive sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Prioritize depot proximity and demand. Sparsify based on distance. Fine-tune weights through experimentation.

Refine factor weighting, depot proximity, demand influence, and adaptive distance thresholds for improved heuristic design.

Targeted sparsification and depot proximity normalization improve heuristic quality.
