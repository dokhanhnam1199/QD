    """
    Heuristics function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.
    This version further refines factor weighting, adaptive thresholds, and proximity/demand influence for improved heuristic design.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (shape: n by n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Customer demands (shape: n).
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n by n).
