Sparsification, refined demand handling, and depot angle calculation improve heuristic quality.

Angles, demand ratios, and depot prioritization yield better CVRP heuristics than simple distance/demand ratios and proximity.

Savings calculations, normalization, and demand-based edge penalization yield a more effective heuristic. Sparsity also matters.

Savings calculation, depot proximity, demand ratio, and adaptive sparsification yield better heuristics.

The better code normalizes demand, uses absolute angle differences, and applies dynamic sparsification for improved performance.

Better code uses depot proximity, tunes weights, and sparsifies rows individually with a quantile threshold.

Better code prioritizes direct distance and demand interaction, omits normalization, and uses percentile-based sparsification.

Savings calculation and demand consideration are key. Sparsify based on a percentage.

The better code uses additive combination of factors and depot proximity for improved edge selection.

Prioritize diversification, angle calculation, and demand considerations with adaptive sparsity for better CVRP heuristics.
