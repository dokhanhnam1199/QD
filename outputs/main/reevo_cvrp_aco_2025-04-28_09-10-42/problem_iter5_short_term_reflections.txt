Prioritize savings and inverse distance; simplify depot proximity; adjust sparsification threshold.

Normalization, clustering encouragement, and adaptive sparsification contribute to better heuristic performance.

Savings calculation, depot proximity, demand normalization, and distance-based sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Prioritize proximity and demand jointly. Sparsify adaptively using percentiles for better edge selection.

Better heuristics use normalization, tunable parameters, sparsification, and customer clustering encouragement based on geometry.

Normalize inputs, penalize high-demand edges, and use percentile-based sparsification for better exploration.

Savings calculation, normalization, and aggressive sparsification improve heuristic performance in CVRP.

Better code: Normalization, harsher demand penalty, angle favoring, adaptive sparsification based on heuristic values.

Prioritize normalization, weighted combination of factors, and dynamic sparsification for better heuristics.

Sparsify based on percentile. Incorporate simple distance and demand factors effectively, avoid depot proximity and clustering.
