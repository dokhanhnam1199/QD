Refine factor weighting, adaptive thresholds, and proximity/demand influence for improved heuristics.

Combining distance and demand penalty, and adjusting sparsification thresholds improves heuristic quality.

Combining distance and demand penalty, and tuning sparsification thresholds improves heuristic quality.

Prioritize depot proximity and balance factor weights; normalize inputs; adaptively sparsify.

Explicit savings calculation, adaptive sparsification, and a subtle depot proximity bonus improved performance.

Focus on combined distance/demand penalties and adaptive sparsification based on percentiles and distance thresholds.

Prioritize savings, proximity, and demand, with adaptive thresholds and careful factor weighting.

Combine savings/distance, depot proximity, and demand ratio. Sparsify by distance and top edges per node.

Prioritize depot proximity and demand; target sparsification; penalize high combined demand.

Combining distance and demand penalty, and tuning sparsification thresholds improved performance.
