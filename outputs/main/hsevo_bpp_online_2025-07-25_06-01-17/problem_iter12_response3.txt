    An evolved priority function that incorporates dynamic weighting, forecasting, and problem state adaptation.
    
    Parameters:
    item (float): The size of the current item to be packed.
    bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.
    alpha (float): Weight for the current item's fit priority (default: 0.4).
    beta (float): Weight for the bin utilization priority (default: 0.3).
