```python

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the following rules:
    1. Bins with more remaining capacity are preferred.
    2. Among bins with the same remaining capacity, the one with the least absolute difference between the item size and the remaining capacity is preferred.
    3. If all else is equal, the bin with the lowest index is preferred.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the item size and the remaining capacity for each bin
    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
    
    # Calculate the priority score based on the remaining capacity and the absolute difference
    priority = bins_remain_cap - 0.01 * diff
