**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a more complex calculation involving dynamic weighting, shortfall, and excess capacity, whereas the worst heuristic uses a simpler calculation with a fixed weighting factor. 
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see that the second-best heuristic introduces a balance factor and forecasting, while the second-worst heuristic lacks these features. 
Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), we see that the third-best heuristic uses a combination of capacity difference, balance factor, and forecasting, whereas the third-worst heuristic relies solely on capacity difference and penalty factor. 
Comparing (4th) vs (17th), we see that the fourth-best heuristic incorporates multi-objective priorities with dynamic weighting and fragmentation priority, while the fourth-worst heuristic uses a simpler weighted difference calculation. 
Comparing (5th) vs (16th), we see that the fifth-best heuristic combines capacity difference, balance factor, and forecasting, whereas the fifth-worst heuristic uses a simpler calculation with a fixed weighting factor. 
Comparing (6th) vs (15th), we see that the sixth-best heuristic uses a combination of multi-objective priorities with dynamic weighting, while the sixth-worst heuristic lacks the dynamic weighting. 
Comparing (7th) vs (14th), we see that the seventh-best heuristic introduces a utilization priority, while the seventh-worst heuristic relies solely on capacity difference and penalty factor. 
Comparing (8th) vs (13th), we see that the eighth-best heuristic uses a combination of capacity difference, balance factor, and forecasting, whereas the eighth-worst heuristic uses a simpler calculation with a fixed weighting factor. 
Comparing (9th) vs (12th), we see that the ninth-best heuristic incorporates multi-objective priorities with dynamic weighting, while the ninth-worst heuristic uses a simpler weighted difference calculation. 
Comparing (10th) vs (11th), we see that the tenth-best heuristic uses a combination of capacity difference, balance factor, and forecasting, whereas the tenth-worst heuristic lacks the forecasting feature. 
Overall: Better heuristics tend to use more complex calculations, incorporate multiple objectives, and use dynamic weighting, while worse heuristics rely on simpler calculations with fixed weighting factors.

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by combining multiple objectives, using dynamic weighting, and incorporating forecasting and fragmentation priorities.
