Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines multi-objective priorities with dynamic weighting.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size\n    capacity_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Invert the differences to obtain a priority score for the current item's fit\n    fit_priority = 1 / (1 + capacity_diff)\n    \n    # If the item size exceeds the remaining capacity, set the priority to 0\n    fit_priority[bins_remain_cap < item] = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the shortfall or excess capacity for each bin\n    shortfall = np.maximum(0, item - bins_remain_cap)\n    excess = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Calculate a penalty factor for each bin based on the shortfall or excess capacity\n    penalty_factor = 1 / (1 + np.exp(shortfall)) * 1 / (1 + np.exp(excess))\n    \n    # Calculate the bin utilization, considering both the current item and future potential\n    avg_historic_size = np.mean(bins_remain_cap)  # Using mean remaining capacity as a proxy for historic item sizes\n    utilization_priority = (bins_remain_cap + avg_historic_size) / (bins_remain_cap + item + avg_historic_size)\n    \n    # Calculate the overall priority, balancing the current item's fit and bin utilization\n    priority = alpha * fit_priority + beta * utilization_priority + (1 - alpha - beta) * penalty_factor * bins_remain_cap\n    \n    # Ensure the priority scores are not NaN (e.g., due to division by zero)\n    priority = np.nan_to_num(priority)\n    \n    # Assign high priority to bins with enough capacity and a good fit\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, priority, -1)\n    \n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with useful advice:\n* Keywords: adaptive, multi-objective, dynamic\n* Advice: Consider adaptive weighting, multi-objective optimization, and dynamic prioritization\n* Avoid: simplistic balancing, over-emphasis on tight fits, static prioritization\n* Explanation: By incorporating adaptive and dynamic elements, heuristics can better respond to changing problem conditions, leading to more effective optimization solutions.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
