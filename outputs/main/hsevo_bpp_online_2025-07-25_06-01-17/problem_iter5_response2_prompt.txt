Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function is designed to improve upon the previous version by \n    considering multiple objectives, prioritizing efficient placements, and \n    anticipating future items.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        all_items: Optional array of all items (including future ones) for forecasting.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size\n    capacity_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Invert the differences to obtain a priority score (lower difference -> higher priority)\n    priority = 1 / (1 + capacity_diff)\n    \n    # If the item size exceeds the remaining capacity, set the priority to 0\n    priority[bins_remain_cap < item] = 0\n    \n    # Introduce a 'balance' factor to prioritize bins with remaining capacity close to 50% of the bin size\n    balance_factor = 1 - np.abs((bins_remain_cap - item) / (bins_remain_cap + item))\n    priority *= balance_factor\n    \n    # If all items are provided, consider forecasting future items to anticipate constraints\n    if all_items is not None:\n        future_items = all_items[all_items > item]\n        forecast_factor = 1 / (1 + np.sum(future_items))\n        priority *= forecast_factor\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines elements of v0 and v1 heuristics for better outcomes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the shortfall or excess capacity for each bin\n    shortfall = np.maximum(0, item - bins_remain_cap)\n    excess = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Calculate a penalty factor for each bin based on the shortfall or excess capacity\n    penalty_factor = penalty_factor_weight / (1 + np.exp(shortfall)) * penalty_factor_weight / (1 + np.exp(excess))\n    \n    # Assign high priority to bins with enough capacity and a good fit\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, bins_remain_cap * penalty_factor, -1)\n    \n    # Ensure bins with higher remaining capacity get higher priority when the item fits\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, priority + capacity_weight * bins_remain_cap, priority)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing 1st vs 20th, we see that the best heuristic considers multiple objectives (capacity difference, balance factor, and forecasting) to prioritize bins, while the worst heuristic only combines balance and forecasting without considering the capacity difference. \nComparing 2nd vs 19th, we see that the second-best heuristic also considers multiple objectives, but with a different approach to calculating the priority scores. \nComparing 3rd vs 18th, we see that the third-best heuristic uses weighted factors to combine different priorities, while the 18th heuristic uses a simpler approach to combine priorities. \nOverall: Better heuristics consider multiple objectives, use weighted factors, and have a more sophisticated approach to calculating priority scores.\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics:\n* **Keywords**: Multi-objective, weighted factors, balance\n* **Advice**: Incorporate dynamic weighting, consider trade-offs, and prioritize flexibility\n* **Avoid**: Overemphasizing tight fits, myopic focus on single objectives\n* **Explanation**: By considering multiple objectives and using adaptive weighting, heuristics can effectively balance competing priorities and adapt to changing problem landscapes.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
