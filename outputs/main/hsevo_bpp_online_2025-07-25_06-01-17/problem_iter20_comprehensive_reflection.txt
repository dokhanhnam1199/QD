Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with advice to design better heuristics:
* Keywords: adaptive, nuanced, balanced, multi-objective
* Advice: Incorporate machine learning, consider problem constraints, and use iterative refinement
* Avoid: Oversimplification, static weighting, single-objective focus
* Explanation: Design heuristics that adapt to problem dynamics, balance competing objectives, and iteratively refine solutions to achieve optimal outcomes.
