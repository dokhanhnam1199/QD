    An advanced priority function for online Bin Packing Problem, incorporating adaptive weighting, 
    multiple objectives, and nuanced problem state assessment.

    Parameters:
    item (float): The size of the current item to be packed.
    bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): The remaining capacities of the bins.
    alpha (float): Weight for the fit priority (default: 0.4).
    beta (float): Weight for the utilization priority (default: 0.3).
    gamma (float): Weight for the penalty factor (default: 0.3).

    Returns:
    np.ndarray: Priority scores for each bin.
