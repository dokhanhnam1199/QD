Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with key points:
* **Keywords**: Adaptive weighting, multiple objectives, complexity, nuance
* **Advice**: Consider diverse factors, prioritize adaptability, and balance competing objectives
* **Avoid**: Overemphasizing tight fits, oversimplifying problem states
* **Explanation**: Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to problem complexities, incorporating multiple perspectives to ensure robust and effective optimization solutions.
