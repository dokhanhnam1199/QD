Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd) is identical to (1st), suggesting redundancy. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that (3rd) uses a more complex formula for calculating the penalty factor, while (4th) uses a simpler approach. (5th) introduces additional weights and factors, increasing complexity. (6th) and (7th) are similar to (4th) and (3rd), respectively. (8th) to (15th) have similar structures, with variations in weight calculation and prioritization. (16th) to (19th) introduce new factors, such as waste and tight fit, while (20th) is similar to (19th). Overall: the better heuristics tend to have more nuanced and adaptive weighting systems, while the worse heuristics have more straightforward, simplistic approaches.\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with key points:\n* **Keywords**: Adaptive weighting, multiple objectives, complexity, nuance\n* **Advice**: Consider diverse factors, prioritize adaptability, and balance competing objectives\n* **Avoid**: Overemphasizing tight fits, oversimplifying problem states\n* **Explanation**: Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to problem complexities, incorporating multiple perspectives to ensure robust and effective optimization solutions.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
