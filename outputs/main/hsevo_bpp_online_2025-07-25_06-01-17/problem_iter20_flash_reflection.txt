**Analysis:**
Comparing the 1st heuristic vs the 20th heuristic, we see that the 1st heuristic uses a more nuanced approach to calculating the priority score, incorporating both the item's fit and the bin's utilization, whereas the 20th heuristic uses a simpler inverse proportionality. Comparing the 2nd vs the 19th, we see that the 2nd heuristic introduces adaptive weighting based on the problem landscape, which is lacking in the 19th. Comparing the 3rd vs the 18th, we see that the 3rd heuristic incorporates a 'balance' factor to prioritize bins with remaining capacity close to 50% of the bin size, which is not present in the 18th. Comparing the 4th vs the 17th, we see that the 4th heuristic uses a more complex formula for calculating the penalty factor, whereas the 17th uses a simpler exponential decay. Comparing the 5th vs the 16th, we see that the 5th heuristic introduces a new objective of minimizing the number of bins used, which is not considered in the 16th. Overall, the better heuristics tend to use more nuanced and adaptive approaches to calculating priority scores, incorporating multiple objectives and factors.

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by incorporating nuanced calculations, adaptive weighting, and multiple objectives.
