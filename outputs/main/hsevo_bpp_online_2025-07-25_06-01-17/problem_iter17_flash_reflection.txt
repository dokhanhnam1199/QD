**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first heuristic combines multi-objective priorities with dynamic weighting, while the 20th heuristic also combines adaptive weighting and dynamic prioritization, but with a different approach to calculating priorities. (2nd) is identical to (1st), suggesting redundancy. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that (3rd) uses a more complex formula for calculating the penalty factor, while (4th) uses a simpler approach. (5th) introduces additional weights and factors, increasing complexity. (6th) and (7th) are similar to (4th) and (3rd), respectively. (8th) to (15th) have similar structures, with variations in weight calculation and prioritization. (16th) to (19th) introduce new factors, such as waste and tight fit, while (20th) is similar to (19th). Overall: the better heuristics tend to have more nuanced and adaptive weighting systems, while the worse heuristics have more straightforward, simplistic approaches.

**Experience:**
Use adaptive weighting and consider multiple objectives, prioritizing complexity and nuance for better heuristics design.
