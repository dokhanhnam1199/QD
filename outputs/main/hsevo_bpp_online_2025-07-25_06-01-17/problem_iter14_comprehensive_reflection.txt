Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics:
* Keywords: Adaptive weighting, multiple objectives, dynamic weighting
* Advice: Combine multiple objectives, use dynamic weighting, and incorporate forecasting
* Avoid: Prioritizing tight fits, overemphasizing future item placements
* Explanation: Effective heuristics balance multiple objectives, adapt to the problem's state, and use dynamic weighting to optimize solutions.
