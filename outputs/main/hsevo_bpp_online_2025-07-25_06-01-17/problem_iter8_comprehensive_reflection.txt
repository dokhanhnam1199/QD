Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with useful advice:
* Keywords: adaptive, multi-objective, dynamic
* Advice: Consider adaptive weighting, multi-objective optimization, and dynamic prioritization
* Avoid: simplistic balancing, over-emphasis on tight fits, static prioritization
* Explanation: By incorporating adaptive and dynamic elements, heuristics can better respond to changing problem conditions, leading to more effective optimization solutions.
