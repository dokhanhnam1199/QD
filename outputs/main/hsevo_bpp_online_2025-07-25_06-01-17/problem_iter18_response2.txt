    Combines adaptive weighting, multiple objectives, and nuanced considerations for improved bin packing priority.

    Parameters:
    item (float): The size of the current item to be packed.
    bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.
    alpha (float): The weight assigned to the item's fit priority (default: 0.4).
    beta (float): The weight assigned to the bin utilization priority (default: 0.3).
    gamma (float): The weight assigned to the penalty factor (default: 0.3).

    np.ndarray: An array of priority scores for each bin, considering the item's fit, bin utilization, and penalty factors.
