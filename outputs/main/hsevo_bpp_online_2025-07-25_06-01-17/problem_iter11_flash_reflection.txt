**Analysis:**
Comparing the 1st heuristic vs the 20th heuristic, we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of multi-objective priorities with dynamic weighting, while the worst heuristic uses a similar approach but with less effective weighting and prioritization. 
Comparing the 2nd heuristic vs the 19th heuristic, we see that the second-best heuristic introduces a 'balance' factor to prioritize bins with remaining capacity close to 50% of the bin size, while the second-worst heuristic lacks this factor. 
Comparing the 3rd heuristic vs the 18th heuristic, we see that the third-best heuristic uses adaptive weighting based on the problem's current state, while the third-worst heuristic uses a less effective adaptive weighting approach. 
Overall: the better heuristics tend to use more effective combinations of multi-objective priorities, dynamic weighting, and adaptive balancing, while the worse heuristics lack these elements or implement them less effectively.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics balance multiple objectives and adapt to the problem's state.
