Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with key points to design better heuristics:
* **Keywords**: Balance, Priority, Forecasting
* **Advice**: Consider multiple objectives, prioritize efficient placements, and anticipate future items
* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, narrow focus, and neglecting future constraints
* **Explanation**: By balancing competing factors, prioritizing tight fits, and considering future placements, heuristics can be designed to optimize outcomes and adapt to changing conditions.
