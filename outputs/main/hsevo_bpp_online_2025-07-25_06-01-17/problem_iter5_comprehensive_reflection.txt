Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' to design better heuristics:
* **Keywords**: Multi-objective, weighted factors, balance
* **Advice**: Incorporate dynamic weighting, consider trade-offs, and prioritize flexibility
* **Avoid**: Overemphasizing tight fits, myopic focus on single objectives
* **Explanation**: By considering multiple objectives and using adaptive weighting, heuristics can effectively balance competing priorities and adapt to changing problem landscapes.
