Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with key points:
* **Keywords**: Balancing, adaptation, weighted factors
* **Advice**: Design heuristics that adapt to problem states and balance multiple objectives
* **Avoid**: Prioritizing single factors, neglecting problem state changes
* **Explanation**: Focus on dynamic weighting and forecasting to create effective heuristics, avoiding rigid prioritization and incorporating problem state adaptation.
