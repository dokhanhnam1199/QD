Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function is designed to encourage the packing of items into bins \n    where the item size is close to the remaining capacity, thereby minimizing waste.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the difference between the remaining capacity of each bin and the item size\n    capacity_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Invert the differences to obtain a priority score (lower difference -> higher priority)\n    priority = 1 / (1 + capacity_diff)\n    \n    # If the item size exceeds the remaining capacity, set the priority to 0\n    priority[bins_remain_cap < item] = 0\n    \n    return priority\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with key points to design better heuristics:\n* **Keywords**: Balance, Priority, Forecasting\n* **Advice**: Consider multiple objectives, prioritize efficient placements, and anticipate future items\n* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, narrow focus, and neglecting future constraints\n* **Explanation**: By balancing competing factors, prioritizing tight fits, and considering future placements, heuristics can be designed to optimize outcomes and adapt to changing conditions.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
