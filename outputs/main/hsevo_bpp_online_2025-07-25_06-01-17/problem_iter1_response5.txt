def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to favor bins that have enough capacity to hold the item
    and penalize bins that are too full or too empty. The priority score is calculated as the 
    product of the remaining capacity and a penalty factor that decreases as the remaining capacity
    approaches zero or the item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    excess = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item)

    penalty_factor = 1 / (1 + np.exp(shortfall)) * 1 / (1 + np.exp(excess))
    
    # Calculate the priority score as the product of the remaining capacity and the penalty factor
