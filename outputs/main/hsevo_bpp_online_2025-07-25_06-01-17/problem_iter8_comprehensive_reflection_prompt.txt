{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDesign better heuristics by combining multiple objectives, using dynamic weighting, and incorporating forecasting and fragmentation priorities.\nDesign heuristics that consider multiple objectives and use weighted factors to combine priorities, ensuring a balanced approach to optimization problems.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics should balance multiple factors, prioritize tight fits, and consider future item placements.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
