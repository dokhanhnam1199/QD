Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Comparing the 2nd vs the 19th, we see that the 2nd heuristic introduces adaptive weighting based on the problem landscape, which is lacking in the 19th. Comparing the 3rd vs the 18th, we see that the 3rd heuristic incorporates a 'balance' factor to prioritize bins with remaining capacity close to 50% of the bin size, which is not present in the 18th. Comparing the 4th vs the 17th, we see that the 4th heuristic uses a more complex formula for calculating the penalty factor, whereas the 17th uses a simpler exponential decay. Comparing the 5th vs the 16th, we see that the 5th heuristic introduces a new objective of minimizing the number of bins used, which is not considered in the 16th. Overall, the better heuristics tend to use more nuanced and adaptive approaches to calculating priority scores, incorporating multiple objectives and factors.\n- \nHere's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' with advice to design better heuristics:\n* Keywords: adaptive, nuanced, balanced, multi-objective\n* Advice: Incorporate machine learning, consider problem constraints, and use iterative refinement\n* Avoid: Oversimplification, static weighting, single-objective focus\n* Explanation: Design heuristics that adapt to problem dynamics, balance competing objectives, and iteratively refine solutions to achieve optimal outcomes.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
