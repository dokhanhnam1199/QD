**Analysis:**
Comparing 1st vs 20th, we see that the best heuristic considers multiple objectives (capacity difference, balance factor, and forecasting) to prioritize bins, while the worst heuristic only combines balance and forecasting without considering the capacity difference. 
Comparing 2nd vs 19th, we see that the second-best heuristic also considers multiple objectives, but with a different approach to calculating the priority scores. 
Comparing 3rd vs 18th, we see that the third-best heuristic uses weighted factors to combine different priorities, while the 18th heuristic uses a simpler approach to combine priorities. 
Overall: Better heuristics consider multiple objectives, use weighted factors, and have a more sophisticated approach to calculating priority scores.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics that consider multiple objectives and use weighted factors to combine priorities, ensuring a balanced approach to optimization problems.
