**Analysis:**
Comparing the 1st heuristic vs the 20th heuristic, we see that the best heuristic prioritizes bins based on how full they are and how well the item fits, while the worst heuristic only considers the available space relative to the item size. The 2nd heuristic vs the 19th heuristic shows that the former favors bins with just enough capacity, while the latter prioritizes bins with enough capacity and higher available space. Comparing the 3rd vs the 18th, we see that the former assigns higher priority to bins with lower ratio of item size to remaining capacity, while the latter favors bins with enough capacity to fit the item. The 4th vs the 17th heuristic comparison reveals that the former uses a combination of remaining capacity and item size to calculate priority, while the latter acts as a First-Fit Decreasing heuristic. Overall, better heuristics consider multiple factors such as bin fullness, item fit, and available space, while worse heuristics rely on a single factor.

**Experience:**
Design heuristics should balance multiple factors, prioritize tight fits, and consider future item placements.
