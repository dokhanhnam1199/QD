    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to favor bins that have enough capacity to hold the item and 
    also prefer bins with the least remaining capacity, so the item can be packed tightly.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    bin_rates = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-6), 0)
