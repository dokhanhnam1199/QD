    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins with the least remaining capacity that can still accommodate the item.
    This helps in minimizing the number of bins used.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
