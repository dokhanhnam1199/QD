    A prioritization function for the online Bin Packing Problem, incorporating adaptive weighting and forecasting.

    Parameters:
    item (float): The size of the item to be packed.
    bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array of remaining capacities of the bins.
    alpha (float): The weight for the current item's fit (default: 0.4).
