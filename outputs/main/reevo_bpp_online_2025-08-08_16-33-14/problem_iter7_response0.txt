[Prior reflection]
Prioritize perfect fits, then tight ones. Penalize wasted space and over-packing. Tune thresholds, weights, and explore stochastically for improved bin packing.
The reflection suggests prioritizing perfect fits and tight fits, while penalizing wasted space. It also mentions tuning thresholds and weights, and the benefit of stochastic exploration. The current `priority_v1` seems to follow these principles.

To improve `priority_v1` based on this reflection:
1.  **Refine Thresholds:** The current thresholds (`item`, `3.0 * item`) are hardcoded. Ideally, these might be dynamic or related to the bin capacity or average item size. However, without more context on the problem instance (e.g., bin capacity, distribution of item sizes), these are reasonable starting points.
2.  **Tuning Weights/Decay Functions:** The weights (`1000.0`, `50.0`, `20.0`, `10.0`) and decay functions (`1/(1+x)`, `1/(1+sqrt(x))`, `1/(1+x/item)`) can be adjusted. The idea is that perfect fits are *much* better than tight fits, which are better than moderate, and wasteful fits are actively discouraged. The current structure seems to capture this hierarchy.
3.  **Stochastic Exploration:** The current `priority_v1` includes a small random jitter. This is good for exploration. We could potentially make this jitter more pronounced or strategic, but a small uniform jitter is a standard and effective approach.
4.  **Penalize Over-packing:** The prompt doesn't explicitly mention over-packing as a case within the priority function (since `bins_remain_cap >= item` is already filtered). However, if `bins_remain_cap` could become negative due to a bad heuristic choice prior to this function, we'd need to handle that. Assuming `bins_remain_cap` is always non-negative and the item fits.
5.  **Adaptive Thresholds:** The reflection mentions "adaptive thresholds." `priority_v1` attempts this somewhat by making `wasteful_threshold` dependent on `item` size. A more adaptive approach could consider the *distribution* of `bins_remain_cap` or the `item` size relative to the *bin capacity*. However, bin capacity isn't directly provided to the function. We only have `bins_remain_cap`. We can infer the *initial* capacity of a bin if we had the original `bins_capacity` array, but we don't.

Let's try to slightly adjust the scoring to make the "tight fit" penalty steeper and the "wasteful fit" penalty more severe, while ensuring the hierarchy remains. We'll keep the core logic but refine the constants and decay rates.

**Specific changes for `priority_v2`:**
*   **Perfect Fit:** Keep the highest score, perhaps slightly reduce the multiplier for more room for other categories.
*   **Tight Fit:** Make the decay function more aggressive (e.g., `1 / (1 + x^2)`) to strongly favor *very* tight fits over slightly less tight ones.
*   **Moderate Fit:** Make the decay less steep than tight, but still significant.
*   **Wasteful Fit:** Increase the penalty, perhaps making it more sensitive to the *amount* of wasted space relative to the item size.

Let's define `C` as bin capacity. If we assume a standard bin capacity (e.g., 1.0, which is common in normalized BPP), we could use that. Since we don't have it, we'll rely on `item` size and `remaining_after_fit`.

**Revised thought process for `priority_v2`:**
*   **Perfect Fit:** Max score. Let's keep it high but not excessively so. `100.0`.
*   **Tight Fit:** Remaining space `r` where `0 < r <= item`. Score proportional to `1 / (1 + k * r^2)`. A higher `k` means more penalty for larger `r`. Let's use `k=5`. Score: `80.0 * (1 / (1 + 5 * remaining_after_fit[tight_mask]^2))`.
*   **Moderate Fit:** Remaining space `item < r <= wasteful_threshold`. Score proportional to `1 / (1 + k * r)`. Let `k=1`. Score: `50.0 * (1 / (1 + remaining_after_fit[moderate_mask]))`.
*   **Wasteful Fit:** Remaining space `r > wasteful_threshold`. Score should be negative or very low. We want to actively avoid these. A penalty that grows linearly with `(r - wasteful_threshold) / item`. Let `wasteful_threshold = 2.0 * item` for a tighter definition of wasteful. Penalty: `- (10.0 + 15.0 * (remaining_after_fit[wasteful_mask] - wasteful_threshold) / item)`.

Let's try to implement this.

```
The `priority_v1` function implements a tiered approach: perfect fits get the highest score, tight fits get a good score inversely proportional to remaining space, moderate fits get a score that decays slower, and wasteful fits are penalized. The "wasteful" threshold is `3.0 * item`, and the penalty is designed to reduce the score as remaining space increases. A small random jitter is added for exploration.

The reflection asks for prioritization of perfect fits, then tight ones, and penalizing wasted space. It also mentions tuning thresholds and weights, and stochastic exploration. `priority_v1` already addresses these points.

For `priority_v2`, let's refine the scoring functions and thresholds to make the preferences more pronounced and the penalties steeper, as suggested by the reflection's emphasis on "perfect fits, then tight ones" and "penalize wasted space."

**Refinements for `priority_v2`:**
1.  **Tighter "Tight Fit" Definition:** Make the threshold for tight fits even smaller relative to `item`.
2.  **More Aggressive "Tight Fit" Scoring:** Use a steeper decay (e.g., quadratic) for tight fits, so very small remaining spaces are heavily favored over slightly larger ones within the "tight" category.
3.  **Stricter "Wasteful Fit" Threshold:** Make the threshold for wasteful fits lower.
4.  **Sharper "Wasteful Fit" Penalty:** Make the penalty more severe and potentially non-linear, increasing rapidly with the amount of wasted space.
5.  **Adjust Weights:** Re-balance the base scores for each category to maintain a clear hierarchy.

Let's assume a normalized bin capacity of 1.0 for scale. If `item` is large, `remaining_after_fit` can also be large.
The previous `priority_v1` used `tight_fit_threshold = item` and `wasteful_threshold = 3.0 * item`.
Let's try `tight_fit_threshold = 0.1 * item` and `wasteful_threshold = 1.5 * item`.

**Scoring adjustments for `priority_v2`:**
*   **Perfect Fit:** `100.0` (highest absolute score)
*   **Tight Fit:** `80.0 * (1 / (1 + 5 * remaining_after_fit^2))` (quadratic decay, favors very small remainders)
*   **Moderate Fit:** `50.0 * (1 / (1 + remaining_after_fit))` (linear decay)
*   **Wasteful Fit:** `-10.0 - 15.0 * (remaining_after_fit - wasteful_threshold) / (item + epsilon)` (starts with a negative base and becomes more negative linearly)
