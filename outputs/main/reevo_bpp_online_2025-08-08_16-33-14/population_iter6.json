Perfect Fit: Bin's remaining capacity is exactly zero after placement. Highest priority.\n    2. Tight Fit: Bin's remaining capacity after placement is small (<= item size). High priority, inversely proportional to remaining capacity.\n    3. Good Fit: Bin's remaining capacity after placement is moderate (> item size and <= 2 * item size). Medium priority, inversely proportional to remaining capacity.\n    4. Loose Fit: Bin's remaining capacity after placement is large (> 2 * item size). Lowest priority among fitting bins, but still offers a base score.\n\n    An exploration bonus is added to all bins that can fit the item to encourage\n    diversification and avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n\n    Args:\n        item: The size of the item to be packed.\n        bins_remain_cap: A NumPy array representing the remaining capacity of each bin.\n\n    Returns:\n        A NumPy array of the same size as bins_remain_cap, where each element\n        represents the priority score for placing the item in the corresponding bin.\n        Bins that cannot fit the item will have a priority score of 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Tolerance for floating-point comparisons, especially for perfect fits\n\n    # Identify bins that can accommodate the item\n    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    fitting_bins_indices = np.where(can_fit_mask)[0]\n\n    if not np.any(can_fit_mask):\n        return priorities  # No bin can fit the item, return all zeros\n\n    fitting_bins_caps = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]\n    remaining_after_fit = fitting_bins_caps - item\n\n    # Define scoring for different fit categories\n    perfect_fit_score = 100.0\n    tight_fit_base_score = 10.0\n    good_fit_base_score = 5.0\n    loose_fit_base_score = 1.0\n\n    # Thresholds for categorizing fits relative to the item size\n    tight_threshold = item\n    good_threshold = 2.0 * item\n\n    # Calculate scores for fitting bins\n    scores = np.zeros_like(fitting_bins_caps, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.
