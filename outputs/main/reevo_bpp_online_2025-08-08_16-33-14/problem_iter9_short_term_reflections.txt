Adapt thresholds and scoring to item size and bin state for better fits.
Penalize waste more, reward snug fits quadratically, adapt thresholds.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize waste, and adapt thresholds for better bin packing.
Prioritize perfect fits, then tight fits, and use a consistent decay for others.
Prioritize tighter fits, tune scaling factors, and consider a weighted combination of fit categories.
Prioritize perfect fits, use tiered scoring, and introduce controlled exploration.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize over-saturation, and optionally boost exploration.
Emphasize perfect fits, penalize waste, use adaptive thresholds.
Prioritize exact fits, then tight fits. Penalize excessive remaining capacity. Balance exploration and exploitation.
Tune thresholds, decay functions, and penalty factors for better fit prioritization.
