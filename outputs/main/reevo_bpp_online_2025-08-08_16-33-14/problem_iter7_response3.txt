[Prior reflection]
Prioritize perfect fits, then tight ones. Penalize wasted space and over-packing. Tune thresholds, weights, and explore stochastically for improved bin packing.

The reflection emphasizes prioritizing perfect fits, then tight fits, and penalizing waste. It also suggests tuning thresholds and using stochastic exploration.

Let's refine `priority_v1` to `priority_v2`:

1.  **Perfect Fits:** Maintain the highest priority.
2.  **Tight Fits:** Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity is small, especially those that are almost full. A decaying function is good, but let's ensure it strongly favors minimal remaining space.
3.  **Penalize Wasted Space:** This needs to be more aggressive. Instead of a linear penalty, perhaps an exponential or inverse relationship with the *efficiency* of the bin. Efficiency can be defined as `(bin_capacity - remaining_capacity) / bin_capacity`.
4.  **Threshold Tuning:** The thresholds for "tight" and "wasteful" could be more dynamic. For example, a "tight" fit could be relative to the item size *and* the current remaining capacity of the bin. A "wasteful" fit could be defined by a significant portion of the bin being empty *after* packing.
5.  **Stochastic Exploration:** The jitter is a good start. We can also introduce a small chance of picking a "suboptimal" bin to escape local optima.

Let's try to implement these. For this version, we'll focus on a more refined scoring based on "fit quality" and penalty for waste, and adjust the stochastic element.

**Refined Scoring Logic:**

*   **Perfect Fit:** `score = HIGH_PRIORITY` (e.g., 1000)
*   **Tight Fit:** Remaining capacity `r` is small. Score `s = A / (1 + r^2)` where `A` is a large constant. This heavily favors minimal remaining space.
*   **Good Fit:** Remaining capacity `r` is moderate. Score `s = B / (1 + sqrt(r))` where `B` is a moderate constant.
*   **Wasteful Fit:** Remaining capacity `r` is large. Score `s = C / (1 + r/item)` where `C` is a smaller constant, but we heavily penalize larger `r`. The penalty should reduce the score significantly.

A key aspect is defining "wasteful" more robustly. If a bin has `R` remaining capacity and we put an item of size `item`, the new remaining capacity is `R - item`. If `R - item` is large, it's wasteful. Let's consider the *efficiency* of the bin for the *current item*. If a bin has `R` remaining and we put `item`, the filled space is `item`, and `R-item` is empty.
The *efficiency* of this placement is `item / R`. We want to maximize this efficiency for bins where `R >= item`.
If `R-item` is very large, this efficiency can still be low.

Let's use a combined approach:
1.  **Perfect Fit:** Score = 1000.0
2.  **Near Perfect Fit (tight):** Remaining capacity `r` is small (e.g., `r < item * 0.2`). Score: `800 * (1 - r / (item * 0.2))`. This means close to item size is high, decreasing as `r` increases up to `0.2 * item`.
3.  **Good Fit (moderate):** Remaining capacity `r` is between `item * 0.2` and `item * 1.5`. Score: `400 * (1 - r / (item * 1.5))`. This penalizes larger gaps more slowly.
4.  **Slightly Wasteful:** Remaining capacity `r` is between `item * 1.5` and `item * 4.0`. Score: `100 * (1 - r / (item * 4.0))`. This applies a more significant penalty for larger gaps.
5.  **Very Wasteful:** Remaining capacity `r` is greater than `item * 4.0`. Score = `50 / (1 + r / item)`. This gives a very low score for large remaining gaps.

We also need to consider `bins_remain_cap` itself. A bin that is already almost full (large `bins_remain_cap` is small) is generally better.

Let's define thresholds based on item size and a small epsilon.

Thresholds:
*   `perfect_threshold = epsilon`
*   `tight_threshold = item * 0.3` (bins with remaining space < 30% of item size)
*   `moderate_threshold = item * 1.0` (bins with remaining space < 100% of item size)
*   `wasteful_threshold = item * 3.0` (bins with remaining space < 300% of item size)

Scoring functions:
*   Perfect: `1000.0`
*   Tight: `700.0 * (1.0 - max(0, r) / tight_threshold)` (linear decay to 0)
*   Moderate: `300.0 * (1.0 - max(0, r) / moderate_threshold)` (linear decay)
*   Wasteful: `100.0 * (1.0 - max(0, r) / wasteful_threshold)` (linear decay)
*   Very Wasteful: `50.0 / (1.0 + r / item)` (inverse proportional decay)

We also want to give a slight preference to bins that are already more full, independent of the item. Let's add a bonus proportional to `1 / (original_remaining_capacity + epsilon)`. We don't have original, but we can use current `bins_remain_cap` as a proxy for "how full it is".

Let's rethink: The goal is to minimize the number of bins. This means we want to pack items as tightly as possible.

**Revised Strategy for priority_v2:**

1.  **Perfect Fit:** Maximum priority.
2.  **Tight Fit:** Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity `r` is small *relative to the item size*, and also prioritize bins that are already mostly full.
3.  **Penalize Waste:** Assign very low scores to bins that leave a lot of empty space.

Consider the *quality of fit* for an item in a bin.
For a bin with `R` remaining capacity, and item `i`:
If `R < i`, it's unusable.
If `R == i`, it's a perfect fit.
If `i < R < i * (1 + alpha)`, it's a tight fit.
If `i * (1 + alpha) <= R < i * (1 + beta)`, it's a moderate fit.
If `R >= i * (1 + beta)`, it's a wasteful fit.

Let's use `alpha = 0.2` and `beta = 1.0`.
`tight_upper_bound = item * 1.2`
`moderate_upper_bound = item * 2.0`

We also want to encourage using bins that are *already* quite full. A bin that has `10` remaining capacity is generally more "valuable" to fill than a bin with `100` remaining capacity, assuming both can fit the item. So, we can add a bonus based on `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)` to bins that can fit.

Final approach:
For each bin `j` with `bins_remain_cap[j] >= item`:
Let `r = bins_remain_cap[j] - item` (remaining space after placing item).

Score calculation:
*   **Perfect Fit (`r < epsilon`):** `1000.0`
*   **Tight Fit (`r <= item * 0.2`):** `900.0 * (1.0 - r / (item * 0.2)) + 100.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`
*   **Good Fit (`item * 0.2 < r <= item * 1.0`):** `500.0 * (1.0 - r / (item * 1.0)) + 50.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`
*   **Wasteful Fit (`item * 1.0 < r <= item * 3.0`):** `200.0 * (1.0 - r / (item * 3.0)) + 10.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`
*   **Very Wasteful (`r > item * 3.0`):** `50.0 / (1.0 + r / item) + 5.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`

Add small random jitter.
Ensure scores are non-negative.

This approach assigns higher scores to perfect/tight fits and bins that are already full. It penalizes waste by giving progressively lower scores. The `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)` term acts as a "fill-up" bonus.
The thresholds are relative to the item size, making it somewhat scale-invariant.
Let's refine the scaling of these terms.

Revised Scores:

1.  **Perfect Fit (`r < epsilon`):** `1000.0`
2.  **Tight Fit (`r <= item * 0.2`):** `700.0 * (1.0 - r / (item * 0.2)) + 200.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`
3.  **Good Fit (`item * 0.2 < r <= item * 1.0`):** `400.0 * (1.0 - r / (item * 1.0)) + 100.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`
4.  **Wasteful Fit (`item * 1.0 < r <= item * 3.0`):** `100.0 * (1.0 - r / (item * 3.0)) + 20.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`
5.  **Very Wasteful (`r > item * 3.0`):** `20.0 / (1.0 + r / item) + 5.0 / (bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)`

The `epsilon` should be small, e.g., `1e-9`.
The `bins_remain_cap[j]` is the capacity *before* placing the item.

Let's consider the bounds. If `bins_remain_cap[j]` is very large, `1/(bins_remain_cap[j] + epsilon)` becomes very small. This is good, as it doesn't overly bias towards large empty bins.

Stochastic exploration: Add jitter `np.random.uniform(0, max_score * 0.05)`.
Make sure to clip scores to 0.
