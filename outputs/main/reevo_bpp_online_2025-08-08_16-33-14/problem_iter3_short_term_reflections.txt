Prioritize exact or near-exact fits. Avoid extreme values and numerical instability.
Favor tighter fits: prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing.
Emphasize **minimal leftover capacity** for better heuristic performance.
Prioritize bins that minimize remaining space for tighter packing.
Explore diverse strategies, balance exploitation and exploration for better performance.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing. Inverse distance offers better proximity.
Prioritize fits, then closeness to full. Softmax helps explore options.
Prioritize bins with minimal slack. Tailor function shape to desired fit.
Prioritize bins that leave less remaining capacity for future items.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize large surpluses. Handle infeasible bins explicitly.
