def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Implements an improved priority function for online Bin Packing Problem,
    prioritizing tight fits and using simpler, well-defined thresholds.

    The function assigns scores to bins based on how well they fit an item:
    1. Perfect Fit: Bin's remaining capacity is exactly zero after packing. Highest priority.
    2. Tight Fit: Bin's remaining capacity after packing is small (<= item size). High priority.
    3. Moderate Fit: Bin's remaining capacity after packing is larger than item size but not excessively so (<= 2 * item size). Medium priority.
    4. Loose Fit: Bin's remaining capacity after packing is large (> 2 * item size). Lowest priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.

    Returns:
        A numpy array of the same size as bins_remain_cap, where each element
        is the priority score for the corresponding bin. Higher scores indicate
        higher priority.
