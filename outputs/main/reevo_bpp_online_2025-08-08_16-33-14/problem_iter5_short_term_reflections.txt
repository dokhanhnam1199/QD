Consider stochasticity, combining multiple criteria, and fine-tuning weights for better results.
Categorize fits, weigh them, and add exploration for better online BPP heuristics.
Prioritize bins with *minimal* remaining capacity after placement, using a scaled inverse.
Prioritize perfect fits, then tight fits, and use thresholds to categorize other fits.
Prioritize tight fits, but penalize being *too* tight. Balance with exploration.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize very small remaining capacities. Categorize fits for nuanced scoring.
Experiment with score functions, thresholds, and explore randomization for better bin packing heuristics.
Prioritize tight fits, balance with leaving space, consider bin fullness, and use weighted sums.
Prioritize tight fits, encourage exploration, and strategically fill "almost full" bins.
Prioritize perfect fits, then tight fits, then good fits. Categorize fits for better scoring.
