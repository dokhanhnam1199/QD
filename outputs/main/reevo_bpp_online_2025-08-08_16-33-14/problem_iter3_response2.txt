[Prior reflection]
The goal is to improve the priority function for online bin packing by refining the hybrid strategy. The current `priority_v1` combines "Best Fit", an "Almost Full" heuristic, and a random exploration component.

Here are some areas for improvement based on the reflection:

1.  **Prioritize tight fits by minimizing leftover capacity**: The "Best Fit" component already does this by using `1.0 / (1.0 + remaining_after_fit)`. This seems reasonable. However, we could potentially penalize solutions that leave *too much* remaining capacity if the item is small and the bin is large, as this might be a wasted opportunity for a better fit.

2.  **Explore diverse bin selection strategies**: The current random component (`exploration_factor`) is a simple form of exploration. We could introduce more nuanced exploration, perhaps by favoring bins that haven't been chosen recently, or bins that have a certain amount of *slack* (remaining capacity greater than the item size but not excessively large).

3.  **Balance exploiting near-perfect fits with exploring options that leave room for future items**: The "Almost Full" heuristic attempts to exploit near-perfect fits. For leaving room, we could explicitly boost bins that have a "good" remaining capacity *after* fitting the item â€“ not necessarily the smallest remaining (best fit), but a capacity that is still substantial and might accommodate future items well.

4.  **Avoid numerical instability**: The current use of `1.0 / (1.0 + remaining_after_fit)` is generally stable as `remaining_after_fit` will be non-negative.

**Mutated Function Design (`priority_v2`)**:

*   **Refined Best Fit**: Instead of just minimizing remaining capacity, let's consider the *ratio* of remaining capacity to the item size. A small item fitting into a slightly larger capacity bin might be better than a large item fitting into a bin with just enough space, if the latter leaves very little room for anything else. Or, perhaps more simply, scale the best fit score by the *original* bin capacity to give preference to tighter fits in larger bins as well.
*   **Stochastic Exploration Enhancement**: Instead of a uniform random score, we could use a distribution that favors bins that are "moderately" filled or have moderate remaining capacity. This could be a more targeted exploration than pure randomness. Alternatively, we could introduce a decaying exploration rate over time or based on the number of bins used. For this specific mutation, let's try a different approach: favor bins that offer a "good but not perfect" fit.
*   **"Good Fit" Heuristic**: Introduce a new component that rewards bins where the remaining capacity *after* placing the item is still significant but not excessively large. This aims to leave room for future items. We can define "good fit" as having remaining capacity within a certain range, perhaps related to the item size or average bin capacity.
*   **Combining Scores**: Adjust weights to better balance the heuristics.

Let's try to implement the following:

1.  **Best Fit Refined**: Use `1 / (1 + remaining_after_fit)` as before, but perhaps add a term that slightly penalizes very large remaining capacities when the item is small. Or, a simpler modification: scale the best-fit score by the *original* capacity of the bin, giving priority to tight fits in larger bins as well.
2.  **"Good Fit" Exploration**: Prioritize bins where `remaining_after_fit` is positive and not too large, perhaps between `item` and `2 * item`, or a fraction of the original capacity. This encourages leaving "useful" amounts of space.
3.  **Modified Exploration**: Instead of uniform random, perhaps a slight boost to bins that are "average" fits, not the absolute best.

Let's focus on a more direct modification of existing components and introduce a new one that balances tight fits with leaving reasonable space.

**Revised Plan for `priority_v2`**:

*   **Best Fit (Tightest Fit)**: Keep `1.0 / (1.0 + remaining_after_fit)` for bins that allow a tight fit.
*   **"Good Enough" Fit**: Introduce a new heuristic that rewards bins that have *some* remaining capacity, but not necessarily the minimum. This could be defined as bins where `remaining_after_fit` is between `0` and `some_threshold`, where `some_threshold` is greater than `0` but not excessively large. This heuristic aims to leave useful space.
*   **Random Exploration**: A small additive random value to all *fitting* bins to maintain some level of exploration.

Let's try to combine these:
*   **Primary Score**: Best Fit (minimizing `remaining_after_fit`).
*   **Secondary Boost**: For bins that aren't the absolute best fit, but still offer a "good enough" remaining capacity (e.g., `remaining_after_fit` is positive but less than some fraction of the original bin capacity). This encourages leaving some usable space.
*   **Tertiary Randomness**: Small random noise.

Considering the reflection points:
*   "Prioritize tight fits by minimizing leftover capacity": Handled by Best Fit.
*   "Explore diverse bin selection strategies": Achieved through a combination of heuristics and randomness.
*   "Balance exploiting near-perfect fits with exploring options that leave room for future items": The "Good Enough" fit aims to address leaving room. Near-perfect fits are covered by Best Fit.
*   "Avoid numerical instability": Should be fine with current approach.

Let's define "good enough" remaining capacity. A simple approach could be: if `remaining_after_fit` is between `0` and `X * item` or `Y * original_bin_capacity`. Let's use a threshold relative to the *item size* to make it more adaptive.

Consider `remaining_after_fit` values for fitting bins.
If `remaining_after_fit` is `r_f`:
*   **Score Component 1 (Tight Fit)**: `1 / (1 + r_f)`. Higher for smaller `r_f`.
*   **Score Component 2 (Good Space Left)**: If `r_f` is within `(0, alpha * item]`, give a boost. Let's try `alpha=2`. So, if `0 < r_f <= 2 * item`.
*   **Score Component 3 (Exploration)**: Small random value.

Combining:
`priority = w1 * (1 / (1 + r_f)) + w2 * (boost_if_0<r_f<=2*item) + w3 * random_noise`

Let's try to implement this. The boost for "good space left" should be applied carefully. Maybe it's better to have distinct scores for different ranges of remaining capacity.

Let's try a different approach for `priority_v2`:

1.  **Best Fit**: Maximize `1 / (1 + remaining_after_fit)`.
2.  **Second Best Fit (Slightly Looser)**: Consider bins where `remaining_after_fit` is small but positive. This is implicitly covered by Best Fit, but we might want to give a slight advantage to bins that leave *some* room over those that are perfectly full.
3.  **"Sufficient Space" Heuristic**: Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity *after* fitting the item is still a significant portion of the *original* bin capacity, or at least sufficient to potentially fit another small item. E.g., if `remaining_after_fit > item`.
4.  **Exploration**: Add a small random noise.

Let's try a weighted sum where we assign different contributions based on the "quality" of the fit.

*   **Fit Quality Metric**: `remaining_after_fit`
*   **Bins**: Filter to those that can fit the item.
*   **Scores**:
    *   For the tightest fit (`min(remaining_after_fit)`): High score.
    *   For fits where `0 < remaining_after_fit <= threshold_1` (e.g., `item`): Moderate score.
    *   For fits where `threshold_1 < remaining_after_fit <= threshold_2` (e.g., `2*item`): Lower score.
    *   Add random noise to all fitting bins.

This seems to align with balancing tight fits and leaving room.

Let's simplify the "good fit" idea. Instead of a boost, let's have different scoring functions for different categories of `remaining_after_fit`.

Categories for `remaining_after_fit` (`r_f`):
1.  `r_f == 0`: Perfect fit. High priority.
2.  `0 < r_f <= item`: Tight fit. High priority, but less than perfect.
3.  `item < r_f <= K * item` (e.g., `K=3`): Moderate fit. Medium priority. Encourages leaving some room.
4.  `r_f > K * item`: Loose fit. Lower priority.

We can map these ranges to scores. The normalization needs care.

Let's try this structure for `priority_v2`:

```python

Let's refine the scoring. Instead of distinct additive scores, let's try to create a single function that maps `remaining_after_fit` to a priority, with different behaviors for different ranges.

Let's reconsider the scoring to make it smoother and more directly address the reflection points.
"Prioritize tight fits by minimizing leftover capacity." -> `1/(1+rem)` works.
"Explore diverse bin selection strategies." -> Randomness is one way. Another is to boost bins that are "good enough" but not necessarily the absolute best.
"Balance exploiting near-perfect fits with exploring options that leave room for future items." -> Need a score that rewards moderate remaining capacity.

Let's try a single score function based on `remaining_after_fit`, perhaps using a piecewise function or a smooth function that changes its behavior.

Consider a function `f(r)` where `r = remaining_after_fit`.
We want `f(r)` to be high for small `r`, moderate for medium `r`, and low for large `r`.

Let `r` be `remaining_after_fit`.
A function like `1 / (1 + r)` gives high score for small `r`.
To give moderate scores for medium `r`, we can use a different scaling or a piecewise approach.

How about:
`score = (1 / (1 + r)) * weight_tight + (function_for_medium_r) * weight_medium + random_boost`

Let's try to build upon `priority_v1`'s structure but adjust the "almost full" and "exploration" components.

Refined `priority_v2`:

1.  **Best Fit (Tight Fit)**: `1.0 / (1.0 + remaining_after_fit)` - strong priority for minimal leftover.
2.  **Good Fit (Leaving Space)**: If `remaining_after_fit` is positive but not minimal, aim to give a positive score. We want to reward bins that leave *some* room, perhaps up to `2*item` or `3*item`.
3.  **Exploration**: Instead of uniform random, perhaps bias towards bins that are not the absolute best fit. Or, simply add a small random value to all fitting bins.

Let's refine the combination strategy.
For bins that fit: `r_f = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`
*   **Score A (Tightness)**: `1.0 / (1.0 + r_f)`
*   **Score B (Space Left)**: If `r_f > epsilon` and `r_f <= 2 * item`, give a moderate bonus.
*   **Score C (Exploration)**: Small random value.

This `priority_v2` implementation attempts to address the reflection points by:
1.  **Prioritizing tight fits**: Uses `1.0 / (remaining_after_fit + epsilon)` as a base score for best-fit.
2.  **Exploring diverse bin selection**: Introduces a "Good Fit" heuristic (`good_fit_scores`) that rewards bins leaving a moderate amount of space (`epsilon < remaining_after_fit <= 2*item`). This provides an alternative to only picking the absolute tightest fit.
3.  **Balancing exploitation and leaving room**: The weighted sum combines the "tight fit" preference with the "good fit" preference. The "good fit" component specifically aims to leave room by scoring bins that aren't perfectly tight but offer reasonable residual capacity.
4.  **Avoiding numerical instability**: `epsilon` is used to prevent division by zero. Scores remain positive.

The weights (`0.7`, `0.3`) and the `good_fit_threshold` (`2.0 * item`) are tunable parameters. The random exploration is kept as a small additive noise.

Final check against reflection points:
- "Prioritize tight fits by minimizing leftover capacity." - Done by `best_fit_scores`.
- "Explore diverse bin selection strategies." - Done by `good_fit_scores` and `random_scores`.
- "Balance exploiting near-perfect fits with exploring options that leave room for future items." - Done by combining `best_fit_scores` (near-perfect) and `good_fit_scores` (leaving room).
- "Avoid numerical instability." - Done by `epsilon`.

This looks like a reasonable mutation.```python
