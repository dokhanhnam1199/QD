Tune thresholds, weights, and exploration strategy for better bin packing.
Prioritize perfect fits. Use item size for thresholds. Weight categories for nuanced scores.
Prioritize exact fits, then tighter fits. Penalize large remaining capacities. Explore randomly.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize over-full bins, and offer small bonuses for exact fits.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize near-full bins, and boost moderate remaining capacities.
Prioritize tight fits. Use simpler thresholds. Tune weights and exploration.
Categorize fits, use thresholds, and add exploration for better BPP heuristics.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize over-packing, use category-based scoring, and add exploration.
Prioritize tight fits, penalize wasted space, and use adaptive thresholds.
**Prioritize perfect fits, then tight fits. Add exploration for better results.**
