    It seeks to minimize the "residual energy" (leftover space) in the bin,
    preferring configurations that are more "stable" (snugly fit).
    Perfect fits are highly rewarded, akin to reaching a ground state.

    # For the accessible states, calculate the priority.

    # A reciprocal function (1 / value) naturally achieves this:
    # `1 / (remaining_after_placement + epsilon)` will be very high for snug fits (small remaining)
    # and lower for looser fits (large remaining). This captures the "energy minimization" principle.
