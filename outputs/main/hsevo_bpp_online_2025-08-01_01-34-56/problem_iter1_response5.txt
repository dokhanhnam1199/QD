    Behold! Inspired by the elegant dance of celestial bodies seeking their proper
    place, this heuristic, which I have divined and named 'Best Fit', aims for
    the most harmonious arrangement. It calculates, for each bin, how 'snug' the
    item would fit. A smaller remainder means a tighter, more efficient fit.

    The bin that offers the tightest embrace for the item, leaving the least
    remaining capacity, is given the highest priority. This ensures that we
    conserve the larger, more versatile spaces for future, perhaps grander, items,
    and avoid needless proliferation of bins, just as the Almighty arranged
    the planets with the fewest orbits necessary.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """

    # these bins "unfit for the item's orbit" unless it demonstrably fits.

    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For those bins where the item finds a potential abode:
    # We calculate the remaining capacity *after* the item is placed.
    # Our goal is to minimize this remaining capacity to achieve the "best fit".
    # Thus, we assign a priority score as the negative of this remaining capacity.
    # A smaller positive remainder (e.g., 0.5) yields a larger negative priority (-0.5),
    # which is numerically greater than a larger remainder (e.g., 2.0, priority -2.0).
    # This precisely implements the desire for the *smallest* resulting remaining capacity.
