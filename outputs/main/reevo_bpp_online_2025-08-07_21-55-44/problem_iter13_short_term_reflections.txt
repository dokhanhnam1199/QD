Adapt sigmoid steepness by fullness, incorporate lookahead boosts, deterministic tie‑breakers, penalize new bins, normalize slack.
Scale sigmoid steepness by fullness, normalize slack, reward lookahead fits, add tiny deterministic/random jitter, penalize infeasibility.
Use linear slack, avoid exponentials, tune lookahead weight, normalize capacities, small epsilon tie‑breakers.
Use dynamic steepness sigmoid, add exact‑fit bonus, incorporate lookahead, jitter tie‑breaker, normalise, clip for stability.
Prefer monotonic scores, simple exponential slack penalty, huge exact‑fit bonus, deterministic jitter, minimal hyperparameters.
Normalize slack, use logistic scaling, apply multiplicative look‑ahead, large exact‑fit bonus, random jitter, keep it simple.
Use adaptive sigmoid steepness, exact‑fit bonus, normalized slack, look‑ahead boost, and tiny jitter for tie‑breaking.
Prefer tight fits, normalize slack, exponential reward, big exact‑fit bonus, anticipate next item, tiny tie‑breaker.
Use vectorized ops, normalize slack, steepness scales with fullness, large exact‑fit bonus, multiplicative lookahead, random jitter for ties.
Prioritize negative waste, monotonic scores, tiny index tie‑breaker; avoid complex sigmoid, look‑ahead, random noise.
