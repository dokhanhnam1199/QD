Add exact fit bonus, prioritize minimal leftover, tie‑break by lower index, weigh items by size, penalize unused capacity.
Adjust sigmoid k to reflect bin fullness, normalize gaps, add tie‑breaking randomness, and consider lookahead item sizes.
Combine worst‑fit greed with softmax probabilities; tune temperature; penalize waste; consider bin‑opening cost.
Boost exact fits heavily; rank feasible bins by ‑slack; assign ‑inf to infeasible; use tolerance for floating‑point noise.
Prefer smallest waste (negative), mask infeasible bins, deterministic index tie‑breaker, use vectorized NumPy for speed.
Blend logistic fit and index; adapt k, center with bin count; penalize tight residuals; tie‑break by variance.
Prefer exact fits, minimize leftover, penalize infeasible, deterministic scoring, tie‑breaking, anticipate future items.
Use primary index ordering plus secondary fit tie‑breaker; scale secondary with epsilon; mask infeasible bins.
Prioritize minimal leftover, give massive bonus for exact fits, ignore index bias, handle floating‑point tolerance.
Normalize residuals, apply sigmoid/softmax, tune steepness, assign –inf to infeasible bins, add tiny jitter for ties.
