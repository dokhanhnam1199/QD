Give exact‑fit items a huge bonus; otherwise score bins by a monotonic decreasing function of normalized slack (linear or exponential). Penalize opening new bins proportionally to expected waste. Add a tiny deterministic tie‑breaker (index ε). Optionally include one‑step look‑ahead. Keep parameters few, avoid complex adaptive scaling.
