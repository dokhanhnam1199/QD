Give huge bonus for exact fits; else rank bins by –slack (minimal leftover). Mask infeasible bins (‑inf). Apply normalized slack with sigmoid/softmax, tune k/temperature. Add tiny jitter for ties, use index tie‑breaker, anticipate next item size, penalize bin opening and waste. Implement vectorized scoring for speed.
