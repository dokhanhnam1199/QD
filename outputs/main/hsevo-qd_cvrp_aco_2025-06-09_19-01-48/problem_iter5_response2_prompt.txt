Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics for CVRP based on distance, demand, and angle.

The better code also normalizes the heuristic matrix and uses adaptive sparsification.\n*   Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the trend continues where the superior code uses a more comprehensive approach with demand, angle, depot attraction, and sparsification, unlike the rudimentary inverse distance calculation in the inferior one.\n*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are the same. This suggests that the ranking isn't based on the code within this specific list since they are identical.\n*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see they are the same as 1st and 2nd.\n*   Comparing (16th) vs (20th), they are the same. This suggests that the ranking isn't based on the code within this specific list since they are identical.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics in this list are characterized by a multi-faceted approach, integrating distance, demand, angle considerations, and depot proximity into a combined heuristic matrix. Normalization and sparsification techniques are also crucial components, enhancing the effectiveness. The worst heuristics only consider distance.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's refine self-reflection for better heuristic design, aiming for effectiveness and actionable insights.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Factor Combination, Normalization Impact, Sparsification Rationale, Iterative Refinement Testing.\n*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each factor *before* normalization. Justify sparsification choices with problem-specific knowledge.\n*   **Avoid:** Blind simplification; always test the effect of removing or changing elements.\n*   **Explanation:** Analyze factor interactions and the impact of normalization choices on solution quality, sparsity justification, and rigorous component removal testing.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `heuristics_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
