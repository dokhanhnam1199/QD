- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I understand the goal: to refine the definition of "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics, while actively avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection." Let's break it down:

*   **Keywords:** Problem-specific knowledge, constraint awareness, normalization impact, iterative simplification, rigorous testing.

*   **Advice:** Focus on understanding *why* certain factors are relevant, and *how* constraints interact. Prioritize analyzing the effects of normalization choices. Test simplifications methodically.

*   **Avoid:** Vague "combining factors," blanket normalization without justification, premature sparsification, and refinement without rigorous impact assessment.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves deep problem understanding, critical evaluation of normalization techniques, and data-driven simplification. This ensures a more robust and adaptable heuristic design process.
