**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the top heuristic incorporates more factors (distance, demand, angle) and constraints (capacity) than the bottom one, which solely relies on inverse distance. The top heuristic also normalizes the heuristic matrix.

Comparing (2nd) vs (12th), (3rd) vs (13th)... all the way to (10th) vs (20th), we find the same pattern: the top 10 heuristics are identical and vastly superior to the bottom 10 heuristics, which simply return the inverse of the distance matrix.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th)... (9th) vs (10th), we see all top 10 heuristics are identical. This indicates that the ranking is based on some external factor not present in the code itself.

Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors beyond just distance, including demand and angles between nodes. They also incorporate capacity constraints and normalize the heuristic matrix. Simpler heuristics solely based on distance are less effective. Also, all of the first 10 heuristics are exactly the same and ranked the best.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and constraints. Normalization can be helpful. Start with a comprehensive approach, and then simplify if necessary, while rigorously testing the impact of each simplification. Different normalization methods could affect the overall performance.
