- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design.

*   **Keywords:** Rigorous testing, iterative simplification, multi-factor analysis, normalization impact, constraint awareness.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a feature-rich heuristic model. Systematically remove components, rigorously testing the effect on performance. Explore diverse normalization strategies to improve robustness.

*   **Avoid:** Premature simplification, neglecting constraints, inconsistent testing, overlooking normalization's influence.

*   **Explanation:** A structured approach of progressive simplification coupled with thorough testing reveals critical components and optimal configurations, leading to robust and efficient heuristics.
