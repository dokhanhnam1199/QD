- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, steering clear of the vagueness and pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." We need actionable, specific guidance.

Here's a revised approach focusing on *effective* self-reflection:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive parameters, Problem-specific features, Capacity constraints, Normalization impact, Rigorous testing.
*   **Advice:** Explicitly define "relevant factors" (e.g., criticality metrics, depot influence functions). Implement adaptive parameter tuning based on performance (e.g., reinforcement learning).
*   **Avoid:** Vague statements like "consider multiple factors" or "normalization can be helpful."
*   **Explanation:** Go beyond suggesting general ideas. Instead, prompt the designer to *define* and *quantify* key problem characteristics and to *test* specific adaptations rigorously. Focus on adaptive strategies, not just static inclusion of elements.
