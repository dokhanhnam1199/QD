**Analysis:**
Comparing (7th) vs (11th), we see the 7th heuristic incorporates "node criticality" based on demand relative to capacity and proximity to the depot, while the 11th only considers a combined demand penalty and depot discount. The 7th also discounts *to* the depot only, while the 11th discounts edges generally connected to the depot.  The 7th uses a more refined demand factor.

Comparing (16th) vs (11th), the 16th heuristic attempts to estimate *remaining* capacity when connecting nodes to the depot, offering a more nuanced capacity assessment than the 11th, which applies a simple combined demand check.  Also the 16th uses an average angle score from many potential previous nodes, while the 11th directly adds angle heuristic (without averaging). Also sparsification is missing from 16th.

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the 1st heuristic incorporates the depot attraction element which is missing from 11th. Also, the 1st favors low-demand edges.

Comparing (20th) vs (19th) vs (18th), all the same. And distance_matrix is used directly.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more problem-specific knowledge, such as node criticality and depot attraction, and use more nuanced capacity considerations. They also normalize the angle heuristic better or discount it in sensible ways.  Simpler heuristics rely on fundamental distance and demand penalties but lack refinement.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating problem-specific knowledge like node criticality and depot attraction. Refine capacity checks beyond simple combined demand and use normalization/averaging to reduce variance.
