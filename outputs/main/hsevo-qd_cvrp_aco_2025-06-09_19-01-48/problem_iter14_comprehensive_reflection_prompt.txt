{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDesigning effective CVRP heuristics requires balancing multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. Start with a strong distance-based foundation, then iteratively incorporate demand considerations, spatial relationships (angles, depot proximity), and adaptive mechanisms like sparsification. Carefully tune the weights and thresholds for each component.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and constraints. Normalization can be helpful. Start with a comprehensive approach, and then simplify if necessary, while rigorously testing the impact of each simplification. Different normalization methods could affect the overall performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating problem-specific knowledge like node criticality and depot attraction. Refine capacity checks beyond simple combined demand and use normalization/averaging to reduce variance.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple relevant factors and using adaptive parameter tuning. Normalization and sparsification are essential for efficient solution sampling. Pay careful attention to capacity constraints and depot proximity and include them into the heuristic.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors relevant to the problem. Normalize the results to ensure fair contributions from each factor. Employ sparsification to focus on the most promising options and improve computational efficiency. Start with a comprehensive solution, then iteratively refine based on performance feedback.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
