**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the better code incorporates multiple heuristics (distance, demand, angle, depot attraction, sparsification) while the worse code only considers inverse distance. The better code also normalizes the heuristic matrix and uses adaptive sparsification.
*   Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the trend continues where the superior code uses a more comprehensive approach with demand, angle, depot attraction, and sparsification, unlike the rudimentary inverse distance calculation in the inferior one.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are the same. This suggests that the ranking isn't based on the code within this specific list since they are identical.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see they are the same as 1st and 2nd.
*   Comparing (16th) vs (20th), they are the same. This suggests that the ranking isn't based on the code within this specific list since they are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics in this list are characterized by a multi-faceted approach, integrating distance, demand, angle considerations, and depot proximity into a combined heuristic matrix. Normalization and sparsification techniques are also crucial components, enhancing the effectiveness. The worst heuristics only consider distance.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors relevant to the problem. Normalize the results to ensure fair contributions from each factor. Employ sparsification to focus on the most promising options and improve computational efficiency. Start with a comprehensive solution, then iteratively refine based on performance feedback.
