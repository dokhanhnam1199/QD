- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine self-reflection for better heuristic design, aiming for effectiveness and actionable insights.

*   **Keywords:** Factor Combination, Normalization Impact, Sparsification Rationale, Iterative Refinement Testing.
*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each factor *before* normalization. Justify sparsification choices with problem-specific knowledge.
*   **Avoid:** Blind simplification; always test the effect of removing or changing elements.
*   **Explanation:** Analyze factor interactions and the impact of normalization choices on solution quality, sparsity justification, and rigorous component removal testing.
