**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates distance, demand, angle, depot proximity, capacity buffer, and adaptive sparsification, while the worst only uses inverse distance. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows the same contrast. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) has capacity buffer consideration. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see no differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: better heuristics incorporate multiple factors (distance, demand, angle, depot) and utilize techniques like normalization and sparsification. Adaptive parameter tuning is crucial.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple relevant factors and using adaptive parameter tuning. Normalization and sparsification are essential for efficient solution sampling. Pay careful attention to capacity constraints and depot proximity and include them into the heuristic.
