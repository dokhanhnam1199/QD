Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided heuristics and provide some guidance for designing better ones.

**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic incorporates "Node Criticality" and refines the "Demand-based penalty/reward" and "Adaptive Sparsification" strategies. The demand factor in the 1st heuristic gives increased reward; the 2nd does not. The 1st also uses a more aggressive sparsification (30% quantile vs. 25% quantile). The 1st also has Capacity Aware Depot Connection
Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (4th) vs (5th), the 5th heuristic removes the Depot Attraction form the original demand factor and makes this equal to 1, or no penalty.
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), the 6th heuristic removes capacity buffer consideration and depot aware connection in the demand factor calculations. Instead of rewarding or penalizing edges based on remaining capacity, it applies a harsh penalty only for exceeding capacity and a slight reward for small demand edges. The 6th heuristic also uses mean instead of quantile.
Comparing (6th) vs (7th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (7th) vs (8th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (8th) vs (9th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (9th) vs (10th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (10th) vs (11th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (11th) vs (12th), the 12th heuristic reintroduces a demand factor. It also focuses depot attraction on edges *to* the depot. It introduces node criticality with high demand nodes. and Uses an increased mean for adaptive sparsification
Comparing (12th) vs (13th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (13th) vs (14th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (14th) vs (15th), the 15th heuristic simplifies capacity handling, only penalizing edges exceeding capacity. It removes depot attraction and node criticality. The angle heuristic weight is kept. Normalization and sparsification are maintained.
Comparing (15th) vs (16th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (16th) vs (17th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (17th) vs (18th), the 18th heuristic uses a distance matrix to calculate the heuristic matrix, uses crude estimations for capacity, slight discounts for connections to the depot. The major difference is in the angle heuristics: consider node k as a potential "previous" node to node i, Calculate vectors for edges ki and ij, Calculate the angle between vectors ki and ij.
Comparing (18th) vs (19th), these heuristics are identical.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), the 20th heuristic returns a basic distance matrix, ignoring all other considerations.

Overall: The trend seems to be adding more sophisticated considerations (demand, angle, depot proximity, node criticality, adaptive sparsification) leads to better heuristics and removing them leads to worse heuristics. Adaptive sparsification using quantiles appears superior to using the mean. The best heuristic seems to balance multiple factors with carefully tuned weights and thresholds, while the worst relies solely on distance.

**Experience:**

Designing effective CVRP heuristics requires balancing multiple, potentially conflicting objectives. Start with a strong distance-based foundation, then iteratively incorporate demand considerations, spatial relationships (angles, depot proximity), and adaptive mechanisms like sparsification. Carefully tune the weights and thresholds for each component.
