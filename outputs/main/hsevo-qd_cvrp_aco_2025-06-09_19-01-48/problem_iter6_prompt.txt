Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    CVRP heuristic combining distance, demand, angle, and depot proximity, with adaptive sparsification.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # Distance heuristic (inverse square)\n    distance_heuristic = 1.0 / (distance_matrix + 1e-6)**2\n    heuristic_matrix = distance_heuristic.copy()\n\n    # Demand-based penalty/reward\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0\n                continue\n\n            combined_demand = demands[i] + demands[j]\n            if combined_demand > capacity and i != 0 and j != 0:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] *= 0.05  # Harsh penalty for exceeding capacity\n            elif combined_demand <= (capacity / 4) and i != 0 and j != 0:  # Small demand edges are slightly favored\n                heuristic_matrix[i,j] *= 1.1\n                \n            #Proximity to depot\n            if j == 0 and i != 0:\n                 heuristic_matrix[i,j] *= 0.7 # Discount connection to depot\n            if i == 0 and j != 0:\n                 heuristic_matrix[i,j] *= 0.7 # Discount connection to depot\n\n    # Angle heuristic (encourage straighter paths)\n    angle_heuristic = np.zeros((n,n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j: continue\n\n            angle_sum = 0\n            for k in range(n):\n                if k == i or k == j: continue\n\n                v1 = coordinates[i] - coordinates[k]\n                v2 = coordinates[j] - coordinates[i]\n\n                dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)\n                magnitudes = np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2)\n\n                if magnitudes > 0:\n                    cosine_angle = dot_product / magnitudes\n                    angle = np.arccos(np.clip(cosine_angle, -1.0, 1.0))\n                    angle_sum += (np.pi - angle)\n\n            if n > 2:\n                angle_heuristic[i,j] = angle_sum / (n - 2)\n            else:\n                angle_heuristic[i,j] = 0\n\n            heuristic_matrix[i, j] += 0.1 * angle_heuristic[i,j]\n\n\n    # Depot attraction (nodes closer to the depot are encouraged)\n\n    depot_attraction = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n      for j in range(n):\n        if i == j: continue\n      depot_attraction[i, j] = (1 / (distance_matrix[i, 0] + 1e-6)) + (1 / (distance_matrix[j, 0] + 1e-6))\n      heuristic_matrix[i, j] += 0.05 * depot_attraction[i, j]\n\n\n\n    # Normalize heuristics for each node\n    for i in range(n):\n        row_sum = np.sum(heuristic_matrix[i,:])\n        if row_sum > 0:\n            heuristic_matrix[i,:] /= row_sum\n\n    # Adaptive Sparsification\n    threshold = np.mean(heuristic_matrix) * 0.3 # Dynamic threshold\n    heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < threshold] = 0\n\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `heuristics_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's refine self-reflection for better heuristic design, aiming for effectiveness and actionable insights.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Factor Combination, Normalization Impact, Sparsification Rationale, Iterative Refinement Testing.\n*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each factor *before* normalization. Justify sparsification choices with problem-specific knowledge.\n*   **Avoid:** Blind simplification; always test the effect of removing or changing elements.\n*   **Explanation:** Analyze factor interactions and the impact of normalization choices on solution quality, sparsity justification, and rigorous component removal testing.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
