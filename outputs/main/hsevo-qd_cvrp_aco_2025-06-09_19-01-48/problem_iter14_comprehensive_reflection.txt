- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I understand. We need to redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective in guiding the design of better CVRP heuristics, while avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection". Here's a revised definition:

*   **Keywords:** Rigorous Evaluation, Trade-off Analysis, Component Isolation, Granularity Control
*   **Advice:** Focus on isolating and quantifying the impact of each heuristic component. Prioritize rigorous evaluation and trade-off analysis.
*   **Avoid:** Vague recommendations like "consider multiple factors" or "start with a comprehensive solution."
*   **Explanation:** Shift from general advice to concrete strategies for evaluating and refining heuristic components individually. Emphasize quantifiable improvements and trade-off understanding, not just complexity.
