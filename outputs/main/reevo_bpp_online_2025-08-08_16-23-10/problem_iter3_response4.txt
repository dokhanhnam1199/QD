[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` function calculates priority based on remaining capacity after fitting. While it favors smaller remaining capacities, it doesn't explicitly prioritize *exact* fits (zero remaining capacity) over slightly larger remaining capacities. The sigmoid function, while providing a smooth curve, might not sufficiently differentiate between a perfect fit and a very close fit.

To improve this, we can:
1.  **Introduce an explicit bonus for perfect fits:** A bin with `remaining_capacity == item` should have the highest possible priority.
2.  **Soften the penalty for slight mismatches:** Instead of a sharp drop in priority for slightly larger remaining capacities, we can use a function that emphasizes the difference between `remaining_capacity` and `item` more directly but still rewards closeness. A potential approach is to consider the ratio of the item size to the bin's original capacity, or the difference in remaining capacity scaled by the item size.
3.  **Consider the "waste" relative to the item size:** Instead of `remaining_capacity - item`, we could use `(remaining_capacity - item) / item` or similar to normalize the "badness" of a fit by the item's size. This might better capture "loose fit" relative to what the item *needs*.

Let's try a hybrid approach:
-   A perfect fit (`remaining_capacity == item`) gets a maximum priority (e.g., 1.0).
-   For other fits, we want to prioritize smaller `remaining_capacity - item`. A scaled difference or a ratio might be good.
-   We can use a softmax-like approach to generate scores that sum to 1 for all *valid* bins, ensuring a clear ranking. Or, keep the sigmoid but adjust its behavior.

Refined strategy:
We want to prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimized (and non-negative).
Let `diff = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
If `diff == 0`, highest priority.
If `diff > 0`, we want a high score for small `diff`.

A modified sigmoid or a different function could work.
Consider `score = exp(-k * diff)` for `diff >= 0`. This gives 1 for `diff=0` and decreases as `diff` increases.
To make it more distinct: `score = exp(-k * diff)`.
Maybe a step function for perfect fit, then sigmoid for others?

Let's try a function that emphasizes the *relative* slack.
`slack = (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) / item` (if item > 0, else handle appropriately)
If `slack == 0` (perfect fit), score is high.
If `slack > 0`, we want smaller `slack` to give higher scores.
Function: `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * slack))`?

Or, let's try to directly encode the "best fit" property:
Priority is high if `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small.
Let's also consider a penalty for bins that are *almost* full but can't fit the item.
The original `priority_v1` already handles non-fitting bins with 0 priority.

Let's focus on the "exact match" and "minimizing remaining capacity" aspects.
A simple way to prioritize exact fits is to add a large bonus if `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`.

Revised approach:
1.  Identify bins that can fit.
2.  For those that can fit:
    *   If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`: assign a very high score (e.g., 1.0 + epsilon or a large number).
    *   Otherwise: calculate a score based on `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`. The original sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item)))` is good for this.
3.  Combine these scores. We need a consistent scale. If using softmax later, these scores don't need to sum to 1. They just need to represent relative desirability.

Let's try to make the "best fit" property more pronounced:
Instead of `exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))`, let's use something that penalizes larger `remaining_capacity - item` more aggressively when it's small, but is still smooth.
Consider `(remaining_capacity - item) / bins_remain_cap[i]`? This ratio represents the proportion of *unused* capacity in the bin *before* packing, after accommodating the item.

Let's try a simpler modification that directly rewards smaller slack.
The current sigmoid is `1 / (1 + exp(S * (R - I)))`.
This means slack `R-I` maps to `exp(S * (R-I))`.
If `R-I = 0` (perfect fit), `exp(0) = 1`, score = `1/2`.
If `R-I = 0.1` and `S=5`, `exp(0.5) = 1.65`, score = `1/2.65 ≈ 0.37`.
If `R-I = 0.01` and `S=5`, `exp(0.05) = 1.05`, score = `1/2.05 ≈ 0.48`.

What if we want perfect fits to be *even better*?
We could use a different functional form or add a bonus.
Let's use a power function for the slack: `slack^p` where `p` is a positive exponent.
If `slack = 0`, score is 0. We want higher scores.
So, we need `1 / (1 + f(slack))` where `f(0)` is small.

Alternative: Consider the ratio of unused capacity to item size.
`ratio = (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) / item`
If `item` is very small, this ratio can become very large even for small absolute slack.
This might not be ideal.

Let's stick to the sigmoid but adjust the "steepness" logic.
What if we want tighter fits (smaller `remaining_capacity - item`) to be significantly more prioritized?
The original `steepness` already controls this. A higher `steepness` makes the transition sharper.
`steepness = 5.0` means a difference of `1/5.0 = 0.2` changes the exponent by `1`, halving the score effectively.

Let's consider the reflection's suggestion: "prioritize exact matches, then bins minimizing remaining capacity."
How to make exact matches *strictly* better?
We can define priority as:
`P = BaseScore(remaining_capacity, item) + Bonus(exact_match)`

Let's use a function that maps `remaining_capacity - item` to a priority score.
We want `f(0)` to be highest, and `f(x)` to decrease as `x` increases.

Consider: `score = 1.0 - tanh(steepness * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))` for bins that fit.
If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0`, `tanh(0) = 0`, score = `1.0`. (Perfect!)
If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0.1`, `steepness = 5`, `tanh(0.5) ≈ 0.46`, score = `1 - 0.46 = 0.54`.
If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0.2`, `steepness = 5`, `tanh(1.0) ≈ 0.76`, score = `1 - 0.76 = 0.24`.

This looks promising. The `tanh` function is good because it saturates at 1 and -1.
`tanh(x)` goes from -1 to 1.
`1 - tanh(x)` goes from 2 to 0.
We want scores between 0 and 1.

Let's rescale or use a different function.
How about `exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))`?
This gives 1 for perfect fit, and decreases.
If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0.1`, `k=10`, `exp(-1) ≈ 0.36`.
If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item = 0.01`, `k=10`, `exp(-0.1) ≈ 0.90`.

This `exp(-k * slack)` form seems to achieve the goal:
-   Perfect fit (slack=0) yields `exp(0) = 1`.
-   Small slack yields scores close to 1.
-   Larger slack yields scores that decrease exponentially.

We can control the steepness of this decrease with `k`.
Let's make `k` tunable.

What about the reflection's point about "penalizing large unused space to improve bin utilization"?
The `exp(-k * slack)` function naturally penalizes larger slack.

Let's try implementing this `exp(-k * slack)` approach.
We need to ensure we handle the `bins_remain_cap[i] < item` case correctly (priority 0).
And for `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`, calculate `slack = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
The priority score will be `exp(-k * slack)`.
We need to clip `k * slack` to avoid `exp` overflow/underflow if `slack` becomes extremely large or negative (though `slack` should always be non-negative here).
Since `slack >= 0`, `k * slack >= 0`. We only need to worry about `exp` underflow if `k * slack` is very large positive. A safe upper bound like `exp(-30)` is reasonable.

Let's choose `k` such that a "small but noticeable" slack is significantly penalized.
If slack is `0.1` and `k=5`, `exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6`.
If slack is `0.2` and `k=5`, `exp(-1.0) ≈ 0.36`.
This seems to provide a good decay.

Let's refine the tunable parameter. `steepness` is a good name.
`k = steepness`.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using an
    exponentially decaying Best Fit heuristic.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item. It assigns
    a higher priority to bins with smaller remaining capacity after packing,
    effectively implementing a "Best Fit" strategy. A perfect fit (zero remaining
    capacity after packing) receives the highest possible score (1.0). The
    priority decays exponentially as the slack (remaining capacity - item) increases.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit,
    the score is calculated as exp(-steepness * (remaining_capacity - item)).
    This function ensures that perfect fits have a score of 1, and the score
    decreases as the slack increases. The 'steepness' parameter controls how
    rapidly the priority drops with increasing slack.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect fit).
