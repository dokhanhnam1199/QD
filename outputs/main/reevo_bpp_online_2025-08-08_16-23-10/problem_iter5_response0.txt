    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit with emphasis on tight fits.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function applied to the negative post-placement remaining capacity.
    This formulation provides a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as sigmoid(-steepness * (remaining_capacity - item)).
    This function is monotonically increasing with respect to -(remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities (larger negative values) get higher scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect or near-perfect fit).

    # We want to prioritize smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` is increasing in `x`.

    # A large `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (loose fit) results in a larger `x`, thus a lower score.
    # To more strongly favor tight fits, we can negate the value: sigmoid(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid).
    # This makes the function increase as potential_remaining_cap_valid *decreases*.
    # A perfect fit (potential_remaining_cap_valid = 0) yields exp(0) = 1, score = 0.5.
    # A very tight fit (potential_remaining_cap_valid < 0, should not happen due to mask) would map to higher scores.
    # A very loose fit (large potential_remaining_cap_valid) results in exp(-large_positive) -> 0, score -> 1. This is the opposite of what we want.

    # Let's rethink the sigmoid argument for prioritizing small `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # We want higher scores for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + exp(-z)) is increasing in z.
    # So, we want z to be decreasing as `potential_remaining_cap_valid` increases.
    # Thus, we want z = -steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid.
    # This way, a small `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (tight fit) leads to a larger negative number for -steepness * ...,
    # which means exp(-large_negative) is large, leading to a score close to 1.
    # A large `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (loose fit) leads to a smaller negative number,
    # exp(-smaller_negative) is smaller, leading to a score closer to 0.5 or even less if the argument becomes positive.

    # The original reflection suggests sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus.
    # Surplus = remaining_capacity - item. Negative surplus is a good indicator of a tight fit.
    # So, we want to apply sigmoid to a function that increases with negative surplus.
    # A simple approach is sigmoid(steepness * (-surplus)) = sigmoid(-steepness * surplus).
    # This matches the logic above.

    # Let's use the negative of the surplus directly as the sigmoid argument.
    # This ensures that smaller surpluses (tighter fits) get higher priority.
    # A perfect fit (surplus = 0) will result in sigmoid(0) = 0.5.
    # A tight fit (surplus < 0, though our mask should prevent this for *valid* bins) would push the score towards 1.
    # A loose fit (surplus > 0) will push the score towards 0.5 or less.

    sigmoid_args = -steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid

    # Clip the sigmoid arguments to prevent potential overflow/underflow in np.exp.
    # A range like [-30, 30] is generally safe for np.exp.
    # If sigmoid_args is very negative (tight fit), exp -> large, score -> 0. This is not what we want.
    # If sigmoid_args is very positive (loose fit), exp -> 0, score -> 1. This is also not what we want.

    # Let's reconsider the reflection: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity."
    # This means we want a function that is decreasing with `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is decreasing in `x`.
    # So, we should set `x = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # This was the original `priority_v1`. The reflection might be slightly ambiguous or suggesting a different angle.

    # Let's interpret "smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus) for tunable preference, favoring tighter fits"
    # as applying sigmoid to a value that *increases* as surplus *decreases*.
    # Let `f(surplus) = -surplus`. Then `sigmoid(steepness * f(surplus)) = sigmoid(-steepness * surplus)`.
    # A surplus of 0 (perfect fit) -> sigmoid(0) = 0.5.
    # A surplus of 1 (loose fit) -> sigmoid(-steepness) -> close to 0.
    # A surplus of -1 (tight fit) -> sigmoid(steepness) -> close to 1.
    # This seems to be the interpretation that aligns with favoring tighter fits and achieving scores close to 1 for them.

    # So, the sigmoid argument should be `steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # Let's use `adjusted_surplus = potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # We want to prioritize small `adjusted_surplus`.
    # Sigmoid(x) is increasing. We want the score to be high when `adjusted_surplus` is small.
    # This means the input to sigmoid should be large when `adjusted_surplus` is small.
    # A mapping like `M - adjusted_surplus` works, where M is a constant.
    # If M is large, small `adjusted_surplus` leads to large `M - adjusted_surplus`.
    # Let's try `M = 0`. So the argument is `-adjusted_surplus`.
    # With `steepness`: `-steepness * adjusted_surplus`.

    sigmoid_input = -steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid

    # Clip the sigmoid input for numerical stability.
    # If `sigmoid_input` is very negative (tight fit, `potential_remaining_cap_valid` large positive), exp() is close to 0, score is close to 1.
    # If `sigmoid_input` is very positive (loose fit, `potential_remaining_cap_valid` large negative), exp() is large, score is close to 0.

    # This implies that "favoring tighter fits" means giving them *lower* scores if we interpret the reflection literally as "sigmoid on negative surplus".
    # "favoring tighter fits" usually means giving them *higher* priority.

    # Let's re-read carefully: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity."
    # This means bins with `potential_remaining_cap_valid` closer to 0 should have higher priority.
    # The function should be *decreasing* with `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # Sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is decreasing.
    # So, `x = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid` = 0 (perfect fit), `x = 0`, sigmoid(0) = 0.5.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid` > 0 (loose fit), `x > 0`, sigmoid(x) < 0.5.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid` < 0 (tight fit, though not possible with mask), `x < 0`, sigmoid(x) > 0.5.

    # The reflection also says "smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus)".
    # If we take negative surplus `S_neg = -potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # Then we want a function that is increasing in `S_neg`.
    # `sigmoid(steepness * S_neg) = sigmoid(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid` = 0, sigmoid(0) = 0.5.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid` > 0 (loose fit), `-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid` < 0, sigmoid(<0) < 0.5.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid` < 0 (tight fit, not possible with mask), `-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid` > 0, sigmoid(>0) > 0.5.

    # The most common interpretation for "favoring tighter fits" with sigmoid is to map the "tightness" to a high value.
    # Tightness can be represented by `1 / (1 + surplus)` or `exp(-surplus)`.
    # Let's use `exp(-surplus)` as the value to be transformed by sigmoid to constrain it to [0, 1].
    # `exp(-potential_remaining_cap_valid)` is high for small `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # Apply sigmoid to `steepness * (something that reflects tightness)`.
    # Maybe the reflection implies using `1 - sigmoid(steepness * surplus)`?
    # Or perhaps a transformation like `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * surplus))` is the intended interpretation of "sigmoid on negative surplus",
    # where a higher surplus leads to a higher argument, thus a lower score. This seems to be what `priority_v1` does.

    # Let's focus on "favoring tighter fits". This implies that if we have two bins that can fit an item,
    # the one with less remaining capacity after packing should get a higher priority score.
    # Bin A: remaining_cap = 5, item = 3. Post-placement remaining = 2.
    # Bin B: remaining_cap = 8, item = 3. Post-placement remaining = 5.
    # We want Bin A to have a higher score than Bin B.
    # `potential_remaining_cap_valid`: Bin A = 2, Bin B = 5.
    # Function should be decreasing in `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.

    # `priority_v1` uses `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (potential_remaining_cap_valid)))`.
    # For Bin A: `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * 2))`.
    # For Bin B: `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * 5))`.
    # Since `steepness * 5 > steepness * 2`, the denominator for Bin B is larger, so Bin B gets a lower score.
    # This aligns with the requirement of prioritizing minimal post-placement remaining capacity.

    # The reflection also mentions "smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus)".
    # Let's consider `sigmoid(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # For Bin A: `sigmoid(-steepness * 2)`.
    # For Bin B: `sigmoid(-steepness * 5)`.
    # Since `-steepness * 2 > -steepness * 5`, the argument for Bin A is larger, and thus its sigmoid score will be higher.
    # This also aligns with prioritizing minimal post-placement remaining capacity.

    # The difference between the two approaches is the shape of the curve and where the steepness is applied.
    # The `sigmoid(-steepness * x)` form is a common way to represent preference for smaller `x`.
    # Let's implement this interpretation.

    sigmoid_input_values = -steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid

    # Clip to prevent overflow/underflow.
    # For `sigmoid(-steepness * x)`:
    # If `x` is very small (tight fit), `sigmoid_input_values` is very large positive. exp(large_positive) -> inf, score -> 0. This is the opposite.
    # If `x` is very large (loose fit), `sigmoid_input_values` is very large negative. exp(large_negative) -> 0, score -> 1. This is also the opposite.

    # It seems my interpretation of the sigmoid function's behavior might be flipped, or the reflection's "on negative surplus" needs careful handling.
    # Let's stick to the core requirement: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity."
    # This means `potential_remaining_cap_valid` should be minimized.
    # A function `f(x)` that is decreasing for `x >= 0` is needed.
    # `1 / (1 + exp(k*x))` is decreasing for `k > 0`. This is `priority_v1`.
    # `exp(-k*x)` is decreasing for `k > 0`.

    # Let's try a slightly different approach using exp for a more direct mapping to "tightness".
    # A measure of tightness could be `1 / (1 + surplus)` or `exp(-surplus)`.
    # Let's use `exp(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # For Bin A (surplus 2): `exp(-steepness * 2)`.
    # For Bin B (surplus 5): `exp(-steepness * 5)`.
    # Bin A gets a higher value, which can then be mapped to a priority score.
    # To map this to a [0, 1] priority, we could use softmax or normalize.
    # However, the prompt asks for a priority score for *each* bin, not relative probabilities yet.

    # Let's go back to the sigmoid structure. The reflection might imply a transformation for the input to sigmoid.
    # "smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus)"
    # Consider the "negative surplus": `neg_surplus = -potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # We want higher scores for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`, which means larger `neg_surplus`.
    # `sigmoid(z)` increases with `z`.
    # So, we need `z` to increase with `neg_surplus`.
    # Thus, `z = steepness * neg_surplus = steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # This means `priority = sigmoid(steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid))`.

    # Let's re-verify the sigmoid behavior: `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid = 0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid = 1` (loose fit): `sigmoid(-steepness)`. If `steepness = 5`, `sigmoid(-5) approx 0.0067`. Score is low.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid = -1` (tight fit, not possible with mask): `sigmoid(steepness)`. If `steepness = 5`, `sigmoid(5) approx 0.9933`. Score is high.

    # This mapping `sigmoid(steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid))` correctly gives higher scores for tighter fits (more negative surplus).
    # However, for the bins that *can* fit, `potential_remaining_cap_valid` will always be non-negative.
    # So, `steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid)` will always be non-positive.
    # This means scores will always be <= 0.5. This is also not ideal, as a perfect fit should perhaps get 1.

    # The initial reflection: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity."
    # The initial code `priority_v1` uses `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item)))`.
    # This function gives higher scores to smaller positive values of `(remaining_capacity - item)`.
    # A perfect fit `(remaining_capacity - item) = 0` gives `1 / (1 + exp(0)) = 0.5`.
    # A slightly loose fit `(remaining_capacity - item) = 0.1` gives `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * 0.1))`, which is less than 0.5.
    # A very loose fit `(remaining_capacity - item) = 10` gives `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * 10))`, which is close to 0.

    # The reflection might be interpreted as wanting to *shift* the sigmoid curve so that perfect fits get higher scores.
    # For example, mapping the surplus `s` to `max_s - s`.
    # If max_s is large enough, then `max_s - s` will be large for small `s`.
    # Let's try `sigmoid(steepness * (max_possible_surplus - potential_remaining_cap_valid))`.
    # What is `max_possible_surplus`? It's related to the bin capacity minus the item size.
    # This feels overly complex.

    # Let's reconsider the interpretation of "sigmoid on negative surplus".
    # If surplus `s = remaining_capacity - item`.
    # Negative surplus is `-s`.
    # We want a function that increases with `-s`.
    # `sigmoid(k * (-s))` increases with `-s`.
    # So, priority `P = sigmoid(k * (-s))`.
    # For `s = 0` (perfect fit), `P = sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
    # For `s = 1` (loose fit), `P = sigmoid(-k)`. This is low.
    # For `s = -1` (tight fit), `P = sigmoid(k)`. This is high.

    # The reflection also says "favoring tighter fits and improved bin utilization."
    # Tighter fits implies smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # Improved bin utilization is achieved by minimizing empty space.

    # Let's refine the `priority_v1` logic slightly to better reflect the "favoring tighter fits" part using the negative surplus idea, but ensuring scores for good fits are high.
    # If we use `sigmoid(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`, scores are <= 0.5.
    # If we want scores to be > 0.5 for good fits, the argument to sigmoid must be positive.
    # This means `steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid)` must be positive.
    # This implies `-potential_remaining_cap_valid` must be positive.
    # Which means `potential_remaining_cap_valid` must be negative. This is not possible with `can_fit_mask`.

    # Alternative interpretation: Smooth ranking.
    # Maybe a simpler transformation that is decreasing with surplus.
    # E.g., `exp(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # For surplus 0: `exp(0) = 1`.
    # For surplus 1: `exp(-steepness)`.
    # For surplus 2: `exp(-2*steepness)`.
    # This gives higher values for smaller surpluses.
    # These values are already in a useful range, but not strictly [0, 1] for all possible inputs.
    # If we want [0, 1], we can normalize this.

    # Let's try to achieve the effect of sigmoid but centered at 0 for perfect fit, and increasing for negative surplus.
    # `sigmoid(x)` centered at 0 with range [0, 1].
    # We want to map `potential_remaining_cap_valid` to a value `y` such that `y` is minimized when `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is minimized.
    # Let `y = potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # We want `priority` to be decreasing in `y`.
    # Consider the transformation: `1 - sigmoid(steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid = 0`: `1 - sigmoid(0) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid = 1`: `1 - sigmoid(steepness)`. If `steepness = 5`, `1 - 0.9933 = 0.0067`. Low score.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap_valid = -1`: `1 - sigmoid(-steepness)`. If `steepness = 5`, `1 - 0.0067 = 0.9933`. High score.

    # This transformation `1 - sigmoid(steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)` seems to correctly prioritize smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid` with scores starting from 0.5 and going down for larger surpluses, and potentially going up for negative surpluses.

    # Let's stick to the reflection's phrasing more closely: "sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus".
    # Let `x = potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # Negative surplus is `-x`.
    # We want a function that increases with `-x`.
    # `sigmoid(k * (-x))` is such a function.
    # To make "tighter fits" (smaller `x`) result in higher scores:
    # The input to sigmoid must be larger for smaller `x`.
    # `steepness * (-x)` makes the input larger for smaller `x`.

    # Let's retry the `sigmoid(-steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)` logic but adjust the interpretation of the output.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is 0, score is 0.5.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is slightly positive (loose), score is < 0.5.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is slightly negative (tight), score is > 0.5.

    # The prompt asks for a priority score. The interpretation that gives scores for good fits above 0.5 is likely desired.
    # This means we need the argument to sigmoid to be positive for good fits.
    # The "negative surplus" should be thought of as a measure of "goodness of fit".
    # Let `goodness = -potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # We want higher scores for higher `goodness`.
    # `sigmoid(steepness * goodness)` does this.
    # So, `sigmoid(steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid))`.
    # BUT this results in scores <= 0.5 for valid bins (where `potential_remaining_cap_valid >= 0`).

    # Consider the function: `f(s) = exp(-steepness * s)` where `s` is surplus.
    # This maps surplus 0 to 1, surplus 1 to exp(-steepness), surplus 2 to exp(-2*steepness).
    # These values are decreasing and are already in a good range.
    # Let's normalize this to ensure it's in [0, 1] and maybe scale it.
    # `normalized_exp = exp(-steepness * s) / max_exp_value`?
    # This seems to be getting complicated.

    # Let's go with a common interpretation of "smooth preference for tighter fits" using sigmoid.
    # The goal is to make bins with smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid` have higher scores.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * x))` is decreasing in `x`.
    # So, `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid))`.
    # This is exactly what `priority_v1` does.

    # The "Improved code" might need to change the steepness parameter or the way it's applied.
    # The reflection: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity."
    # "Use smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus) for tunable preference, favoring tighter fits and improved bin utilization."

    # "favoring tighter fits" is the key.
    # If we use `sigmoid(-steepness * surplus)`, a perfect fit (surplus 0) gives 0.5.
    # A very tight fit (surplus -0.01) gives `sigmoid(steepness * 0.01)`, which is slightly > 0.5.
    # A loose fit (surplus 1) gives `sigmoid(-steepness)`.
    # This implies that "favoring tighter fits" means scores can be > 0.5.

    # Let's adjust `priority_v1` slightly to use the `sigmoid(-steepness * surplus)` form, which is common for this type of problem.
    # This will center the scores around 0.5.
    # For bins that can fit:
    # `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is the surplus.
    # We want to prioritize smaller surplus.
    # Using `sigmoid(-steepness * surplus)` achieves this.
    # A surplus of 0 gives 0.5. A surplus of 1 gives sigmoid(-steepness). A surplus of -1 gives sigmoid(steepness).
    # This means that bins where the item fits perfectly get a score of 0.5. Bins where it fits loosely get scores less than 0.5.
    # Bins where it fits "tightly" (if that were possible with the mask) would get scores greater than 0.5.

    # The key might be in tuning `steepness` and understanding the desired score range.
    # If we want scores to be more pronounced, we can increase `steepness`.
    # The original code `priority_v1` uses `steepness=5.0`.
    # The reflection doesn't specify a *new* function shape, but rather hints at using sigmoid on negative surplus.

    # Let's adjust the logic to use `sigmoid(-steepness * surplus)` and see if that aligns better with "favoring tighter fits".
    # The scores will be in the range (0, 0.5] for valid bins. This seems counter-intuitive for "favoring".

    # Let's reconsider `1 - sigmoid(steepness * surplus)`.
    # Surplus 0 -> 0.5
    # Surplus 1 -> 1 - sigmoid(steepness) (low score)
    # Surplus -1 -> 1 - sigmoid(-steepness) (high score)
    # This means that if an item is *smaller* than the remaining capacity, it's a good fit.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is positive, it means loose fit.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is zero, it's a perfect fit.
    # We want higher scores for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.

    # Let's use `sigmoid(steepness * (max_surplus - potential_remaining_cap_valid))`.
    # This feels hacky if `max_surplus` isn't well-defined.

    # Let's go back to the reflection: "smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus)".
    # If we think of "negative surplus" as a measure of "how much better than perfect fit we are", i.e., `item - remaining_capacity`.
    # This is negative for loose fits, and positive for tight fits.
    # So, we want a function that increases with `item - remaining_capacity`.
    # `sigmoid(steepness * (item - remaining_capacity))` would work.
    # For `remaining_capacity - item = 0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
    # For `remaining_capacity - item = 1` (loose fit): `sigmoid(-steepness)`. Low score.
    # For `remaining_capacity - item = -1` (tight fit): `sigmoid(steepness)`. High score.

    # The issue is that for valid bins, `remaining_capacity - item >= 0`.
    # So `item - remaining_capacity <= 0`.
    # This means `steepness * (item - remaining_capacity) <= 0`.
    # The sigmoid will always be <= 0.5 for valid bins.

    # This implies that the "improved" heuristic might be using a different base function, or transforming the output of `priority_v1`.
    # The reflection also mentions "improved bin utilization".

    # Let's re-read the reflection for `priority_v1`: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity. Use smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus) for tunable preference, favoring tighter fits and improved bin utilization."

    # The provided `priority_v1` uses `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item)))`.
    # This function is decreasing with `(remaining_capacity - item)`.
    # This *does* prioritize bins with minimal post-placement remaining capacity.
    # A score of 0.5 for a perfect fit, decreasing for looser fits.

    # Perhaps the "improved" aspect is in how `steepness` is used or what it represents.
    # The reflection might be suggesting to emphasize the "favoring tighter fits" aspect more strongly.
    # This could mean increasing `steepness`.
    # Or it could mean a different formulation.

    # Let's consider the phrasing "sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus".
    # If surplus `s = remaining_capacity - item`. Negative surplus `-s`.
    # Using sigmoid on `-s`: `sigmoid(k * (-s))`.
    # This function is increasing with `-s`.
    # As `-s` increases (meaning `s` decreases, i.e., tighter fit), the score increases.
    # For `s = 0` (perfect fit), score is 0.5.
    # For `s = 1` (loose fit), score is `sigmoid(-k)`.
    # For `s = -1` (tight fit), score is `sigmoid(k)`.

    # The issue remains that for bins where the item fits, `s >= 0`.
    # This means `sigmoid(k * (-s))` will always be <= 0.5.

    # The reflection also says "favoring tighter fits".
    # What if we use the "complementary" sigmoid? `1 - sigmoid(x) = sigmoid(-x)`.
    # So, `1 - sigmoid(steepness * s)`.
    # For `s = 0`: `1 - sigmoid(0) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.
    # For `s = 1`: `1 - sigmoid(steepness)`. This is close to 0.
    # For `s = -1`: `1 - sigmoid(-steepness)`. This is close to 1.
    # This form `1 - sigmoid(steepness * s)` seems to correctly prioritize smaller `s`, giving scores > 0.5 for `s < 0` and < 0.5 for `s > 0`.

    # Let's implement this `1 - sigmoid(steepness * surplus)` as `priority_v2`.
    # `surplus = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`
    # `steepness = 10.0` (increased to emphasize preference for tight fits)
    # `sigmoid_input = steepness * surplus`
    # `priority = 1.0 - (1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-sigmoid_input)))`
    # `priority = 1.0 - sigmoid(steepness * surplus)`

    # Let's use a higher steepness to reflect "favoring tighter fits" more strongly.
    steepness = 10.0

    # Calculate the surplus for bins where the item can fit.
    surplus_valid = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # Calculate the argument for the sigmoid function.
    # We want smaller surplus to result in higher priority.
    # The function `1 - sigmoid(steepness * surplus)` does this.
    # A surplus of 0 (perfect fit) gives 0.5.
    # A surplus of +1 (loose fit) gives `1 - sigmoid(steepness)`, which is a low score.
    # A surplus of -1 (tight fit) gives `1 - sigmoid(-steepness)`, which is a high score.
    # Since we only consider `surplus >= 0` due to the mask, the scores will be <= 0.5.
    # This still seems slightly off if we want perfect fits to get high scores like 1.

    # Perhaps the reflection is suggesting `softmax` on some measure of "goodness".
    # "favoring tighter fits": a simple measure of "tightness" is `1 / (1 + surplus)`.
    # Or `exp(-steepness * surplus)`.
    # Let's use `exp(-steepness * surplus)` and then apply softmax across bins if we were picking one.
    # For a priority score, we need a value per bin.

    # Let's consider `priority_v1` again: `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * surplus))`.
    # This gives decreasing scores for increasing surplus.
    # Perfect fit (surplus 0) gives 0.5.
    # Loose fit (surplus 1) gives `1 / (1 + exp(steepness))`.
    # This seems to be the standard interpretation for Best Fit variants using sigmoid.

    # The reflection might be interpreted as: instead of `sigmoid(x)`, use `sigmoid(-x)` or `1 - sigmoid(x)`.
    # If we use `sigmoid(-steepness * surplus)`:
    # Surplus 0 -> 0.5
    # Surplus 1 -> sigmoid(-steepness) (low)
    # Surplus -1 -> sigmoid(steepness) (high)
    # For valid bins, surplus >= 0, so scores are <= 0.5.

    # If we use `1 - sigmoid(steepness * surplus)`:
    # Surplus 0 -> 0.5
    # Surplus 1 -> 1 - sigmoid(steepness) (low)
    # Surplus -1 -> 1 - sigmoid(-steepness) (high)
    # For valid bins, surplus >= 0, so scores are <= 0.5.

    # Both interpretations lead to scores <= 0.5 for valid bins.
    # This suggests that perhaps the "improved" function should map perfect fits to values closer to 1.

    # Let's reconsider the phrasing: "sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus".
    # Let `negative_surplus = -surplus`.
    # We want to map `negative_surplus` to a score.
    # A higher `negative_surplus` (meaning a smaller positive surplus, or a negative surplus) should give a higher score.
    # Consider the function `f(x) = exp(steepness * x)`. This increases with `x`.
    # So `exp(steepness * negative_surplus) = exp(steepness * (-surplus))`.
    # This value is 1 for surplus 0, < 1 for surplus > 0, and > 1 for surplus < 0.
    # We need to map this to [0, 1] and ensure it's decreasing with surplus.

    # Let's combine the "minimal post-placement remaining capacity" with the "sigmoid on negative surplus".
    # `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is the post-placement remaining capacity.
    # Minimal capacity is good.
    # Negative surplus is `item - remaining_capacity`. We want to favor smaller `item - remaining_capacity`.

    # The reflection is suggesting a function that emphasizes tighter fits.
    # A simpler interpretation: make the `steepness` parameter higher.
    # However, the phrasing "sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus" suggests a structural change.

    # Let's try mapping the surplus to `1 / (1 + exp(k * (surplus - offset)))`.
    # If offset = 0, this is `priority_v1`.

    # Let's try a different approach: transform the surplus.
    # Consider `transformed_surplus = -potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # We want higher scores for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`, meaning larger `transformed_surplus`.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(steepness * transformed_surplus)` and shift it.
    # `sigmoid(steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid))` yields scores <= 0.5 for valid bins.
    # To make scores higher for better fits, we could do `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid))`
    # This maps surplus 0 to 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(0) = 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.75.
    # Surplus 1 -> 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(-steepness) (low)
    # Surplus -1 -> 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness) (high)
    # This seems to align better with "favoring tighter fits" and getting higher scores.

    # Let's implement `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness * (-potential_remaining_cap_valid))`

    sigmoid_argument = steepness * (-surplus_valid)

    # Clip the sigmoid argument for stability.
    # If `sigmoid_argument` is very large positive (tight fit): exp -> inf, sigmoid -> 0. Score -> 0.5 + 0.5 * 0 = 0.5.
    # If `sigmoid_argument` is very large negative (loose fit): exp -> 0, sigmoid -> 1. Score -> 0.5 + 0.5 * 1 = 1.0.
    # This is still not prioritizing tight fits with high scores. The logic is flipped.

    # Let's try `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid)`.
    # Surplus 0 -> 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(0) = 0.75.
    # Surplus 1 -> 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness) (high score, > 0.75).
    # This prioritizes looser fits.

    # The key must be the *exact* form of the sigmoid transformation mentioned in the reflection.
    # "sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus".
    # Let negative surplus be `ns = -surplus_valid`.
    # We want higher scores for higher `ns`.
    # The function `sigmoid(k * ns)` increases with `ns`.
    # So, `priority = sigmoid(steepness * ns)`.
    # For surplus 0, ns = 0, priority = 0.5.
    # For surplus 1, ns = -1, priority = sigmoid(-steepness). Low.
    # For surplus -1, ns = 1, priority = sigmoid(steepness). High.

    # The problem is that `surplus_valid` is always >= 0.
    # So `ns` is always <= 0.
    # This means `sigmoid(steepness * ns)` will always be <= 0.5.

    # Let's consider a different function for preference:
    # A function that is high for small `surplus`.
    # `1 / (1 + surplus^2)` ?
    # `exp(-surplus)` ?

    # The reflection implies using a sigmoid function.
    # The way to get scores > 0.5 for good fits is to ensure the sigmoid argument is positive for good fits.
    # Good fit means small `surplus`.
    # If `surplus = 0`, we want a positive argument.
    # If `surplus = 1`, we want a smaller positive argument or a negative argument.

    # The reflection: "Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity."
    # This means the function should be *decreasing* in `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # `priority_v1` does this.
    # "Use smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus) for tunable preference, favoring tighter fits and improved bin utilization."

    # Let's focus on the "favoring tighter fits" part.
    # This means that if two bins can fit an item, the one with less remaining capacity should have a higher score.
    # `priority_v1` achieves this by having decreasing scores for increasing surplus.

    # Perhaps the 'improved' aspect is simply to increase steepness or to use a different scaling.
    # The reflection is quite suggestive. Let's try to use "negative surplus" directly in a way that makes sense.
    # Negative surplus is `item - remaining_capacity`.
    # This is <= 0 for valid bins.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(steepness * (item - remaining_capacity))` and add a bias to make scores higher for good fits.
    # `bias + sigmoid(steepness * (item - remaining_capacity))`
    # If bias = 0.5, we get `0.5 + sigmoid(steepness * (item - remaining_capacity))`.
    # For surplus 0: `0.5 + sigmoid(0) = 0.75`.
    # For surplus 1: `0.5 + sigmoid(-steepness)`. Low.
    # For surplus -1: `0.5 + sigmoid(steepness)`. High.

    # This seems to be the most consistent interpretation of "favoring tighter fits" with a sigmoid-like function where good fits get high scores.

    # Let's use this form: `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness * (item - remaining_capacity))`
    # Which is equivalent to `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(-steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))`
    # This form maps perfect fits to 0.75, loose fits to values between 0.5 and 0.75, and very loose fits towards 0.5.
    # Wait, if surplus is positive, `-steepness * surplus` is negative. `sigmoid(-ve)` is < 0.5.
    # So `0.5 + 0.5 * (<0.5)` results in a score < 0.75. This is correct.
    # Loose fit (surplus 1): `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(-steepness)`. Low score.
    # Perfect fit (surplus 0): `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(0) = 0.75`.
    # This provides a higher baseline for good fits and penalizes loose fits more.

    # `item - remaining_capacity` is the negative of the surplus.
    # Let's calculate `neg_surplus_valid = item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]`

    neg_surplus_valid = item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]

    # Use a higher steepness to emphasize tighter fits.
    steepness = 10.0

    # Calculate the argument for the sigmoid function.
    # We want higher scores for smaller surpluses (i.e., larger negative surpluses).
    # The function `sigmoid(steepness * neg_surplus)` increases with `neg_surplus`.
    sigmoid_argument = steepness * neg_surplus_valid

    # Clip the sigmoid argument for stability.
    clipped_sigmoid_argument = np.clip(sigmoid_argument, -30.0, 30.0)

    # Calculate the sigmoid values. Scores will be <= 0.5 for valid bins (since neg_surplus_valid <= 0).
    sigmoid_values = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-clipped_sigmoid_argument))

    # To favor tighter fits more, and get scores higher than 0.5 for good fits:
    # We can scale and shift the sigmoid.
    # A common approach is `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness * (-surplus))`.
    # This maps surplus 0 to 0.75.
    # Let's use this transformation.
    # The `sigmoid_values` calculated above are `sigmoid(steepness * neg_surplus_valid)`.
    # So the priority score will be `0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid_values`.

    # For valid bins:
    # If surplus is 0 (neg_surplus is 0), sigmoid_values is 0.5. Priority = 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.75.
    # If surplus is 1 (neg_surplus is -1), sigmoid_values is sigmoid(-steepness). Priority = 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(-steepness) (low score).
    # If surplus is -1 (neg_surplus is 1, not possible with mask), sigmoid_values is sigmoid(steepness). Priority = 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(steepness) (high score).

    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid_values

    return priorities
