Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing for better fit.
Use exponential functions for smoother, differentiable priority mapping, favoring less surplus.
Prioritize tighter fits by directly minimizing remaining capacity, avoiding complex functions.
Prioritize bins with minimal *resulting* remaining capacity. Use sigmoids for normalized, tunable sensitivity.
Smoothness, non-linearity, and strategic parameter tuning improve heuristic performance.
Softmax-like transformations can create more nuanced priorities than simple inverses.
Prioritize tighter fits with a decreasing sigmoid of remaining capacity.
Prioritize minimal surplus. Use negative surplus for softmax.
Prioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity for better fit.
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity, then consider item size and bin capacity dynamics.
