BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

This\n    strategy is \"greedy\" in the sense that it tries to leave as much space as\n    possible in the bins, hoping to accommodate larger items later. For an online\n    problem, the priority is assigned based on how \"bad\" a fit would be in terms\n    of minimizing the remaining capacity after the item is placed. Thus, bins\n    with more remaining capacity are considered \"better\" candidates (higher priority)\n    for an item in a Worst Fit approach because they represent the worst possible\n    fit at that moment.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n        A higher score indicates a higher priority (i.e., a bin with more remaining\n        capacity).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize priorities to a very small negative number to handle cases\n    # where an item cannot fit into any bin.\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity if the item were placed in each bin.\n    # This is only possible if the bin has enough capacity for the item.\n    possible_fits = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    # For bins where the item fits, the priority is simply the remaining capacity\n    # of that bin.
