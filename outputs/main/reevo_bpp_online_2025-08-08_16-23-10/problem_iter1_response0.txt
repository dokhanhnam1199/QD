    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using First Fit strategy.

    This priority function implements the First Fit strategy for the online Bin Packing Problem.
    It assigns a high priority (1) to bins that have enough remaining capacity to fit the item,
    and a low priority (0) to bins that do not. This ensures that the first available bin
    with sufficient capacity is chosen.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
