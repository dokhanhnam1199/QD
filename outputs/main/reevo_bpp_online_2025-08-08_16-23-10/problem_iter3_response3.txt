[Prior reflection]
Focus on "best fit" strategies: prioritize exact matches, then bins minimizing remaining capacity. Employ sigmoid or softmax for smooth preference curves, penalizing large unused space to improve bin utilization.

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a
    multi-objective priority function that favors tight fits and exact matches.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item.
    It assigns a higher priority to bins that offer an exact fit (remaining capacity == item).
    For bins that don't offer an exact fit but can accommodate the item, it uses a
    sigmoid function to rank them based on how tightly they fit, penalizing larger
    unused space.

    The score for a bin is calculated as follows:
    - If the item cannot fit: 0.0
    - If the item fits exactly (remaining_capacity == item): A high fixed value (e.g., 1.0 + epsilon).
    - If the item fits but not exactly: Sigmoid of the negative remaining capacity after packing,
      scaled by a steepness factor. The formula is 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
      This results in scores closer to 1 for tighter fits and closer to 0 for looser fits.
      To ensure exact matches have higher priority than even perfect fits (where remaining_capacity - item is 0),
      we can adjust the sigmoid output slightly or add a bonus. A simpler approach is to ensure the exact
      match score is strictly greater than the max sigmoid score.
