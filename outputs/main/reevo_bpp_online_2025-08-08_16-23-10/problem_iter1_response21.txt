    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Best Fit.

    The Best Fit strategy prioritizes bins that have the smallest remaining capacity
    after placing the item, as long as the item fits. A larger priority score indicates
    a more preferred bin. If an item does not fit in a bin, its priority is set to 0.
    The priority is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity after placement,
    with an adjustment to favor bins that leave minimal waste.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # The priority is higher for bins that have less remaining capacity after fitting
    # We can use the inverse of remaining capacity or a similar measure.
    # To avoid division by zero and to ensure higher values are better,
    # we can use a term like 1 / (1 + remaining_capacity) or a large constant minus remaining_capacity.
    # Let's use a formulation that rewards smaller remaining capacities more strongly,
    # but also ensures a baseline preference for bins that are nearly full.
    
    # A common approach for "best fit" is to prioritize bins that have the smallest
    # capacity that is still greater than or equal to the item.
    # This means we want to find bins with `bins_remain_cap[i]` that are closest to `item`.
    
    # Let's calculate a priority score that is high when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small.
    # A simple way is `1 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))` for fitting bins.
    # However, for best fit, we want the smallest leftover space.
    # So, the "best" bin will have the smallest positive `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    
    # We can assign a high priority to bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimized.
    # Let's try to make the priority a measure of how "tight" the fit is.
    # A small positive value for `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` indicates a good fit.
    
    # We want to maximize the priority. The best fit leaves the minimum positive `remaining_capacity`.
    # So, a larger priority should be given to bins with smaller positive `remaining_capacity`.
    # We can invert this. Let's use `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` for fitting bins.
    # The smallest `bins_remain_cap - item` will result in the largest negative number,
    # which is not what we want if higher means better.
    
    # Let's refine: Higher priority means "more likely to be chosen".
    # For Best Fit, the bin with the smallest *positive* difference
    # (`bins_remain_cap - item`) is the best.
    # We can achieve this by setting priority proportional to `1 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap - item))`.
    # However, this might give very high priority to bins that have a lot of remaining capacity
    # if the `item` is very small.
    
    # A common way to implement "best fit" priority:
    # For each bin `j` where `bins_remain_cap[j] >= item`, calculate a "fit score".
    # The best fit is the one with the minimum `bins_remain_cap[j] - item`.
    # We want to map this to a priority where higher is better.
    # We can set the priority to be `(max_possible_capacity + 1) - (bins_remain_cap[j] - item)`.
    # Or, simply use the negative difference, and then take the maximum among fitting bins.
    
    # Let's try a priority that is proportional to `1 / (1 + (remaining_capacity - item))` for bins that fit.
    # To ensure "best fit" (smallest `remaining_capacity - item`), we can
    # assign higher priorities to smaller positive differences.
    
    # Option 1: Direct inverse of remaining space (higher priority for smaller leftover)
    # This can be sensitive to the scale of capacities.
    # priorities[possible_bins_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + remaining_capacities_after_fit)

    # Option 2: A large value minus the leftover space. This rewards tighter fits.
    # We need a reference for "large value". The maximum possible remaining capacity
    # of a bin before adding an item could be a baseline, but bins vary.
    # Let's consider the maximum *initial* capacity of any bin (though not explicitly given,
    # we can assume a hypothetical maximum or a large constant).
    # For simplicity, let's assign a higher priority to bins with smaller `remaining_capacities_after_fit`.
    
    # To make "best fit" mean highest priority, we want the smallest `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # So, if `bins_remain_cap[j] - item = d`, we want a priority `P(d)` that is increasing with `d`.
    # Wait, no, we want highest priority for the *smallest positive d*.
    # So, `P(d)` should be *decreasing* as `d` increases for `d >= 0`.
    # However, we also want to ensure that bins that *can* fit are prioritized over those that *cannot*.
    
    # Let's use a scoring system where:
    # - Bins that don't fit get a score of 0.
    # - Bins that fit get a score related to how little space is left.
    #   The smaller the `remaining_capacity - item`, the higher the score.
    #   This implies an inverse relationship with `remaining_capacity - item`.
    
    # To make the highest priority correspond to the "best fit" (smallest positive residual),
    # we can assign a score that is large when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and positive.
    # A score of `1 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))` for fitting bins would give higher scores to smaller residuals.
    # However, `np.argmax` on `1 / (1 + residuals)` would pick the smallest residual.
    
    # Consider the values of `bins_remain_cap - item` for fitting bins. We want the minimum of these.
    # If we set `priorities[possible_bins_mask] = -(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins_mask] - item)`,
    # then `np.argmax` will select the bin with the smallest residual (most negative number).
    # This is effectively Best Fit.
