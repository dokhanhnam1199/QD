Prioritize by decreasing post-placement capacity. Tune steepness for preference.
Prioritize tight fits by minimizing remaining capacity *after* packing.
Prioritize tight fits: use functions that increase with decreasing surplus.
Tune parameters, adjust steepness, consider decay rates for balanced priority.
Tune sigmoid parameters for gap preference, or combine fit strategies.
Smooth, non-linear functions with tunable parameters for balanced packing.
Smooth non-linear functions, like sigmoid, can yield better results than linear ones.
Prioritize tightest fits. Experiment with normalization and sensitivity parameters.
Prioritize minimizing slack. Simpler, direct metrics often outperform complex, non-linear ones.
Prioritize tight fits, balance with item/bin proportion for better packing.
