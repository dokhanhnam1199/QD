[Prior reflection]
Prioritize tight fits using non-linear functions on surplus. Tune steepness/parameters for balanced preference. Consider decay rates. Experiment with simpler metrics too; directness can outperform complexity. Balance item/bin proportions.

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect or near-perfect fit).

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a tuned Sigmoid Best Fit,
    incorporating a decay factor for older bins and prioritizing tighter fits more aggressively.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function, modified to favor tighter fits more strongly via a tunable
    'steepness' parameter. Additionally, a 'decay_rate' is applied to the priority based on
    the bin's "age" (implied by its position in the array, assuming bins are created sequentially).
    Older bins (earlier in the array) receive a slightly reduced priority to favor newer,
    potentially better-fitting configurations.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as:
    (1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item)))) * (decay_rate ** bin_index)

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to ~decay_rate^N for
        perfect or near-perfect fits in the last bin, where N is the number of bins.
