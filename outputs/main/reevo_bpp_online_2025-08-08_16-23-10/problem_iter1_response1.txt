    # Find bins that can accommodate the item
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # Calculate the remaining capacity *after* placing the item
    # We want to prioritize bins where this value is minimized (i.e., the "best fit")
    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # The priority score is inversely related to the remaining capacity after fitting.
    # A smaller remaining capacity (closer to 0) means a higher priority.
    # To avoid division by zero and to give higher scores to bins that fit snugly,
    # we can use a large number minus the remaining capacity.
    # Add a small epsilon to the remaining capacity to avoid division by zero if an item
    # perfectly fills a bin and to ensure that bins with less remaining space get higher scores.
    # A common approach is to use 1 / (remaining_capacity + epsilon).
    # However, for best fit, we want to MINIMIZE remaining_capacity.
    # So, a good strategy is to assign a high priority to the bin with the smallest
    # `remaining_after_fit`.
    # We can transform the `remaining_after_fit` values such that smaller values
    # result in larger priorities. A simple way is to invert them or use their negative.
    # Let's use 1 / (remaining_after_fit + a_small_constant) where the small constant
    # helps in cases where remaining_after_fit is 0.
    # A more direct way for "best fit" is to simply rank them: the best fit has the minimum
    # remaining space. So, we can assign a score based on the rank or a transformed value.

    # For best fit, the goal is to find the bin that has the smallest remaining capacity
    # *after* the item is placed in it, provided it fits.
    # So, we want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` among valid bins.
    # Or equivalently, minimize `bins_remain_cap - item`.

    # Let's assign priority based on how "tightly" the item fits.
    # The difference `bins_remain_cap - item` represents the slack.
    # We want to minimize this slack.
    # A higher priority score should be given to a smaller slack.
    # So, we can use something like `1 / (slack + epsilon)` or `max_slack - slack`.
    # Using `max_slack - slack` makes larger values of slack have lower priority.
    # Let's calculate the slack for bins that can fit the item.

    slacks = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # If there are no bins that can fit the item, return all zeros.
    if not slacks.size:
        return priorities

    # We want to assign higher priority to smaller slacks.
    # We can achieve this by taking the inverse of (slack + a small number)
    # to avoid division by zero, or by taking the negative of slack.
    # Let's use `1 / (slack + 1e-6)` which means smaller slacks get larger values.
    # Alternatively, we can directly use the negative slack as priority if we
    # are going to select the maximum, or if we are going to select the minimum of `-priority`.

    # Let's use a scoring system where a perfect fit (slack = 0) gets the highest priority.
    # A slightly larger slack gets a slightly lower priority.
    # `1.0 / (slack + 1e-9)` works well.
    # Or, `(max_slack_possible - slack)` where `max_slack_possible` is greater than any slack.
    # For simplicity and to directly implement "smallest remaining capacity",
    # we can assign priority as `-slack`. Then the bin with the highest priority
    # will be the one with the smallest slack.
