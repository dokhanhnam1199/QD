    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit
    with an emphasis on tighter fits.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function where higher priority is given to bins that result in a
    smaller remaining capacity after the item is placed.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function ensures that smaller non-negative `remaining_capacity - item` values
    (tighter fits) result in higher priority scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect or near-perfect fit).

    # The sigmoid function is `1 / (1 + exp(x))`.
    # To prioritize smaller `fit_gaps`, we want the score to be higher when `fit_gaps` is smaller.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is a decreasing function of `x`.
    # Therefore, we set `x = steepness * fit_gaps`.

    # A larger `fit_gap` leads to a larger `x`, thus a smaller score.

    # Clip the exponent arguments to prevent potential overflow/underflow in np.exp.
    # Values around +/- 700 can cause issues. A range like [-30, 30] is generally safe.
    # For very negative args, exp -> 0, score -> 1. For very positive args, exp -> inf, score -> 0.
    # This ensures that perfect fits (gap=0) get a score close to 0.5, and tighter fits (negative gap, which shouldn't happen here ideally, but for robustness) get scores closer to 1.
    # However, the intention is to penalize larger positive gaps.
    # Let's adjust the formula to directly penalize the gap.
    # We want a decreasing function of `fit_gaps`.
    # The current form `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * fit_gaps))` works.
    # For a perfect fit (fit_gaps = 0), score is 0.5.
    # For a tight fit (fit_gaps slightly > 0), score is < 0.5.
    # For a loose fit (fit_gaps much > 0), score is close to 0.
    # The reflection wants to prioritize tighter fits. The current implementation does this.

    # Let's reconsider the reflection: "Prioritize tighter fits with a decreasing sigmoid of remaining capacity."
    # The current code uses `remaining_capacity - item` (the gap) as the argument.
    # A smaller gap is a tighter fit.
    # `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * gap))` decreases as `gap` increases.
    # So, smaller `gap` -> higher score. This matches the reflection.

    # Example:
    # Bin A: remaining=5, item=3 -> gap=2. Score = 1/(1+exp(10*2)) = 1/(1+e^20) ~ 0
    # Bin B: remaining=4, item=3 -> gap=1. Score = 1/(1+exp(10*1)) = 1/(1+e^10) ~ 0
    # Bin C: remaining=3.1, item=3 -> gap=0.1. Score = 1/(1+exp(10*0.1)) = 1/(1+e^1) ~ 0.27
    # Bin D: remaining=3, item=3 -> gap=0. Score = 1/(1+exp(10*0)) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5

    # If we want to prioritize tighter fits *more* aggressively, perhaps a different mapping or scaling of the gap is needed.
    # The original v0 used `1.0 / (resulting_remaining_cap + epsilon)`. This is monotonically increasing with tightness.
    # And then `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (1.0 / (resulting_remaining_cap + epsilon))))`.
    # This is `1 / (1 + exp(-k / gap))`. This function increases as `gap` decreases.
    # So v0 prioritized smaller gaps more directly.

    # Let's try a modification based on v0's idea of inverse gap, but mapped to a decreasing sigmoid.
    # We want higher score for smaller gaps.
    # Let's use `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * gap))` as in v1, but adjust `steepness` or the `gap` calculation slightly if needed.
    # The current v1 implementation already prioritizes tighter fits. The `steepness` parameter controls how *strongly* this preference is applied.
    # A higher `steepness` means that even small differences in the gap will result in significant differences in priority.

    # The reflection is essentially what v1 is doing. The code seems aligned with the reflection.
    # The key is that `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * x))` is a decreasing function.
    # So, if `x` is `fit_gaps`, then as `fit_gaps` (remaining capacity after packing) decreases (tighter fit), the score increases.

    # Let's ensure the mapping is robust and clear.
    # A "perfect fit" (remaining_capacity == item) should have a high score. `fit_gap = 0`. Score = 0.5.
    # A "very tight fit" (remaining_capacity slightly less than item, which is not allowed by `can_fit_mask`, or just slightly more than item) should have an even higher score.
    # If `bins_remain_cap` could be exactly `item`, `fit_gaps` is 0, score is 0.5.
    # If we want a score approaching 1 for a perfect fit, we need to shift the sigmoid or invert the argument.

    # Let's try to map `fit_gaps` to a scale where 0 is perfect, and positive values are deviations.
    # Consider `exp(-steepness * fit_gaps)`.
    # For `fit_gaps = 0` (perfect), this is `exp(0) = 1`.
    # For `fit_gaps > 0` (loose), this decreases.
    # We can use this as part of a score.
    # Maybe normalize `fit_gaps`? `fit_gaps / bin_capacity`.

    # The prompt asks for prioritization of *tighter* fits. This means smaller `fit_gaps`.
    # The v1 sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * fit_gaps))` gives higher scores for smaller `fit_gaps`.
    # This *is* prioritizing tighter fits.
    # The parameter `steepness` directly controls how strongly this prioritization happens.
    # A `steepness` of 10.0 means that a difference of 0.1 in `fit_gaps` leads to a significant change in score.
    # For `steepness=10`:
    # gap = 0.0 -> exp(0) = 1 -> score = 0.5
    # gap = 0.1 -> exp(1) = 2.718 -> score = 1/(1+2.718) ~ 0.27
    # gap = 0.2 -> exp(2) = 7.389 -> score = 1/(1+7.389) ~ 0.11
    # gap = 0.3 -> exp(3) = 20.08 -> score = 1/(1+20.08) ~ 0.047

    # This seems to be working as intended by the reflection. The v1 implementation is already quite good for this.
    # The only potential improvement could be the *range* of scores or the *shape* of the preference.
    # If we want scores to be closer to 1 for tighter fits, we could modify the sigmoid.
    # For example, map `fit_gaps` to `y` such that `y=0` is perfect fit, and then use `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * y))`.
    # Or map `fit_gaps` to `-fit_gaps` and use `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (-fit_gaps))) = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * fit_gaps))`.
    # Let's test this alternative: `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * fit_gaps))`
    # For `steepness=10`:
    # gap = 0.0 -> exp(0) = 1 -> score = 0.5
    # gap = 0.1 -> exp(-1) = 0.367 -> score = 1/(1+0.367) ~ 0.73
    # gap = 0.2 -> exp(-2) = 0.135 -> score = 1/(1+0.135) ~ 0.88
    # gap = 0.3 -> exp(-3) = 0.049 -> score = 1/(1+0.049) ~ 0.95

    # This alternative mapping `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * fit_gaps))` gives higher scores for tighter fits,
    # approaching 1, while the original v1 `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * fit_gaps))` approaches 0.5 for perfect fits.
    # The reflection "Prioritize tighter fits with a decreasing sigmoid of remaining capacity" is a bit ambiguous.
    # Does it mean the *score* is decreasing with remaining capacity? If so, v1 is correct.
    # Or does it mean the *function itself* is a decreasing sigmoid applied to something related to capacity?

    # Given the common usage of sigmoid in heuristics, mapping a preference (tighter fit) to a higher score is typical.
    # The alternative `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * fit_gaps))` achieves this more directly, assigning scores closer to 1 for better fits.
    # Let's adopt this for `priority_v2` as it feels like a more direct implementation of "higher priority for tighter fits".

    # Recalculate `exponent_args` for the new formula:
    # We want higher scores for smaller `fit_gaps`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is decreasing in `x`.
    # To make it increasing in `fit_gaps`, we need `x` to be decreasing in `fit_gaps`.
    # So, `x = -steepness * fit_gaps`.

    exponent_args = -steepness * fit_gaps

    # Clipping is still important.
    # For very small `fit_gaps` (e.g., item size very close to bin capacity), `exponent_args` can become very negative.
    # e.g., `fit_gap = 0.001`, `steepness = 10` -> `exp(-0.01)` -> score close to 0.5.
    # If `fit_gap = 0` -> `exp(0)` -> score = 0.5.
    # If `fit_gap = -0.001` (hypothetical, if item > capacity but `can_fit_mask` allowed), `exp(0.01)` -> score slightly < 0.5.
    # The critical part is preventing `exp` from going to infinity or zero.
    # `exponent_args` range from `-steepness * max_fit_gap` to `-steepness * min_fit_gap`.
    # If `fit_gaps` are always non-negative, the minimum is 0.
    # The maximum `fit_gap` can be `bin_capacity - min_item_size`.
    # Let's clip `exponent_args` to avoid extreme values.
    # If `exponent_args` is very positive (large `fit_gap`), `exp` is large, score is near 0.
    # If `exponent_args` is very negative (small `fit_gap`), `exp` is near 0, score is near 1.
    # Clipping range needs to consider these effects.
    # A safe range for `exp` is typically where `x` is between -20 and 20.
    # If `steepness * fit_gaps` is between -20 and 20, then `exponent_args` should be between -20 and 20.
    # So `x = -steepness * fit_gaps` should be between -20 and 20.
    # This means `steepness * fit_gaps` should be between -20 and 20.
    # Since `fit_gaps >= 0` and `steepness > 0`, `steepness * fit_gaps` is always >= 0.
    # So the constraint is `steepness * fit_gaps <= 20`.
    # `fit_gaps <= 20 / steepness`.
    # This implies that `fit_gaps` larger than `20/steepness` will result in `exponent_args` being <= -20, and scores close to 1. This is not what we want.

    # Let's go back to the original v1 formula's logic: `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * fit_gaps))`.
    # This formula yields scores that *decrease* as `fit_gaps` increases.
    # A smaller `fit_gap` (tighter fit) leads to a higher score.
    # This aligns with prioritizing tighter fits. The scores naturally range from near 0 (very loose fits) up to 0.5 (perfect fits).
    # If the goal is simply to *rank* bins by tightness, this is sufficient.
    # If the goal is to have scores that *approach 1* for the best fits, the alternative formula is needed.

    # Let's re-read reflection: "Prioritize tighter fits with a decreasing sigmoid of remaining capacity."
    # This phrasing is tricky.
    # Option A: Prioritize bins where `remaining_capacity` is small. The score should be high for small `remaining_capacity`.
    # Option B: The function *used* to calculate priority is a decreasing sigmoid, applied to `remaining_capacity`.

    # If Option A is the intent:
    # `fit_gaps = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`
    # We want `score(bin)` to be high when `fit_gaps` is low.
    # The function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * x))` is decreasing in `x`.
    # So, setting `x = fit_gaps` means score is high when `fit_gaps` is low. This matches Option A.

    # If Option B is the intent:
    # "decreasing sigmoid of remaining capacity": this could mean `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * bins_remain_cap[i]))`
    # But we also need to consider the `item`. The priority should depend on *both* `item` and `bins_remain_cap`.
    # This interpretation seems less likely as it doesn't directly use the `item` size in the sigmoid argument itself.

    # Let's stick with the interpretation that we want a high score for small `fit_gaps`.
    # The v1 code `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * fit_gaps))` already does this, giving scores up to 0.5.
    # If we want scores up to 1, the `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * fit_gaps))` formulation is better.
    # Let's ensure the `steepness` and clipping are suitable for this version.

    # New `exponent_args` = `-steepness * fit_gaps`.
    # `steepness` = 10.0.
    # If `fit_gaps` = 0 (perfect fit), `exponent_args` = 0. `exp(0)` = 1. Score = 0.5.
    # If `fit_gaps` = 0.1, `exponent_args` = -1. `exp(-1)` = 0.367. Score = 0.73.
    # If `fit_gaps` = 0.2, `exponent_args` = -2. `exp(-2)` = 0.135. Score = 0.88.
    # If `fit_gaps` = 0.3, `exponent_args` = -3. `exp(-3)` = 0.049. Score = 0.95.
    # If `fit_gaps` = 0.5, `exponent_args` = -5. `exp(-5)` = 0.0067. Score = 0.993.
    # If `fit_gaps` = 1.0, `exponent_args` = -10. `exp(-10)` = 0.000045. Score = 0.99995.

    # This mapping appears to strongly prioritize smaller gaps and assign scores approaching 1.
    # The clipping needs to prevent `exp(-steepness * fit_gaps)` from becoming 0 or causing issues.
    # If `exponent_args` becomes very small (e.g., -30), `exp` is near zero, score is near 1.
    # If `exponent_args` becomes very large (e.g., +30), `exp` is very large, score is near 0.
    # The `clipped_exponent_args` should be in a range that makes `exp` well-behaved.
    # If `exponent_args = -steepness * fit_gaps`, and we want to prevent `exp` from being too small or too large:
    # Let's clip `exponent_args` to [-30, 30].
    # If `-steepness * fit_gaps` is less than -30 (i.e., `steepness * fit_gaps > 30`), then `exp` is very small, score is near 1.
    # If `-steepness * fit_gaps` is greater than 30 (i.e., `steepness * fit_gaps < -30`), this won't happen as `fit_gaps >= 0`.
    # So clipping `exponent_args` to [-30, 30] seems reasonable. `np.clip(-steepness * fit_gaps, -30.0, 30.0)`
    # This ensures `exp` is between `exp(-30)` and `exp(30)`.

    clipped_exponent_args = np.clip(exponent_args, -30.0, 30.0)
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(clipped_exponent_args))
