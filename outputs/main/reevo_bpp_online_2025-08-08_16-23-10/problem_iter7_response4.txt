[Prior reflection]
Prioritize tight fits using non-linear functions on surplus. Tune steepness/parameters for balanced preference. Consider decay rates. Experiment with simpler metrics too; directness can outperform complexity. Balance item/bin proportions.

    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    This heuristic balances prioritizing tight fits with a preference for
    bins that have a significant amount of remaining capacity relative to the item size,
    aiming for a more direct and potentially robust strategy.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit,
    the priority is calculated as:
    (remaining_capacity - item) / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon) + item / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon)

    This attempts to:
    1. Penalize large surpluses (first term: smaller values are better).
    2. Reward bins that are already quite full relative to the item being added (second term: larger values are better).
    The `epsilon` prevents division by zero.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

    # and also considers how much capacity is left.
    # A simpler approach: Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after packing is minimized.
    # Let's re-evaluate. The original sigmoid focused on minimizing `remaining_capacity - item`.
    # A simpler approach would be to directly use the "Best Fit" principle:
    # highest priority for the bin that leaves the smallest remaining capacity.
    # The score could be the inverse of the remaining capacity after packing.
    # To avoid issues with zero remaining capacity, we can add a small constant or use `1 / (1 + surplus)`.

    # `1 / (1 + surplus)` yields scores between 1 (surplus=0) and ~0 (large surplus).
    best_fit_scores = 1.0 / (1.0 + surplus)

    # Alternatively, consider the ratio of item size to current capacity.
    # Larger items in larger bins might be preferable to avoid fragmentation.
    # This is related to "Worst Fit Decreasing" ideas, but for online.
    # Let's stick to prioritizing tight fits, but maybe with a more direct metric.
    # The original sigmoid amplifies the difference. A simpler approach could be linear or inverse.

    # Let's try a different non-linear approach.
    # Prioritize bins with small surplus, but also consider the ratio of item to bin capacity.
    # A bin that is almost full and can fit the item is good.
    # A bin that is very empty and can fit the item might lead to fragmentation.

    # Revised strategy: Prioritize bins that result in a small *relative* surplus.
    # Relative surplus = (remaining_capacity - item) / initial_remaining_capacity
    # This also doesn't feel right for strict BPP. We want smallest number of bins.

    # Let's go back to the idea of minimizing `remaining_capacity - item`.
    # A simple inverse: `1.0 / (surplus + epsilon)` would prioritize tight fits.
    # But we need to consider bins that *can* fit.

    # Let's reconsider the reflection: "directness can outperform complexity. Balance item/bin proportions."
    # A simple "Best Fit" approach: The priority is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity *after* packing.
    # Priority = 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon)
    # This strongly favors the tightest fit.

    # Let's implement a direct "Best Fit" priority.
    # The highest priority should go to the bin that, after packing, has the LEAST remaining capacity.
    # So, priority is inversely related to `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and positive (tight fit), priority is high.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is large (loose fit), priority is low.

    # Let's use a simple inverse relationship, ensuring values are positive.
    # `1.0 / (surplus + epsilon)` where surplus = `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # This directly rewards smaller surpluses.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (surplus + epsilon)

    # Add a slight preference for bins that are already quite full *before* packing the item.
    # This might help consolidate items but could also lead to fragmentation if not careful.
    # Let's try a simple additive term: `item / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon)`.
    # This term increases as `bins_remain_cap` decreases for a given `item`.
    # It encourages packing into bins that are already mostly occupied.

    # Let's combine the "tightest fit" idea with "prefer fuller bins".
    # Score = (1 / (surplus + epsilon)) + (item / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] + epsilon))
    # This might over-prioritize very full bins where surplus is also small.

    # Re-thinking reflection: "Balance item/bin proportions."
    # Maybe prioritize bins that have a capacity *close* to the item size,
    # rather than just minimizing absolute surplus.
    # Priority ~ 1 / (abs(bins_remain_cap[i] - item) + epsilon) -- This is like Nearest Fit. Not ideal.

    # Let's stick to Best Fit principle, but perhaps with a decay.
    # Consider `1 / (1 + steepness * surplus)` from v1, but with different `steepness` or transformation.
    # What if we prioritize based on `item / bins_remain_cap[i]`? Higher ratio means bin is more "full" relative to item.
    # This is more like First Fit Decreasing logic, but for online choice of bin.

    # Let's go with a direct interpretation of "Best Fit" using inverse of surplus.
    # The priority is how much "waste" is left. We want to minimize waste.
    # Priority = 1 / (remaining_capacity_after_packing + epsilon)
    # This is equivalent to `1 / (surplus + epsilon)`.

    # Let's try a slightly different non-linear function.
    # Consider `exp(-k * surplus)`. This is similar to sigmoid but simpler.
    # As surplus increases, score decreases.
    k = 2.0 # Tunable parameter for steepness.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = np.exp(-k * surplus)

    # Let's refine this: ensure that very tight fits (small surplus) get the highest scores.
    # `exp(-k * surplus)` maps [0, inf) to (0, 1]. Surplus=0 gets 1.
    # This is good. It's a direct preference for minimum surplus.

    # Let's incorporate the "balance item/bin proportions" by penalizing very empty bins that fit the item.
    # For bins that can fit, let's consider `item / bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    # A higher ratio means the bin is relatively fuller for this item.
    # A simple approach: `priority = exp(-k * surplus) * (1 + item / bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])`
    # This multiplies the tight-fit score by a factor that prefers fuller bins.

    # Let's try to directly penalize "large empty bins being used".
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is very large, even if `surplus` is small, it might not be the best.
    # Consider the ratio `item / bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    # Maybe `priority = exp(-k * surplus) * (item / bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])`?
    # This would heavily favor bins that are already almost full and have a small surplus.
    # What if item is large? `item / bins_remain_cap[i]` could be close to 1.
    # What if item is small? `item / bins_remain_cap[i]` would be small.

    # Let's try a simpler, more direct approach inspired by "balance item/bin proportions" and "directness".
    # Prioritize bins that have a remaining capacity that is "just enough" for the item.
    # This is Best Fit. The direct metric is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`. Minimize this.
    # Priority = 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + epsilon) -- This is like inverse of waste.
    # Let's test this simple inverse:
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item + epsilon)

    # This directly gives the highest score to the bin with the smallest non-negative surplus.
    # It's a pure Best Fit strategy.
