System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Random Fit.

    In Random Fit, we randomly select a bin that can accommodate the item.
    The priority function here aims to simulate this by assigning higher priority
    to bins that can fit the item, and then introducing a random element to break ties
    and achieve the "random" aspect.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # A very small epsilon to avoid division by zero or issues with sigmoid at large values
    epsilon = 1e-9

    # Calculate the remaining capacity if the item is placed in each bin
    potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item

    # We want to find bins where potential_remaining_cap is close to 0 (perfect fit)
    # and also bins where potential_remaining_cap is significantly larger than the item
    # but not too large that it wastes space.
    # The sigmoid function can help us model this.
    # Let's map the "desirability" to a range.
    # A perfect fit (potential_remaining_cap = 0) should be highly desirable.
    # A very small remaining capacity (potential_remaining_cap < 0) is not possible.
    # A very large remaining capacity (potential_remaining_cap >> item) might be less desirable than a tight fit.

    # We'll use a sigmoid function. The input to the sigmoid will be related to
    # how "close" the remaining capacity is to some ideal value.
    # Let's aim for the ideal remaining capacity to be 0 (perfect fit).
    # The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` has an output between 0 and 1.
    # A larger input `x` results in a value closer to 1.
    # We want a high score when potential_remaining_cap is small and positive.
    # So, we can use `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ideal - x)))` where `ideal=0`.
    # This means `1 / (1 + exp(k * x))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-x)))`.
    # If `x` is the potential_remaining_cap, then `k*x` can be our sigmoid input.
    # A positive `x` means there's still space. We want smaller `x` to be better.
    # So, we want the sigmoid argument to be larger when `x` is small.
    # This suggests using `exp(-k * x)`.

    # Let's normalize the potential remaining capacity to be in a range where
    # sigmoid can effectively distinguish between good and bad fits.
    # The maximum possible remaining capacity is the original bin capacity (assuming
    # bins_remain_cap reflects this when no item is present).
    # However, we don't have the original bin capacity. We only have remaining.
    # A simpler approach might be to consider the 'waste' or 'tightness'.

    # Strategy: Use a sigmoid where the input is a scaled version of the
    # potential remaining capacity. We want bins with smaller potential_remaining_cap
    # to have higher scores (closer to 1), indicating a tighter fit.
    # However, we also need to consider that the item must fit.
    # Bins where potential_remaining_cap < 0 are invalid.

    valid_bins_mask = potential_remaining_cap >= 0

    # For valid bins, we want to prioritize those with smaller remaining capacity.
    # A simple approach is to invert the remaining capacity and scale it.
    # Or, use a sigmoid function that squashes larger positive values towards 0.
    # Sigmoid: 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
    # We want higher score for smaller positive remaining capacity.
    # Let's transform potential_remaining_cap to something like `-k * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # A higher score (closer to 1) means we want to pack into that bin.

    # Let's try to map the remaining capacity `r` to a score `s`.
    # We want:
    # - `s` close to 1 for small positive `r` (tight fit)
    # - `s` close to 0 for large positive `r` (wasteful fit)
    # - `s` = 0 for `r` < 0 (cannot fit)

    # The function `exp(-k*r)` would give higher values for smaller `r`.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(k * (max_waste - r))`.
    # Where `max_waste` is some target or a value that shifts the sigmoid.
    # If we don't know the original bin size, we can't establish a clear "waste".

    # Let's redefine the score: We want bins with remaining capacity `r` such that
    # `item` fits and `r` is minimized. This is the "Best Fit" heuristic.
    # The Sigmoid Fit Score could be an extension.

    # Consider a sigmoid centered around a "good" remaining capacity, perhaps near 0.
    # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(k * (x - c)))` where `x` is potential_remaining_cap.
    # If `c` is the ideal remaining capacity (e.g., 0), and `k` controls steepness.
    # For `x < c`, the score is high. For `x > c`, the score is low.

    # Let's use a sigmoid on the *negative* of the potential remaining capacity.
    # `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # We want `f(some_func(potential_remaining_cap))`
    # If `some_func(r) = -r`, then for small `r` (good), `-r` is large negative, sigmoid is near 0. This is wrong.
    # If `some_func(r) = r`, then for small `r` (good), sigmoid is near 0.5 or less. This is wrong.

    # Let's consider the complementary sigmoid: `1 - (1 / (1 + exp(-x))) = exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(x))`.
    # This function gives values near 1 for large negative `x`, and near 0 for large positive `x`.
    # If we use `1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))`:
    # - Small `potential_remaining_cap` (good) -> large negative `k * potential_remaining_cap` -> score near 1.
    # - Large `potential_remaining_cap` (bad) -> large positive `k * potential_remaining_cap` -> score near 0.
    # This seems like a good candidate for "Best Fit"-like behavior.

    # We need to choose a scaling factor `k`. A larger `k` makes the transition steeper.
    # A reasonable `k` could be related to the inverse of the typical item size or bin capacity,
    # but without that information, we can pick a general value.
    # Let's try k=1 for now.

    # Handle cases where item cannot fit. For these, priority is 0.
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    # Calculate scores for bins where the item fits
    # We want to prioritize bins with smaller remaining capacity *after* packing.
    # Let's map the remaining capacity `r` to a priority score.
    # We want higher priority for smaller `r` (where `r >= 0`).
    # Consider the function `g(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`
    # For `r=0` (perfect fit), `g(0) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`.
    # For `r > 0` and small, `g(r)` is slightly less than 0.5.
    # For `r > 0` and large, `g(r)` approaches 0.

    # This is good if we want to differentiate between tight fits and loose fits,
    # but it doesn't give a strong preference for the tightest fit if there are multiple
    # tight fits.

    # Let's reconsider the "ideal" remaining capacity.
    # The goal of bin packing is to minimize the number of bins.
    # For an online algorithm, a good strategy is to try and make fits as tight as possible
    # to leave larger spaces available for larger items.
    # So, the "best fit" strategy minimizes `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.

    # How to use Sigmoid to implement Best Fit?
    # Sigmoid is monotonic. We want a function that is decreasing with `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * x))` where `x` is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # `k` controls the steepness. A larger `k` means the preference for smaller `x` is stronger.

    # We need to choose a suitable value for `k`.
    # If the item size `item` is very small relative to `bins_remain_cap`, then `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`
    # is close to `bins_remain_cap[i]`. If `k` is too large, the scores might saturate too quickly.
    # If `k` is too small, the sigmoid is too flat, and it's almost a random choice.

    # Let's consider the "waste" which is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to minimize waste.
    # We can normalize the waste relative to something. If we knew the original bin capacity `C`,
    # we could normalize by `C`. Without `C`, we can normalize by the sum of remaining capacities
    # or the maximum remaining capacity, but that might be unstable.

    # A simple approach: Use sigmoid directly on the remaining capacity.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # If `r < 0`, it's invalid (priority 0).
    # If `r >= 0`, we want higher scores for smaller `r`.
    # Let's use `score = exp(-k * r)`. This gives higher scores for smaller `r`.
    # However, this score can be arbitrarily large if `r` is very negative.
    # We need to clip or use a bounded function like sigmoid.

    # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` where `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # A higher `k` means a stronger preference for smaller `r`.
    # A suitable `k` could be `1.0 / mean(bins_remain_cap)` or `1.0 / max(bins_remain_cap)` or similar,
    # but this requires knowing these values or estimating them.
    # For a general-purpose heuristic, a fixed moderate `k` is often used. Let's try `k=1`.
    # We need to be careful about potential_remaining_cap being zero or very close to zero.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap[i] = 0`, then `exp(k * 0) = 1`, score is 0.5. This is fine.

    # Consider the inverse of remaining capacity as a score for positive values:
    # For `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`:
    # If `r < 0`, priority is 0.
    # If `r == 0`, priority is high (perfect fit).
    # If `r > 0` and small, priority is high.
    # If `r > 0` and large, priority is low.

    # Let's use the sigmoid function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # We want to map `r` such that small `r` maps to large `x`.
    # So, let `x = -k * r`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`.
    # Where `r` is `potential_remaining_cap`.

    # We need to apply this only to valid bins.
    # Let's scale `k` perhaps by a small factor to avoid extreme values.
    # A factor related to item size might be useful if item sizes vary greatly.
    # E.g., `k = 1.0 / item` or `k = 1.0 / np.mean(bins_remain_cap)` etc.
    # Without specific context on typical capacities or item sizes,
    # let's use a tunable parameter `steepness`.
    steepness = 5.0  # Adjust this to control how strongly small remaining capacity is favored

    # For valid bins, calculate the sigmoid score.
    # We want smaller `potential_remaining_cap` to result in higher scores.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))` does this.
    # Where `r = potential_remaining_cap`.

    # To prevent potential numerical issues with large exponents,
    # we can add a small epsilon if needed, or clip values.
    # However, `np.exp` usually handles large inputs by returning inf,
    # which leads to division by inf (0) or division of 1 by (1+inf) which is 0.
    # And for very negative inputs, exp(very_negative) -> 0, so 1/(1+0) = 1.

    # Let's ensure `potential_remaining_cap` doesn't cause overflow in `exp`.
    # The exponent is `steepness * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large and positive, exponent is large positive, exp is inf, score is 0.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large and negative, exponent is large negative, exp is 0, score is 1.
    # But `potential_remaining_cap` cannot be arbitrarily negative, it's `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # The minimum value is when `bins_remain_cap` is small.

    # Let's cap the `potential_remaining_cap` for the sigmoid calculation to avoid issues
    # if `bins_remain_cap` values are extremely small or `item` is very large.
    # A reasonable cap could be related to the item size itself. If remaining capacity
    # is much larger than the item, it's likely a loose fit.
    # Let's clip `potential_remaining_cap` to a reasonable range, e.g., [-item, max_bin_capacity].
    # Without `max_bin_capacity`, let's use the maximum value of `bins_remain_cap` in the current set
    # as a proxy for scale.

    # A simpler approach: calculate directly for valid bins.
    # For valid bins (potential_remaining_cap >= 0):
    # Score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))
    # This will give scores between ~0 (for large remaining) and 0.5 (for zero remaining).
    # This is a bit counter-intuitive if we want "high score = high priority".

    # Let's try a function that maps small positive `r` to high scores.
    # `score = exp(-k * r)` could work if we bound the input or scale it.

    # Alternative Sigmoid strategy:
    # Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity is "just enough" or slightly more than the item.
    # This is "Best Fit" heuristic.
    # We want to maximize a function that is high when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and non-negative.
    # The function `sigmoid(alpha - beta * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))` can do this.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small, then `alpha - beta * small_positive` is large, sigmoid is near 1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is large, then `alpha - beta * large_positive` is small, sigmoid is near 0.
    # `alpha` shifts the sigmoid center. `beta` controls steepness.

    # Let's try to simplify this. We are essentially ranking based on `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # The heuristic is "prioritize bins with smallest non-negative remaining capacity".

    # A Sigmoid Fit Score can be formulated as prioritizing fits that leave a remainder close to 0.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to map `r` to a priority `p` such that:
    # p = 0 if r < 0
    # p is high for r close to 0
    # p is low for r large

    # The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is good for this if `x` is `k * r`.
    # Higher `k` means stronger preference for smaller `r`.
    # We need to ensure `x` doesn't cause overflow for `exp`.
    # If `r` is large positive, `x` is large positive, `exp(x)` is inf, `1/(1+inf)` is 0.
    # If `r` is zero, `x` is zero, `exp(x)` is 1, `1/(1+1)` is 0.5.
    # If `r` is negative, `x` is negative, `exp(x)` is small, `1/(1+small)` is close to 1.

    # This means `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` gives higher priority to bins that cannot fit the item
    # if we don't handle the `r < 0` case.

    # Let's make the score represent how "good" the fit is, from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).
    # A perfect fit (`r=0`) should have the highest score.
    # A large `r` should have a low score.
    # `r < 0` is invalid, score 0.

    # Consider `score = exp(-k * r)`. This is maximized at `r=0`.
    # But it's not bounded by 1 and can grow large.
    # To bound it, we can use `tanh`. `tanh(x)` goes from -1 to 1.
    # `tanh(k * r)`:
    #   - large negative r -> -1
    #   - r=0 -> 0
    #   - large positive r -> 1
    # We want high score for small positive `r`.

    # Let's try mapping the difference `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` to a "fit quality".
    # `fit_quality = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`. Higher is better.
    # Then use sigmoid on a scaled version.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * fit_quality))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`
    # This is the same as `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`.

    # The range of `bins_remain_cap` and `item` is important for choosing `k`.
    # If the range of `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is large, `k` might need to be smaller.
    # If the range is small, `k` can be larger.

    # Let's assume a typical scenario where item sizes and bin capacities are positive floats.
    # We want to favor bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and non-negative.

    # Using `np.clip` on the exponent argument to `np.exp` can prevent overflow.
    # The exponent is `steepness * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # Max positive value for `potential_remaining_cap` could be, say, `max(bins_remain_cap)`.
    # Min value could be `-item`.
    # Let's cap the exponent to a range like [-10, 10].

    # Calculate the exponent values for valid bins
    exponent_values = steepness * potential_remaining_cap[valid_bins_mask]

    # Clip exponent values to avoid overflow/underflow issues in exp
    # A range of [-20, 20] for the exponent is usually safe for standard float types.
    # exp(20) is ~4.8e8, exp(-20) is ~2e-9.
    clipped_exponent_values = np.clip(exponent_values, -20, 20)

    # Calculate the sigmoid scores for valid bins using the clipped exponents
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` gives higher values for smaller `x`.
    # We want higher values for smaller `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # So, we want `x` to be `-k * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # Let's rewrite: `score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # For small `potential_remaining_cap` (e.g., 0.1), `exp(steepness * 0.1)` is large, score is small. This is not what we want.

    # We need a function that gives higher scores for smaller positive `r`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * r))` increases as `r` decreases.
    # If `r` is small positive, `-steepness * r` is small negative, exp is close to 0, score is ~1.
    # If `r` is large positive, `-steepness * r` is large negative, exp is close to 0, score is ~1. This is not right.

    # Let's go back to the `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` formulation.
    # This function `f(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` is DECREASING in `r`.
    # So, smaller `r` (good) leads to higher `f(r)`.
    # If `r = 0` (perfect fit), `f(0) = 0.5`.
    # If `r` is slightly positive, `f(r)` is slightly less than 0.5.
    # If `r` is large positive, `f(r)` approaches 0.
    # If `r` is slightly negative, `f(r)` is slightly more than 0.5.
    # If `r` is very negative, `f(r)` approaches 1.

    # This implies that bins that CANNOT fit the item (`r < 0`) would get the HIGHEST priority if we use this directly.
    # This is exactly the opposite of what we want.

    # How to achieve:
    # Priority = 0 for r < 0
    # Priority = high for r = 0
    # Priority = medium for small positive r
    # Priority = low for large positive r

    # Consider the "gap" heuristic: Prioritize bins with `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`.
    # Among these, select the one with minimum `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # This is "Best Fit".

    # Let's try a sigmoid centered at 0 with a negative slope.
    # `sigmoid(center - steepness * value)`
    # We want value = `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want high scores when `value` is small and positive.
    # Let `value = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # Let `score = sigmoid(C - k * value)` where `k > 0`.
    # Example: `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-(C - k * value))) = 1 / (1 + exp(-C + k * value))`
    # If `value` is small positive, `k*value` is small positive. `-C + k*value` is large negative (if C is large). exp->0, score->1.
    # If `value` is large positive, `k*value` is large positive. `-C + k*value` is large positive. exp->inf, score->0.

    # This seems correct. We need to choose `C` and `k`.
    # `C` can be thought of as a threshold for how "loose" a fit is acceptable.
    # If we want to prioritize fits that are "just enough", `C` could be related to 0.
    # `k` determines the sensitivity to the difference.

    # Let's set `C = 0` and `k = steepness`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`
    # This is the function we analyzed that was decreasing.
    # It gives:
    #   - r < 0 => score > 0.5 (approaching 1)
    #   - r = 0 => score = 0.5
    #   - r > 0 => score < 0.5 (approaching 0)

    # This means it strongly prefers bins that CANNOT fit the item, which is WRONG.

    # The problem is applying sigmoid directly to remaining capacity.
    # A true Sigmoid Fit Score for Best Fit might involve fitting a sigmoid to
    # the points `(r, priority_for_r)`.

    # Let's simplify the objective: Among valid bins, we want the one with minimal `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # This is like finding the minimum.
    # We can use sigmoid to create a "soft" minimum.

    # A different approach: The sigmoid could represent the probability of selecting a bin.
    # We want higher probability for bins that are "tight".
    # Let's use `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (target_rem_cap - actual_rem_cap)))`
    # Where `target_rem_cap` is the ideal remaining capacity. Ideally 0.
    # `actual_rem_cap` is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.

    # Score = `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (0 - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))))`
    # Score = `1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`

    # This is the same decreasing function. The core issue is that negative remainders
    # are treated as "very good fits" by this function's structure.

    # How about creating a piecewise score?
    # For `r < 0`: score = 0
    # For `r >= 0`: score = `sigmoid(k * (MaxPossibleDiff - r))` where MaxPossibleDiff is some large value.
    # Or `sigmoid(k * (-r))`?
    # `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-r))) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`. Still the decreasing function.

    # Let's use a sigmoid to rank the "goodness" of the remaining space.
    # The more remaining space `r`, the less desirable the bin might be for a tight packing strategy.
    # Consider mapping `r` to `score = sigmoid(gain - steepness * r)`
    # Let `gain` be some offset.
    # If we set `gain = 0`, we have `sigmoid(-steepness * r) = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))`.

    # What if the sigmoid is applied to the inverse of the remaining capacity?
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon))))`
    # For `r` near 0, `1/r` is large positive. `score` approaches 1.
    # For `r` large, `1/r` is near 0. `score` approaches 0.5.
    # This looks promising!

    # Let's define the priority:
    # For bins where `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`:
    # Let `value = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # We want high score for small `value`.
    # Consider `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (C - value)))` where `k > 0`.
    # To make it prefer small `value`, we need `k` and `C` to be tuned.
    # If `C = 0`, score is `1 / (1 + exp(k * value))`. This is decreasing.

    # Let's use a simpler sigmoid transformation for "best fit" behavior:
    # For bins where `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`, we want to score them based on how small `potential_remaining_cap` is.
    # This is equivalent to ranking them from smallest `potential_remaining_cap` to largest.

    # The Sigmoid Fit Score strategy aims to find a sweet spot in remaining capacity,
    # or to strongly favor tight fits.

    # Let's try prioritizing based on `1 - sigmoid(k * remaining_capacity)`.
    # If `remaining_capacity` is small positive, `k*r` is small positive, sigmoid is >0.5. `1-sigmoid` is <0.5. Bad.
    # If `remaining_capacity` is large positive, `k*r` is large positive, sigmoid is near 1. `1-sigmoid` is near 0. Good. This is favoring loose fits.

    # It seems the interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score" needs to be clear.
    # If it's about "how close to a perfect fit (remainder=0)", then `1/(1+exp(k*(r-0)))` is decreasing, so smallest `r` gives highest score.

    # Let's define the score more concretely:
    # The priority score for a bin `i` should be high if `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item` AND `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimized.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want a function `f(r)` such that:
    # f(r) = 0 for r < 0
    # f(r) is decreasing for r >= 0.

    # Let's try a sigmoid on `k * (large_value - r)`
    # Consider the score to be a transformed version of `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # We want small non-negative `potential_remaining_cap` to get high scores.
    # Let `score_raw = -potential_remaining_cap`. Higher `score_raw` is better.
    # Then apply sigmoid: `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * score_raw))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # Again, this favors negative `potential_remaining_cap` which means item doesn't fit.

    # Let's adjust the target. The goal is to have a small, but potentially non-zero, remaining capacity.
    # This can leave room for items of slightly different sizes, or perhaps encourage future fits.
    # However, for "Best Fit", we want remainder exactly 0.

    # Consider the objective: maximize `1 / (1 + exp(k * (r - C)))` for `r >= 0`.
    # This function is maximized when `r - C` is minimized (most negative).
    # If `C = 0`, then maximized when `r` is most negative.

    # Let's try mapping `potential_remaining_cap` to a priority.
    # The closer `potential_remaining_cap` is to `item`'s original size, the better. No, this is First Fit Decreasing.
    # The closer `potential_remaining_cap` is to 0, the better.

    # A reasonable "Sigmoid Fit Score" could be based on how well the item fills the bin relative to its remaining capacity.
    # For valid bins: `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`
    # Score based on `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to give high scores to bins with `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` close to 0.

    # Let's use `sigmoid(gain - k * difference)` where `difference = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-(gain - k * difference)))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * difference - gain))`

    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # If we want a "perfect fit" to be ideal, we want `difference = 0` to have the highest score.
    # `score(0) = 1 / (1 + exp(-gain))`
    # If `difference > 0`, `k*difference` is larger positive. `score` will be less than `score(0)`.
    # If `difference < 0` (item does not fit), we want score = 0.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * difference - gain))` needs to be 0 for `difference < 0`.
    # This means `k * difference - gain` should be very large positive for `difference < 0`.
    # Let's set `gain = k * target_difference`. If target is 0, `gain = 0`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * difference))`
    # This function is decreasing, but `difference < 0` gives higher scores than `difference = 0`.

    # The core issue is that sigmoid is monotonic. We need to apply it to a quantity that is ranked correctly.
    # The ranking we want is: (small `r` >= 0) > (large `r` >= 0) > ( `r` < 0)

    # Let's modify the sigmoid's input:
    # For valid bins, calculate `priorities[i] = sigmoid(-k * potential_remaining_cap[i])`
    # `sigmoid(-x) = 1 - sigmoid(x)`.
    # So `priorities[i] = 1 - sigmoid(k * potential_remaining_cap[i])`
    # `priorities[i] = 1 - 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap[i]))`
    # `priorities[i] = exp(k * potential_remaining_cap[i]) / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap[i]))`
    # This is also `sigmoid(-k * potential_remaining_cap[i])`.

    # Let `r = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # `sigmoid(-k * r)`:
    #   - If `r` is small positive (good fit), `-k*r` is small negative. sigmoid is < 0.5.
    #   - If `r` is large positive (bad fit), `-k*r` is large negative. sigmoid is close to 0.
    #   - If `r` is zero, `-k*r` is zero. sigmoid is 0.5.
    #   - If `r` is negative (cannot fit), `-k*r` is positive. sigmoid is > 0.5.

    # This still ranks negative remaining capacities as "better" than 0 remaining capacity.

    # The "Sigmoid Fit Score" could be a way to smooth the ranking.
    # Let's use a function that prioritizes minimum `potential_remaining_cap` among valid bins.
    # The score for a bin should be `f(potential_remaining_cap)`.
    # `f` should be decreasing for `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`.

    # A simple approach is to use a large sigmoid value for small `r`.
    # What if we map `potential_remaining_cap` to `r_mapped = C - k * potential_remaining_cap`?
    # Then apply sigmoid: `score = sigmoid(r_mapped)`.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap` close to 0, we want `r_mapped` to be large positive.
    # This implies `C` should be large, or `-k` should be large positive. So `k` is negative.
    # But we used `k>0` for steepness.

    # Let's invert the interpretation. Let's say `score = sigmoid(k * (C - potential_remaining_cap))`
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is small, `C - potential_remaining_cap` is large, sigmoid -> 1.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large, `C - potential_remaining_cap` is small, sigmoid -> low.
    # This seems correct for valid bins!

    # We need to handle invalid bins (score = 0).
    # And we need to choose `C` and `k`.
    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # A good choice for `C` would be something that represents a "neutral" point.
    # If `C=0`, then `score = sigmoid(k * (-potential_remaining_cap)) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # This is the decreasing function we already analyzed.

    # Let's adjust the scaling and shift.
    # The goal is that for `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`:
    # small values get scores close to 1.
    # large values get scores close to 0.

    # Let `y = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # Consider a function like `exp(-k * y)`. This is decreasing.
    # Let's scale and shift it within sigmoid:
    # `score = sigmoid(alpha + beta * y)` where `beta` is negative.
    # `score = sigmoid(alpha - beta_abs * y)` where `beta_abs > 0`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-(alpha - beta_abs * y)))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(beta_abs * y - alpha))`
    # This is `1 / (1 + exp(k * (y - alpha/k)))`.
    # So it's `1 / (1 + exp(k * (y - C)))`. Where `C = alpha/k`.

    # This means `1 / (1 + exp(k * (potential_remaining_cap - C)))` is a decreasing function.
    # It will give high scores for small `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # We need to set `C` and `k`.
    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # If `C` is the target "best fit" remaining capacity, which is 0.
    # Then `score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # This function gives:
    # r = 0 -> score = 0.5
    # r > 0 -> score < 0.5
    # r < 0 -> score > 0.5

    # So, to make it work, we must explicitly set scores to 0 for invalid bins.
    # For valid bins, the score `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # will rank bins with smaller `potential_remaining_cap` higher.

    # Let's implement this.
    # The "strength" of preference for tighter fits will be controlled by `steepness`.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    # Find bins where the item can fit
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item

    # For bins that can fit the item, calculate the sigmoid priority score.
    # The function 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * remaining_capacity)) gives higher scores for smaller remaining_capacity.
    # A steepness of, say, 5.0 means the score will drop significantly as remaining capacity increases beyond a small value.

    # Calculate exponent argument. Use potential_remaining_cap for valid bins.
    exponent_args = steepness * potential_remaining_cap[can_fit_mask]

    # Clip exponent arguments to prevent overflow/underflow.
    # Values too large positive (e.g., > 700 for double precision exp) result in 0.
    # Values too large negative (e.g., < -700) result in 1.
    # A range of [-20, 20] for the argument of `exp` usually gives reasonable output.
    clipped_exponent_args = np.clip(exponent_args, -30, 30) # Slightly larger range for safety

    # Calculate the priority scores for valid bins.
    # Using the formulation that gives higher priority to smaller remaining capacity:
    # score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))
    # Where r = potential_remaining_cap.
    # For r = 0, score = 0.5. For r > 0, score < 0.5. For r << 0, score >> 0.5.
    # This is NOT the desired behavior for "best fit".

    # Let's try the opposite sigmoid's input.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * r))`
    # This function `g(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*r))` is INCREASING in `r`.
    #   - r = 0 -> score = 0.5
    #   - r > 0 -> score > 0.5
    #   - r < 0 -> score < 0.5

    # This means it favors bins with *larger* remaining capacity. This is "Worst Fit".

    # The "Sigmoid Fit Score" strategy needs to assign higher scores to bins
    # where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and non-negative.

    # Let's define the score based on the "tightness" of the fit.
    # Tightness: `1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)` for `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`.
    # This gives a large score for `r` near 0.
    # Then apply sigmoid to this mapped value.
    # Let `scaled_tightness = k * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon))`
    # Score = `sigmoid(scaled_tightness)` = `1 / (1 + exp(-scaled_tightness))`
    # Score = `1 / (1 + exp(-k / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)))`

    # Let's test this.
    # `r` is `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # If `r` is very small positive (e.g., 1e-5):
    #   `1.0 / (r + epsilon)` is large positive.
    #   `-k / (r + epsilon)` is large negative.
    #   `exp(...)` is close to 0.
    #   `score` is close to 1. (GOOD)
    # If `r` is large positive (e.g., 100):
    #   `1.0 / (r + epsilon)` is close to 0.
    #   `-k / (r + epsilon)` is close to 0.
    #   `exp(...)` is close to 1.
    #   `score` is close to 0.5. (OK, but we want lower score for larger `r`).

    # This seems to prioritize smaller remaining capacities well.
    # We need to ensure `epsilon` is small enough and chosen wisely.

    # Let's refine: `steepness` controls the slope.
    # `priorities = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)))`

    # Handling invalid bins:
    # For `can_fit_mask[i] == False`, priority is 0.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to prevent division by zero

    # Calculate remaining capacity only for bins where item can fit
    valid_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    potential_remaining_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins_mask] - item

    # For valid bins, calculate a measure of "tightness"
    # `tightness_measure = 1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)`
    # This value is large when `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is small.

    # Apply sigmoid to a scaled version of this tightness measure.
    # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` increases with `x`.
    # We want score to increase with tightness.
    # Let `x = steepness * tightness_measure`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon))))`

    # Let's test `steepness = 5.0`.
    # `r = 0.01` (small positive remaining capacity)
    #   `tightness = 1.0 / (0.01 + 1e-9) approx 100`
    #   `x = 5.0 * 100 = 500`
    #   `exp(-500)` is very close to 0.
    #   `score = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1`. (Excellent score)

    # `r = 10.0` (larger remaining capacity)
    #   `tightness = 1.0 / (10.0 + 1e-9) approx 0.1`
    #   `x = 5.0 * 0.1 = 0.5`
    #   `exp(-0.5) approx 0.606`
    #   `score = 1 / (1 + 0.606) approx 0.623`. (Decent score, lower than 1)

    # `r = 0.0` (perfect fit)
    #   `tightness = 1.0 / (0.0 + 1e-9) = 1e9` (very large)
    #   `x = 5.0 * 1e9` (very large)
    #   `exp(-x)` is extremely close to 0.
    #   `score = 1`.

    # This formulation seems robust for prioritizing bins with the smallest non-negative remaining capacity.
    # `steepness` controls how aggressively we penalize larger remaining capacities.

    # Handle potential overflow in `exp` if `steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)` is very large negative.
    # This happens if `potential_remaining_cap` is large positive.
    # If `steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)` becomes very small negative, exp is ~1, score is 0.5.
    # If it becomes very large negative, exp is ~0, score is 1. This is the issue.

    # Let's ensure the argument to `exp` is within a safe range.
    # The argument is `-steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)`.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is small positive, the argument is large negative.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large positive, the argument is small negative.

    # Let `arg = -steepness / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)`
    # If `arg` is very negative (e.g., < -30), `exp(arg)` -> 0, score -> 1.
    # If `arg` is very positive (e.g., > 30), `exp(arg)` -> inf, score -> 0.

    # We want scores to be high for small `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # This means `arg` should be large negative. This gives score near 1.
    # For larger `potential_remaining_cap`, `arg` becomes less negative or even positive.
    # If `arg` is close to 0, score is 0.5.
    # If `arg` is positive, score is < 0.5.

    # So, `score = 1 / (1 + exp(arg))` where `arg = -steepness * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon))`.
    # Let's clip `arg` to avoid overflow/underflow for `exp`.
    # We want to avoid `arg` becoming extremely large negative or extremely large positive.
    # `arg` can be very large negative if `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is close to 0.
    # `arg` is close to 0 if `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is very large.

    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is close to zero, `1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)` is large.
    # Then `arg` is large negative. `exp(arg)` is near 0. `score` is near 1. (Good)
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is very large, `1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)` is close to zero.
    # Then `arg` is close to 0. `exp(arg)` is near 1. `score` is near 0.5. (This means larger remaining capacity gets score 0.5, which is not strictly worse than optimal 0.5 for perfect fit).

    # To make larger remaining capacities get lower scores, we might need to modify this.
    # Perhaps `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))` but inverted or shifted.

    # Let's use the previous formulation that seemed to work:
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (C - value)))`
    # where `value = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * value - C))`

    # We want higher scores for smaller `value`.
    # This function is decreasing if `k > 0`.

    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # We need `C` to position the sigmoid.
    # If we set `C` to a value that makes `k * C` equal to the "median" difference, or related to typical differences.

    # Let's try to use `sigmoid(k * (max_diff - r))` where `max_diff` is a large constant or max possible diff.
    # If `r=0`, `sigmoid(k*max_diff)` -> 1.
    # If `r=max_diff`, `sigmoid(0)` -> 0.5.
    # If `r > max_diff`, `sigmoid(-ve)` -> <0.5.

    # The function should prioritize smallest `r >= 0`.
    # Let `f(r)` be the priority score for `r`.
    # `f(0)` highest, `f(large_r)` lower.

    # Let's consider the function `1 / (1 + exp(-k * r))` but on a transformed `r`.
    # If we transform `r` such that it's large positive when `r` is small, and small negative when `r` is large.
    # This is what `1.0 / (r + epsilon)` does, but the range might not be ideal for sigmoid.

    # Let's cap `potential_remaining_cap` for the "good" range.
    # Say, anything greater than `item * 2` is considered "very loose".

    # Let's retry the formulation that promotes small positive remainders.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (r - C)))` where `k>0`.
    # This is a decreasing function. To get high scores for small `r`, we need `r-C` to be small (most negative).
    # This means `C` should be the target value, and if `r` is below `C`, score is high.
    # The ideal target is `r = 0`. So `C = 0`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`.

    # Re-evaluation of `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` for `r = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # `k > 0`.
    # `r < 0` (invalid fit): `k*r` is negative. `exp(k*r)` is < 1. `1 / (1 + exp)` is > 0.5. (high priority)
    # `r = 0` (perfect fit): `k*r` is 0. `exp(0) = 1`. `1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`. (medium priority)
    # `r > 0` (loose fit): `k*r` is positive. `exp(k*r)` is > 1. `1 / (1 + exp)` is < 0.5. (low priority)

    # This function, `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`, strongly prefers bins that CANNOT fit the item.
    # This is the opposite of "Best Fit".

    # We need a score that increases as `r` decreases for `r >= 0`.
    # And is 0 for `r < 0`.

    # Let's define a transformation:
    # `transformed_r = -r` for `r >= 0`
    # `transformed_r = very_small_number` for `r < 0`
    # Then apply `sigmoid(k * transformed_r)`.

    # `transformed_r` for valid bins: `-potential_remaining_cap_valid`
    # For invalid bins, `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is not applicable.
    # For valid bins `r >= 0`: We want `f(r)` to be decreasing.
    # `f(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` works.
    # BUT we need to ensure that bins where `r < 0` get score 0.

    # Let's combine:
    # For `i` where `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`: `priorities[i] = 0.0`
    # For `i` where `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:
    #   `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`
    #   `priorities[i] = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))`

    # This seems to be the most sensible application of the sigmoid to achieve "Best Fit" ranking.
    # `steepness` controls how sharply the priority drops as remaining capacity increases.
    # A higher `steepness` means a stronger preference for tight fits.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    steepness = 5.0  # Tunable parameter for sigmoid steepness

    # Identify bins where the item can fit
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # Calculate remaining capacity for these valid bins
    potential_remaining_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # Calculate the sigmoid score for valid bins.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` decreases as `x` increases.
    # We want higher scores for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # So, we use `x = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # This means the scores are higher for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.

    exponent_args = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid

    # Clip arguments to exp to prevent overflow/underflow.
    # If `exponent_args` is large positive (>30), exp -> inf, score -> 0.
    # If `exponent_args` is large negative (<-30), exp -> 0, score -> 1.
    clipped_exponent_args = np.clip(exponent_args, -30.0, 30.0)

    # A very small remaining capacity (potential_remaining_cap < 0) is not possible.
    # A very large remaining capacity (potential_remaining_cap >> item) might be less desirable than a tight fit.

    # We'll use a sigmoid function. The input to the sigmoid will be related to
    # how "close" the remaining capacity is to some ideal value.
    # Let's aim for the ideal remaining capacity to be 0 (perfect fit).
    # The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` has an output between 0 and 1.
    # A larger input `x` results in a value closer to 1.
    # We want a high score when potential_remaining_cap is small and positive.

    # A positive `x` means there's still space. We want smaller `x` to be better.
    # So, we want the sigmoid argument to be larger when `x` is small.
    # This suggests using `exp(-k * x)`.

    # Let's normalize the potential remaining capacity to be in a range where
    # sigmoid can effectively distinguish between good and bad fits.
    # The maximum possible remaining capacity is the original bin capacity (assuming
    # bins_remain_cap reflects this when no item is present).
    # However, we don't have the original bin capacity. We only have remaining.
    # A simpler approach might be to consider the 'waste' or 'tightness'.

    # Let's transform potential_remaining_cap to something like `-k * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # A higher score (closer to 1) means we want to pack into that bin.

    # We want:
    # - `s` close to 1 for small positive `r` (tight fit)
    # - `s` close to 0 for large positive `r` (wasteful fit)
    # - `s` = 0 for `r` < 0 (cannot fit)

    # The function `exp(-k*r)` would give higher values for smaller `r`.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(k * (max_waste - r))`.
    # Where `max_waste` is some target or a value that shifts the sigmoid.
    # If we don't know the original bin size, we can't establish a clear "waste".

    # Let's redefine the score: We want bins with remaining capacity `r` such that
    # `item` fits and `r` is minimized. This is the "Best Fit" heuristic.
    # The Sigmoid Fit Score could be an extension.

    # Consider a sigmoid centered around a "good" remaining capacity, perhaps near 0.

    # If `some_func(r) = -r`, then for small `r` (good), `-r` is large negative, sigmoid is near 0. This is wrong.
    # If `some_func(r) = r`, then for small `r` (good), sigmoid is near 0.5 or less. This is wrong.

    # Let's consider the complementary sigmoid: `1 - (1 / (1 + exp(-x))) = exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x))` which is `1 / (1 + exp(x))`.
    # This function gives values near 1 for large negative `x`, and near 0 for large positive `x`.
    # If we use `1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))`:
    # - Small `potential_remaining_cap` (good) -> large negative `k * potential_remaining_cap` -> score near 1.
    # - Large `potential_remaining_cap` (bad) -> large positive `k * potential_remaining_cap` -> score near 0.
    # This seems like a good candidate for "Best Fit"-like behavior.

    # We need to choose a scaling factor `k`. A larger `k` makes the transition steeper.
    # A reasonable `k` could be related to the inverse of the typical item size or bin capacity,
    # but without that information, we can pick a general value.
    # Let's try k=1 for now.

    # Handle cases where item cannot fit. For these, priority is 0.
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    # Calculate scores for bins where the item fits
    # We want to prioritize bins with smaller remaining capacity *after* packing.
    # Let's map the remaining capacity `r` to a priority score.
    # We want higher priority for smaller `r` (where `r >= 0`).
    # Consider the function `g(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`
    # For `r=0` (perfect fit), `g(0) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`.
    # For `r > 0` and small, `g(r)` is slightly less than 0.5.
    # For `r > 0` and large, `g(r)` approaches 0.

    # This is good if we want to differentiate between tight fits and loose fits,
    # but it doesn't give a strong preference for the tightest fit if there are multiple
    # tight fits.

    # Let's reconsider the "ideal" remaining capacity.
    # The goal of bin packing is to minimize the number of bins.
    # For an online algorithm, a good strategy is to try and make fits as tight as possible
    # to leave larger spaces available for larger items.
    # So, the "best fit" strategy minimizes `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.

    # How to use Sigmoid to implement Best Fit?
    # Sigmoid is monotonic. We want a function that is decreasing with `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * x))` where `x` is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # `k` controls the steepness. A larger `k` means the preference for smaller `x` is stronger.

    # We need to choose a suitable value for `k`.
    # If the item size `item` is very small relative to `bins_remain_cap`, then `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`
    # is close to `bins_remain_cap[i]`. If `k` is too large, the scores might saturate too quickly.
    # If `k` is too small, the sigmoid is too flat, and it's almost a random choice.

    # Let's consider the "waste" which is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to minimize waste.
    # We can normalize the waste relative to something. If we knew the original bin capacity `C`,
    # we could normalize by `C`. Without `C`, we can normalize by the sum of remaining capacities
    # or the maximum remaining capacity, but that might be unstable.

    # A simple approach: Use sigmoid directly on the remaining capacity.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # If `r < 0`, it's invalid (priority 0).
    # If `r >= 0`, we want higher scores for smaller `r`.
    # Let's use `score = exp(-k * r)`. This gives higher scores for smaller `r`.
    # However, this score can be arbitrarily large if `r` is very negative.
    # We need to clip or use a bounded function like sigmoid.

    # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` where `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # A higher `k` means a stronger preference for smaller `r`.
    # A suitable `k` could be `1.0 / mean(bins_remain_cap)` or `1.0 / max(bins_remain_cap)` or similar,
    # but this requires knowing these values or estimating them.
    # For a general-purpose heuristic, a fixed moderate `k` is often used. Let's try `k=1`.
    # We need to be careful about potential_remaining_cap being zero or very close to zero.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap[i] = 0`, then `exp(k * 0) = 1`, score is 0.5. This is fine.

    # Consider the inverse of remaining capacity as a score for positive values:
    # For `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`:
    # If `r < 0`, priority is 0.
    # If `r == 0`, priority is high (perfect fit).
    # If `r > 0` and small, priority is high.
    # If `r > 0` and large, priority is low.

    # Let's use the sigmoid function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # We want to map `r` such that small `r` maps to large `x`.
    # So, let `x = -k * r`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`.
    # Where `r` is `potential_remaining_cap`.

    # We need to apply this only to valid bins.
    # Let's scale `k` perhaps by a small factor to avoid extreme values.
    # A factor related to item size might be useful if item sizes vary greatly.
    # E.g., `k = 1.0 / item` or `k = 1.0 / np.mean(bins_remain_cap)` etc.
    # Without specific context on typical capacities or item sizes,
    # let's use a tunable parameter `steepness`.
    steepness = 5.0  # Adjust this to control how strongly small remaining capacity is favored

    # For valid bins, calculate the sigmoid score.
    # We want smaller `potential_remaining_cap` to result in higher scores.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))` does this.
    # Where `r = potential_remaining_cap`.

    # To prevent potential numerical issues with large exponents,
    # we can add a small epsilon if needed, or clip values.
    # However, `np.exp` usually handles large inputs by returning inf,
    # which leads to division by inf (0) or division of 1 by (1+inf) which is 0.
    # And for very negative inputs, exp(very_negative) -> 0, so 1/(1+0) = 1.

    # Let's ensure `potential_remaining_cap` doesn't cause overflow in `exp`.
    # The exponent is `steepness * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large and positive, exponent is large positive, exp is inf, score is 0.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large and negative, exponent is large negative, exp is 0, score is 1.
    # But `potential_remaining_cap` cannot be arbitrarily negative, it's `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # The minimum value is when `bins_remain_cap` is small.

    # Let's cap the `potential_remaining_cap` for the sigmoid calculation to avoid issues
    # if `bins_remain_cap` values are extremely small or `item` is very large.
    # A reasonable cap could be related to the item size itself. If remaining capacity
    # is much larger than the item, it's likely a loose fit.
    # Let's clip `potential_remaining_cap` to a reasonable range, e.g., [-item, max_bin_capacity].
    # Without `max_bin_capacity`, let's use the maximum value of `bins_remain_cap` in the current set
    # as a proxy for scale.

    # A simpler approach: calculate directly for valid bins.
    # For valid bins (potential_remaining_cap >= 0):
    # Score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))
    # This will give scores between ~0 (for large remaining) and 0.5 (for zero remaining).
    # This is a bit counter-intuitive if we want "high score = high priority".

    # Let's try a function that maps small positive `r` to high scores.
    # `score = exp(-k * r)` could work if we bound the input or scale it.

    # Alternative Sigmoid strategy:
    # Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity is "just enough" or slightly more than the item.
    # This is "Best Fit" heuristic.
    # We want to maximize a function that is high when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and non-negative.
    # The function `sigmoid(alpha - beta * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))` can do this.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small, then `alpha - beta * small_positive` is large, sigmoid is near 1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is large, then `alpha - beta * large_positive` is small, sigmoid is near 0.
    # `alpha` shifts the sigmoid center. `beta` controls steepness.

    # Let's try to simplify this. We are essentially ranking based on `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # The heuristic is "prioritize bins with smallest non-negative remaining capacity".

    # A Sigmoid Fit Score can be formulated as prioritizing fits that leave a remainder close to 0.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to map `r` to a priority `p` such that:
    # p = 0 if r < 0
    # p is high for r close to 0
    # p is low for r large

    # The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is good for this if `x` is `k * r`.
    # Higher `k` means stronger preference for smaller `r`.
    # We need to ensure `x` doesn't cause overflow for `exp`.
    # If `r` is large positive, `x` is large positive, `exp(x)` is inf, `1/(1+inf)` is 0.
    # If `r` is zero, `x` is zero, `exp(x)` is 1, `1/(1+1)` is 0.5.
    # If `r` is negative, `x` is negative, `exp(x)` is small, `1/(1+small)` is close to 1.

    # This means `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` gives higher priority to bins that cannot fit the item
    # if we don't handle the `r < 0` case.

    # Let's make the score represent how "good" the fit is, from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).
    # A perfect fit (`r=0`) should have the highest score.
    # A large `r` should have a low score.
    # `r < 0` is invalid, score 0.

    # Consider `score = exp(-k * r)`. This is maximized at `r=0`.
    # But it's not bounded by 1 and can grow large.
    # To bound it, we can use `tanh`. `tanh(x)` goes from -1 to 1.
    # `tanh(k * r)`:
    #   - large negative r -> -1
    #   - r=0 -> 0
    #   - large positive r -> 1
    # We want high score for small positive `r`.

    # Let's try mapping the difference `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` to a "fit quality".
    # `fit_quality = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`. Higher is better.
    # Then use sigmoid on a scaled version.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * fit_quality))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`
    # This is the same as `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`.

    # The range of `bins_remain_cap` and `item` is important for choosing `k`.
    # If the range of `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is large, `k` might need to be smaller.
    # If the range is small, `k` can be larger.

    # Let's assume a typical scenario where item sizes and bin capacities are positive floats.
    # We want to favor bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and non-negative.

    # Using `np.clip` on the exponent argument to `np.exp` can prevent overflow.
    # The exponent is `steepness * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # Max positive value for `potential_remaining_cap` could be, say, `max(bins_remain_cap)`.
    # Min value could be `-item`.
    # Let's cap the exponent to a range like [-10, 10].

    # Calculate the exponent values for valid bins
    exponent_values = steepness * potential_remaining_cap[valid_bins_mask]

    # Clip exponent values to avoid overflow/underflow issues in exp
    # A range of [-20, 20] for the exponent is usually safe for standard float types.
    # exp(20) is ~4.8e8, exp(-20) is ~2e-9.
    clipped_exponent_values = np.clip(exponent_values, -20, 20)

    # Calculate the sigmoid scores for valid bins using the clipped exponents
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` gives higher values for smaller `x`.
    # We want higher values for smaller `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # So, we want `x` to be `-k * potential_remaining_cap`.
    # Let's rewrite: `score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # For small `potential_remaining_cap` (e.g., 0.1), `exp(steepness * 0.1)` is large, score is small. This is not what we want.

    # We need a function that gives higher scores for smaller positive `r`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * r))` increases as `r` decreases.
    # If `r` is small positive, `-steepness * r` is small negative, exp is close to 0, score is ~1.
    # If `r` is large positive, `-steepness * r` is large negative, exp is close to 0, score is ~1. This is not right.

    # Let's go back to the `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` formulation.
    # This function `f(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` is DECREASING in `r`.
    # So, smaller `r` (good) leads to higher `f(r)`.
    # If `r = 0` (perfect fit), `f(0) = 0.5`.
    # If `r` is slightly positive, `f(r)` is slightly less than 0.5.
    # If `r` is large positive, `f(r)` approaches 0.
    # If `r` is slightly negative, `f(r)` is slightly more than 0.5.
    # If `r` is very negative, `f(r)` approaches 1.

    # This implies that bins that CANNOT fit the item (`r < 0`) would get the HIGHEST priority if we use this directly.
    # This is exactly the opposite of what we want.

    # How to achieve:
    # Priority = 0 for r < 0
    # Priority = high for r = 0
    # Priority = medium for small positive r
    # Priority = low for large positive r

    # Consider the "gap" heuristic: Prioritize bins with `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`.
    # Among these, select the one with minimum `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # This is "Best Fit".

    # Let's try a sigmoid centered at 0 with a negative slope.
    # `sigmoid(center - steepness * value)`
    # We want value = `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want high scores when `value` is small and positive.
    # Let `value = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # Let `score = sigmoid(C - k * value)` where `k > 0`.
    # Example: `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-(C - k * value))) = 1 / (1 + exp(-C + k * value))`
    # If `value` is small positive, `k*value` is small positive. `-C + k*value` is large negative (if C is large). exp->0, score->1.
    # If `value` is large positive, `k*value` is large positive. `-C + k*value` is large positive. exp->inf, score->0.

    # This seems correct. We need to choose `C` and `k`.
    # `C` can be thought of as a threshold for how "loose" a fit is acceptable.
    # If we want to prioritize fits that are "just enough", `C` could be related to 0.
    # `k` determines the sensitivity to the difference.

    # Let's set `C = 0` and `k = steepness`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`
    # This is the function we analyzed that was decreasing.
    # It gives:
    #   - r < 0 => score > 0.5 (approaching 1)
    #   - r = 0 => score = 0.5
    #   - r > 0 => score < 0.5 (approaching 0)

    # This means it strongly prefers bins that CANNOT fit the item, which is WRONG.

    # The problem is applying sigmoid directly to remaining capacity.
    # A true Sigmoid Fit Score for Best Fit might involve fitting a sigmoid to
    # the points `(r, priority_for_r)`.

    # Let's simplify the objective: Among valid bins, we want the one with minimal `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # This is like finding the minimum.
    # We can use sigmoid to create a "soft" minimum.

    # A different approach: The sigmoid could represent the probability of selecting a bin.
    # We want higher probability for bins that are "tight".
    # Let's use `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (target_rem_cap - actual_rem_cap)))`
    # Where `target_rem_cap` is the ideal remaining capacity. Ideally 0.
    # `actual_rem_cap` is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.

    # Score = `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (0 - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))))`
    # Score = `1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`

    # This is the same decreasing function. The core issue is that negative remainders
    # are treated as "very good fits" by this function's structure.

    # How about creating a piecewise score?
    # For `r < 0`: score = 0
    # For `r >= 0`: score = `sigmoid(k * (MaxPossibleDiff - r))` where MaxPossibleDiff is some large value.
    # Or `sigmoid(k * (-r))`?
    # `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (-r))) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`. Still the decreasing function.

    # Let's use a sigmoid to rank the "goodness" of the remaining space.
    # The more remaining space `r`, the less desirable the bin might be for a tight packing strategy.
    # Consider mapping `r` to `score = sigmoid(gain - steepness * r)`
    # Let `gain` be some offset.
    # If we set `gain = 0`, we have `sigmoid(-steepness * r) = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))`.

    # What if the sigmoid is applied to the inverse of the remaining capacity?
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon))))`
    # For `r` near 0, `1/r` is large positive. `score` approaches 1.
    # For `r` large, `1/r` is near 0. `score` approaches 0.5.
    # This looks promising!

    # Let's define the priority:
    # For bins where `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`:
    # Let `value = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # We want high score for small `value`.
    # Consider `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (C - value)))` where `k > 0`.
    # To make it prefer small `value`, we need `k` and `C` to be tuned.
    # If `C = 0`, score is `1 / (1 + exp(k * value))`. This is decreasing.

    # Let's use a simpler sigmoid transformation for "best fit" behavior:
    # For bins where `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`, we want to score them based on how small `potential_remaining_cap` is.
    # This is equivalent to ranking them from smallest `potential_remaining_cap` to largest.

    # The Sigmoid Fit Score strategy aims to find a sweet spot in remaining capacity,
    # or to strongly favor tight fits.

    # Let's try prioritizing based on `1 - sigmoid(k * remaining_capacity)`.
    # If `remaining_capacity` is small positive, `k*r` is small positive, sigmoid is >0.5. `1-sigmoid` is <0.5. Bad.
    # If `remaining_capacity` is large positive, `k*r` is large positive, sigmoid is near 1. `1-sigmoid` is near 0. Good. This is favoring loose fits.

    # It seems the interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score" needs to be clear.
    # If it's about "how close to a perfect fit (remainder=0)", then `1/(1+exp(k*(r-0)))` is decreasing, so smallest `r` gives highest score.

    # Let's define the score more concretely:
    # The priority score for a bin `i` should be high if `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item` AND `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimized.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want a function `f(r)` such that:
    # f(r) = 0 for r < 0
    # f(r) is decreasing for r >= 0.

    # Let's try a sigmoid on `k * (large_value - r)`
    # Consider the score to be a transformed version of `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # We want small non-negative `potential_remaining_cap` to get high scores.
    # Let `score_raw = -potential_remaining_cap`. Higher `score_raw` is better.
    # Then apply sigmoid: `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * score_raw))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # Again, this favors negative `potential_remaining_cap` which means item doesn't fit.

    # Let's adjust the target. The goal is to have a small, but potentially non-zero, remaining capacity.
    # This can leave room for items of slightly different sizes, or perhaps encourage future fits.
    # However, for "Best Fit", we want remainder exactly 0.

    # Consider the objective: maximize `1 / (1 + exp(k * (r - C)))` for `r >= 0`.
    # This function is maximized when `r - C` is minimized (most negative).
    # If `C = 0`, then maximized when `r` is most negative.

    # Let's try mapping `potential_remaining_cap` to a priority.
    # The closer `potential_remaining_cap` is to `item`'s original size, the better. No, this is First Fit Decreasing.
    # The closer `potential_remaining_cap` is to 0, the better.

    # A reasonable "Sigmoid Fit Score" could be based on how well the item fills the bin relative to its remaining capacity.
    # For valid bins: `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`
    # Score based on `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to give high scores to bins with `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` close to 0.

    # Let's use `sigmoid(gain - k * difference)` where `difference = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-(gain - k * difference)))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * difference - gain))`

    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # If we want a "perfect fit" to be ideal, we want `difference = 0` to have the highest score.
    # `score(0) = 1 / (1 + exp(-gain))`
    # If `difference > 0`, `k*difference` is larger positive. `score` will be less than `score(0)`.
    # If `difference < 0` (item does not fit), we want score = 0.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * difference - gain))` needs to be 0 for `difference < 0`.
    # This means `k * difference - gain` should be very large positive for `difference < 0`.
    # Let's set `gain = k * target_difference`. If target is 0, `gain = 0`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * difference))`
    # This function is decreasing, but `difference < 0` gives higher scores than `difference = 0`.

    # The core issue is that sigmoid is monotonic. We need to apply it to a quantity that is ranked correctly.
    # The ranking we want is: (small `r` >= 0) > (large `r` >= 0) > ( `r` < 0)

    # Let's modify the sigmoid's input:
    # For valid bins, calculate `priorities[i] = sigmoid(-k * potential_remaining_cap[i])`
    # `sigmoid(-x) = 1 - sigmoid(x)`.
    # So `priorities[i] = 1 - sigmoid(k * potential_remaining_cap[i])`
    # `priorities[i] = 1 - 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap[i]))`
    # `priorities[i] = exp(k * potential_remaining_cap[i]) / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap[i]))`
    # This is also `sigmoid(-k * potential_remaining_cap[i])`.

    # Let `r = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # `sigmoid(-k * r)`:
    #   - If `r` is small positive (good fit), `-k*r` is small negative. sigmoid is < 0.5.
    #   - If `r` is large positive (bad fit), `-k*r` is large negative. sigmoid is close to 0.
    #   - If `r` is zero, `-k*r` is zero. sigmoid is 0.5.
    #   - If `r` is negative (cannot fit), `-k*r` is positive. sigmoid is > 0.5.

    # This still ranks negative remaining capacities as "better" than 0 remaining capacity.

    # The "Sigmoid Fit Score" could be a way to smooth the ranking.
    # Let's use a function that prioritizes minimum `potential_remaining_cap` among valid bins.
    # The score for a bin should be `f(potential_remaining_cap)`.
    # `f` should be decreasing for `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`.

    # A simple approach is to use a large sigmoid value for small `r`.
    # What if we map `potential_remaining_cap` to `r_mapped = C - k * potential_remaining_cap`?
    # Then apply sigmoid: `score = sigmoid(r_mapped)`.
    # For `potential_remaining_cap` close to 0, we want `r_mapped` to be large positive.
    # This implies `C` should be large, or `-k` should be large positive. So `k` is negative.
    # But we used `k>0` for steepness.

    # Let's invert the interpretation. Let's say `score = sigmoid(k * (C - potential_remaining_cap))`
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is small, `C - potential_remaining_cap` is large, sigmoid -> 1.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large, `C - potential_remaining_cap` is small, sigmoid -> low.
    # This seems correct for valid bins!

    # We need to handle invalid bins (score = 0).
    # And we need to choose `C` and `k`.
    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # A good choice for `C` would be something that represents a "neutral" point.
    # If `C=0`, then `score = sigmoid(k * (-potential_remaining_cap)) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # This is the decreasing function we already analyzed.

    # Let's adjust the scaling and shift.
    # The goal is that for `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`:
    # small values get scores close to 1.
    # large values get scores close to 0.

    # Let `y = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # Consider a function like `exp(-k * y)`. This is decreasing.
    # Let's scale and shift it within sigmoid:
    # `score = sigmoid(alpha + beta * y)` where `beta` is negative.
    # `score = sigmoid(alpha - beta_abs * y)` where `beta_abs > 0`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-(alpha - beta_abs * y)))`
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(beta_abs * y - alpha))`
    # This is `1 / (1 + exp(k * (y - alpha/k)))`.
    # So it's `1 / (1 + exp(k * (y - C)))`. Where `C = alpha/k`.

    # This means `1 / (1 + exp(k * (potential_remaining_cap - C)))` is a decreasing function.
    # It will give high scores for small `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # We need to set `C` and `k`.
    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # If `C` is the target "best fit" remaining capacity, which is 0.
    # Then `score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # This function gives:
    # r = 0 -> score = 0.5
    # r > 0 -> score < 0.5
    # r < 0 -> score > 0.5

    # So, to make it work, we must explicitly set scores to 0 for invalid bins.
    # For valid bins, the score `1 / (1 + exp(steepness * potential_remaining_cap))`
    # will rank bins with smaller `potential_remaining_cap` higher.

    # Let's implement this.
    # The "strength" of preference for tighter fits will be controlled by `steepness`.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

    # Find bins where the item can fit
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap - item

    # For bins that can fit the item, calculate the sigmoid priority score.
    # The function 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * remaining_capacity)) gives higher scores for smaller remaining_capacity.
    # A steepness of, say, 5.0 means the score will drop significantly as remaining capacity increases beyond a small value.

    # Calculate exponent argument. Use potential_remaining_cap for valid bins.
    exponent_args = steepness * potential_remaining_cap[can_fit_mask]

    # Clip exponent arguments to prevent overflow/underflow.
    # Values too large positive (e.g., > 700 for double precision exp) result in 0.
    # Values too large negative (e.g., < -700) result in 1.
    # A range of [-20, 20] for the argument of `exp` usually gives reasonable output.
    clipped_exponent_args = np.clip(exponent_args, -30, 30) # Slightly larger range for safety

    # Calculate the priority scores for valid bins.
    # Using the formulation that gives higher priority to smaller remaining capacity:
    # score = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))
    # Where r = potential_remaining_cap.
    # For r = 0, score = 0.5. For r > 0, score < 0.5. For r << 0, score >> 0.5.
    # This is NOT the desired behavior for "best fit".

    # Let's try the opposite sigmoid's input.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * r))`
    # This function `g(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*r))` is INCREASING in `r`.
    #   - r = 0 -> score = 0.5
    #   - r > 0 -> score > 0.5
    #   - r < 0 -> score < 0.5

    # This means it favors bins with *larger* remaining capacity. This is "Worst Fit".

    # The "Sigmoid Fit Score" strategy needs to assign higher scores to bins
    # where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small and non-negative.

    # Let's define the score based on the "tightness" of the fit.
    # Tightness: `1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)` for `potential_remaining_cap >= 0`.
    # This gives a large score for `r` near 0.
    # Then apply sigmoid to this mapped value.
    # Let `scaled_tightness = k * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon))`
    # Score = `sigmoid(scaled_tightness)` = `1 / (1 + exp(-scaled_tightness))`
    # Score = `1 / (1 + exp(-k / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)))`

    # Let's test this.
    # `r` is `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # If `r` is very small positive (e.g., 1e-5):
    #   `1.0 / (r + epsilon)` is large positive.
    #   `-k / (r + epsilon)` is large negative.
    #   `exp(...)` is close to 0.
    #   `score` is close to 1. (GOOD)
    # If `r` is large positive (e.g., 100):
    #   `1.0 / (r + epsilon)` is close to 0.
    #   `-k / (r + epsilon)` is close to 0.
    #   `exp(...)` is close to 1.
    #   `score` is close to 0.5. (OK, but we want lower score for larger `r`).

    # This seems to prioritize smaller remaining capacities well.
    # We need to ensure `epsilon` is small enough and chosen wisely.

    # Let's refine: `steepness` controls the slope.
    # `priorities = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)))`

    # Handling invalid bins:
    # For `can_fit_mask[i] == False`, priority is 0.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to prevent division by zero

    # Calculate remaining capacity only for bins where item can fit
    valid_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    potential_remaining_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins_mask] - item

    # For valid bins, calculate a measure of "tightness"
    # `tightness_measure = 1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)`
    # This value is large when `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is small.

    # Apply sigmoid to a scaled version of this tightness measure.
    # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` increases with `x`.
    # We want score to increase with tightness.
    # Let `x = steepness * tightness_measure`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-steepness * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon))))`

    # Let's test `steepness = 5.0`.
    # `r = 0.01` (small positive remaining capacity)
    #   `tightness = 1.0 / (0.01 + 1e-9) approx 100`
    #   `x = 5.0 * 100 = 500`
    #   `exp(-500)` is very close to 0.
    #   `score = 1 / (1 + 0) = 1`. (Excellent score)

    # `r = 10.0` (larger remaining capacity)
    #   `tightness = 1.0 / (10.0 + 1e-9) approx 0.1`
    #   `x = 5.0 * 0.1 = 0.5`
    #   `exp(-0.5) approx 0.606`
    #   `score = 1 / (1 + 0.606) approx 0.623`. (Decent score, lower than 1)

    # `r = 0.0` (perfect fit)
    #   `tightness = 1.0 / (0.0 + 1e-9) = 1e9` (very large)
    #   `x = 5.0 * 1e9` (very large)
    #   `exp(-x)` is extremely close to 0.
    #   `score = 1`.

    # This formulation seems robust for prioritizing bins with the smallest non-negative remaining capacity.
    # `steepness` controls how aggressively we penalize larger remaining capacities.

    # Handle potential overflow in `exp` if `steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)` is very large negative.
    # This happens if `potential_remaining_cap` is large positive.
    # If `steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)` becomes very small negative, exp is ~1, score is 0.5.
    # If it becomes very large negative, exp is ~0, score is 1. This is the issue.

    # Let's ensure the argument to `exp` is within a safe range.
    # The argument is `-steepness / (potential_remaining_cap + epsilon)`.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is small positive, the argument is large negative.
    # If `potential_remaining_cap` is large positive, the argument is small negative.

    # Let `arg = -steepness / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)`
    # If `arg` is very negative (e.g., < -30), `exp(arg)` -> 0, score -> 1.
    # If `arg` is very positive (e.g., > 30), `exp(arg)` -> inf, score -> 0.

    # We want scores to be high for small `potential_remaining_cap`.
    # This means `arg` should be large negative. This gives score near 1.
    # For larger `potential_remaining_cap`, `arg` becomes less negative or even positive.
    # If `arg` is close to 0, score is 0.5.
    # If `arg` is positive, score is < 0.5.

    # So, `score = 1 / (1 + exp(arg))` where `arg = -steepness * (1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon))`.
    # Let's clip `arg` to avoid overflow/underflow for `exp`.
    # We want to avoid `arg` becoming extremely large negative or extremely large positive.
    # `arg` can be very large negative if `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is close to 0.
    # `arg` is close to 0 if `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is very large.

    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is close to zero, `1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)` is large.
    # Then `arg` is large negative. `exp(arg)` is near 0. `score` is near 1. (Good)
    # If `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is very large, `1.0 / (potential_remaining_cap_valid + epsilon)` is close to zero.
    # Then `arg` is close to 0. `exp(arg)` is near 1. `score` is near 0.5. (This means larger remaining capacity gets score 0.5, which is not strictly worse than optimal 0.5 for perfect fit).

    # To make larger remaining capacities get lower scores, we might need to modify this.
    # Perhaps `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * potential_remaining_cap))` but inverted or shifted.

    # Let's use the previous formulation that seemed to work:
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (C - value)))`
    # where `value = potential_remaining_cap`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * value - C))`

    # We want higher scores for smaller `value`.
    # This function is decreasing if `k > 0`.

    # Let `k = steepness`.
    # We need `C` to position the sigmoid.
    # If we set `C` to a value that makes `k * C` equal to the "median" difference, or related to typical differences.

    # Let's try to use `sigmoid(k * (max_diff - r))` where `max_diff` is a large constant or max possible diff.
    # If `r=0`, `sigmoid(k*max_diff)` -> 1.
    # If `r=max_diff`, `sigmoid(0)` -> 0.5.
    # If `r > max_diff`, `sigmoid(-ve)` -> <0.5.

    # The function should prioritize smallest `r >= 0`.
    # Let `f(r)` be the priority score for `r`.
    # `f(0)` highest, `f(large_r)` lower.

    # Let's consider the function `1 / (1 + exp(-k * r))` but on a transformed `r`.
    # If we transform `r` such that it's large positive when `r` is small, and small negative when `r` is large.
    # This is what `1.0 / (r + epsilon)` does, but the range might not be ideal for sigmoid.

    # Let's cap `potential_remaining_cap` for the "good" range.
    # Say, anything greater than `item * 2` is considered "very loose".

    # Let's retry the formulation that promotes small positive remainders.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (r - C)))` where `k>0`.
    # This is a decreasing function. To get high scores for small `r`, we need `r-C` to be small (most negative).
    # This means `C` should be the target value, and if `r` is below `C`, score is high.
    # The ideal target is `r = 0`. So `C = 0`.
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`.

    # Re-evaluation of `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` for `r = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # `k > 0`.
    # `r < 0` (invalid fit): `k*r` is negative. `exp(k*r)` is < 1. `1 / (1 + exp)` is > 0.5. (high priority)
    # `r = 0` (perfect fit): `k*r` is 0. `exp(0) = 1`. `1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5`. (medium priority)
    # `r > 0` (loose fit): `k*r` is positive. `exp(k*r)` is > 1. `1 / (1 + exp)` is < 0.5. (low priority)

    # This function, `1 / (1 + exp(k * r))`, strongly prefers bins that CANNOT fit the item.
    # This is the opposite of "Best Fit".

    # We need a score that increases as `r` decreases for `r >= 0`.
    # And is 0 for `r < 0`.

    # Let's define a transformation:
    # `transformed_r = -r` for `r >= 0`
    # `transformed_r = very_small_number` for `r < 0`
    # Then apply `sigmoid(k * transformed_r)`.

    # `transformed_r` for valid bins: `-potential_remaining_cap_valid`
    # For invalid bins, `potential_remaining_cap_valid` is not applicable.
    # For valid bins `r >= 0`: We want `f(r)` to be decreasing.
    # `f(r) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * r))` works.
    # BUT we need to ensure that bins where `r < 0` get score 0.

    # Let's combine:
    # For `i` where `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`: `priorities[i] = 0.0`
    # For `i` where `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:
    #   `r = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`
    #   `priorities[i] = 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * r))`

    # This seems to be the most sensible application of the sigmoid to achieve "Best Fit" ranking.
    # `steepness` controls how sharply the priority drops as remaining capacity increases.
    # A higher `steepness` means a stronger preference for tight fits.

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    steepness = 5.0  # Tunable parameter for sigmoid steepness

    # Identify bins where the item can fit
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # Calculate remaining capacity for these valid bins
    potential_remaining_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # Calculate the sigmoid score for valid bins.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` decreases as `x` increases.
    # We want higher scores for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # So, we use `x = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # This means the scores are higher for smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.

    exponent_args = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid

    # Clip arguments to exp to prevent overflow/underflow.
    # If `exponent_args` is large positive (>30), exp -> inf, score -> 0.
    # If `exponent_args` is large negative (<-30), exp -> 0, score -> 1.
    clipped_exponent_args = np.clip(exponent_args, -30.0, 30.0)

    # Calculate the priority scores for valid bins.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(clipped_exponent_args))

    return priorities

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize tight fits. Smooth rankings with sigmoid, penalizing large remaining capacity.
Prioritize exact fits. Then, prioritize minimum remaining capacity.
Prioritize tighter fits. Use sigmoid for smooth, normalized scoring.
Prioritize by minimizing remaining capacity for "best fit."
Prioritize bins that minimize wasted space for a tighter fit.
Prioritize minimal waste. Penalize large surplus capacities.
Prioritize bins with minimal surplus. Use softmax for smooth preference transitions.
Prioritize minimizing waste, preferring bins with just enough space.
Prioritize based on how well the item fits, not just eligibility.
Prioritize exact fits. For others, favor bins with least remaining capacity after packing.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Focus on "best fit" strategies: prioritize exact matches, then bins minimizing remaining capacity. Employ sigmoid or softmax for smooth preference curves, penalizing large unused space to improve bin utilization.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect or near-perfect fit).
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    steepness = 5.0  # Tunable parameter: higher values mean stronger preference for tight fits.

    # Identify bins where the item can fit.
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # Calculate the remaining capacity for bins that can fit the item.
    # If a bin can fit, the remaining capacity after packing is: bins_remain_cap[i] - item
    potential_remaining_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # Calculate the exponent argument for the sigmoid function.
    # We want to prioritize smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is decreasing in `x`.
    # To make it decrease as `potential_remaining_cap_valid` increases, we set `x = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid`.
    # A small `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (tight fit) results in a smaller `x`, thus a higher score.
    # A large `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (loose fit) results in a larger `x`, thus a lower score.
    exponent_args = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid

    # Clip the exponent arguments to prevent potential overflow/underflow in np.exp.
    # Values like +/- 700 can cause issues. A range like [-30, 30] is generally safe.
    # For very negative args, exp -> 0, score -> 1. For very positive args, exp -> inf, score -> 0.
    clipped_exponent_args = np.clip(exponent_args, -30.0, 30.0)

    # Calculate the priority scores for the valid bins using the sigmoid function.
    # priorities[can_fit_mask] will be populated with scores between ~0.5 (for perfect fit) and ~0 (for very loose fits).
    # Scores for bins that cannot fit remain 0.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(clipped_exponent_args))

    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a tuned Sigmoid Best Fit.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function with a tunable steepness and an offset. The offset
    introduces a preference for already "good" fits to be even more prioritized,
    especially when considering the proportion of item size to bin capacity.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item - offset))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item - offset).
    A smaller (remaining_capacity - item - offset) leads to a higher score.
    The offset is designed to slightly favor tighter fits that are still relatively generous,
    preventing extremely tight fits from dominating to the exclusion of all else.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (ideal fit).
