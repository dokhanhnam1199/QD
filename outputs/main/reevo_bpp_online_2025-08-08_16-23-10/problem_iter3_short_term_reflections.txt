Prioritize tight fits. Smooth rankings with sigmoid, penalizing large remaining capacity.
Prioritize exact fits. Then, prioritize minimum remaining capacity.
Prioritize tighter fits. Use sigmoid for smooth, normalized scoring.
Prioritize by minimizing remaining capacity for "best fit."
Prioritize bins that minimize wasted space for a tighter fit.
Prioritize minimal waste. Penalize large surplus capacities.
Prioritize bins with minimal surplus. Use softmax for smooth preference transitions.
Prioritize minimizing waste, preferring bins with just enough space.
Prioritize based on how well the item fits, not just eligibility.
Prioritize exact fits. For others, favor bins with least remaining capacity after packing.
