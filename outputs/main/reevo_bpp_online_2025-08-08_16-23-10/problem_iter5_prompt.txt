BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nPrioritize bins with minimal *post-placement* remaining capacity. Use smoothed, non-linear functions (like sigmoid/softmax on negative surplus) for tunable preference, favoring tighter fits and improved bin utilization.\n\n[Code]\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit.\n\n    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest\n    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated\n    using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.\n\n    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score\n    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).\n    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),\n    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect or near-perfect fit).\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    steepness = 5.0  # Tunable parameter: higher values mean stronger preference for tight fits.\n\n    # Identify bins where the item can fit.\n    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity for bins that can fit the item.\n    # If a bin can fit, the remaining capacity after packing is: bins_remain_cap[i] - item\n    potential_remaining_cap_valid = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item\n\n    # Calculate the exponent argument for the sigmoid function.\n    # We want to prioritize smaller `potential_remaining_cap_valid`.\n    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` is decreasing in `x`.\n    # To make it decrease as `potential_remaining_cap_valid` increases, we set `x = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid`.\n    # A small `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (tight fit) results in a smaller `x`, thus a higher score.\n    # A large `potential_remaining_cap_valid` (loose fit) results in a larger `x`, thus a lower score.\n    exponent_args = steepness * potential_remaining_cap_valid\n\n    # Clip the exponent arguments to prevent potential overflow/underflow in np.exp.\n    # Values like +/- 700 can cause issues.
