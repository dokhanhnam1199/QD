```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Random Fit.

    In Random Fit, we randomly select a bin that has enough capacity for the item.
    This priority function assigns a higher priority to bins that have enough capacity
    for the item, effectively making it more likely for those bins to be chosen.
    A truly random selection among valid bins would be handled by the selection
    mechanism outside this function. This function aims to 'filter' bins that
    cannot fit the item.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Assign a high priority (e.g., 1) to bins that can accommodate the item,
    # and a low priority (e.g., 0) to bins that cannot.
    # This allows the selection logic to pick from valid bins.
    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1, 0)
    return priorities
