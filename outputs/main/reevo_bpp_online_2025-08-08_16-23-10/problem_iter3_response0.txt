[Prior reflection]
Focus on "best fit" strategies: prioritize exact matches, then bins minimizing remaining capacity. Employ sigmoid or softmax for smooth preference curves, penalizing large unused space to improve bin utilization.

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Sigmoid Best Fit.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item and have the smallest
    remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy). The priority is calculated
    using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking, strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit. For bins that can fit, the score
    is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Scores range from 0 (cannot fit or very loose fit) to 1 (perfect or near-perfect fit).

Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a refined
    Sigmoid Best Fit strategy, prioritizing exact matches.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item. It gives the highest
    priority to bins that perfectly fit the item. For other bins that can fit, it
    prioritizes those with the smallest remaining capacity after packing (Best Fit strategy).
    The priority is calculated using a sigmoid function to provide a smooth ranking,
    strongly favoring tighter fits.

    The score for a bin is 0 if the item cannot fit.
    For bins that can fit:
    - If the remaining capacity is exactly the item size (perfect fit), the score is 1.0.
    - Otherwise, the score is calculated as 1 / (1 + exp(steepness * (remaining_capacity - item))).
    This function is monotonically decreasing with respect to (remaining_capacity - item),
    meaning smaller non-negative remaining capacities get higher scores.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
