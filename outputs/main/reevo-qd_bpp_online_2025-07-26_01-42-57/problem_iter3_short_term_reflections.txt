Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize larger unused capacities, and slightly devalue newer bins for balanced utilization.
Focus on packing efficiency; avoid unnecessary penalties and prioritize available space flexibly.
Focus on clear bin capacity checks, penalize infeasible options heavily, and use logistic transformations to balance preference.
Use penalties for large gaps, prioritize exact fits, and consider specific item characteristics.
Focus on item fit and minimal capacity usage; penalize fullness, not history.
Focus on penalizing infeasible bins strongly and utilizing sigmoid functions for smoother priority adjustments.
Prioritize bins with least gaps, penalize infeasible choices, and boost second-smallest spaces to minimize fragmentation and maximize bin usage.
Focus on minimizing gaps and ensuring feasibility; prioritize bins nearly fitting item.
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize larger unused capacities, and slightly devalue newer bins for balanced utilization.
Focus on clear bin capacity checks, penalize infeasible options heavily, and use logistic transformations to balance filling priorities effectively.
