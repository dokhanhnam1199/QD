```python
def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation focuses on prioritizing exact fits, penalizing large gaps,
    and considering item characteristics to efficiently manage bin space.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin, where capacity is the
                       difference between bin size and the current total size of items inside the bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Higher score means higher priority to place the item in the bin.
