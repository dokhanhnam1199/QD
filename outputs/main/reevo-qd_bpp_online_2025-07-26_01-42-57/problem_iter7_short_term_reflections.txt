Prioritize bins with minimal capacity gaps and ensure feasibility first; incorporate compactness and avoid penalties on partial fits.
Use feasible bins only, adjust penalty scaling, and avoid unnecessary manipulations.
Prioritize bins with minimal size gaps and sufficient capacity using smooth penalties.
Prioritize bins with minimal size gaps and sufficient capacity using smooth penalties.
Focus on exact fits, use logistic penalties for gaps, and discard infeasible bins.
Prioritize bins with minimal capacity difference, use smooth decay, ensure normalization.
Prioritize bins with minimal size difference to item, balancing capacity utilization and compactness.
Focus on exact fits, penalize gaps with logistic, prioritize feasibility and smaller unused capacities.
Combine feasibility checks with sigmoid penalties to balance fit and gap minimization.
