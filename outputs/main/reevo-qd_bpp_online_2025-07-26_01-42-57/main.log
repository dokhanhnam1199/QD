System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

Refer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `priority_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

[2025-07-26 01:44:57,045][root][INFO] - Short-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Use a max function to avoid negative priorities and ensure feasibility
    priority = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item) / item
    
    # Give a clear preference to bins that can fit the item at all
    can_fit_item_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priority[np.where(~can_fit_item_mask)] -= 2
    
    # Encourage the second smallest gaps (fill bigger empty spots尽早 to encourage less fragmentation)
    # Less penalty for bins pediatric returning subtle fragments after an insertion
    if np.any(can_fit_item_mask):
        priority_after_check = bins_remain_cap - item
        highest_remaining_capacities = np.partition(priority_after_check[can_fit_item_mask], 1)[:2]
        low = highest_remaining_capacities[0] if len(highest_remaining_capacities) > 1 else 0
        low_idx = np.where(np.isclose(priority_after_check, low))[0]
        if len(low_idx) == 1:
            priority[low_idx[0]] += 1  # boost solitare other fragment accent withok followers much step-water pour toplantı
    
    return priority

[Better code]

    """
    # Find bins that can accommodate the item
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # Create a score array, start with high scores for non-possible bins
    scores = np.where(possible_bins, bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    
    # Penalize bins with more remaining capacity than item size to prioritize use of slightly-filled bins
    scores = np.where(possible_bins, scores - (bins_remain_cap - item), scores)
    
    # Consider the number of bins as well, encouraging filling decentral binceng bins rather than just filling
    # already pretty full ones
    # Count starts from 1 to avoid division by zero (each bin implicitly has an ID as per its original index in func arg)
    scores = scores - 0.01 * np.arange(1, len(bins_remain_cap) + 1)[possible_bins]
    
    return scores

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Worse code]
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Use a max function to avoid negative priorities and ensure feasibility
    priority = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item) / item
    
    # Give a clear preference to bins that can fit the item at all
    can_fit_item_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priority[np.where(~can_fit_item_mask)] -= 2
    
    # Encourage the second smallest gaps (fill bigger empty spots尽早 to encourage less fragmentation)
    # Less penalty for bins pediatric returning subtle fragments after an insertion
    if np.any(can_fit_item_mask):
        priority_after_check = bins_remain_cap - item
        highest_remaining_capacities = np.partition(priority_after_check[can_fit_item_mask], 1)[:2]
        low = highest_remaining_capacities[0] if len(highest_remaining_capacities) > 1 else 0
        low_idx = np.where(np.isclose(priority_after_check, low))[0]

            priority[low_idx[0]] += 1  # boost solitare other fragment accent withok followers much step-water pour toplantı
    
    return priority

    # Consider the number of bins as well, encouraging filling decentral binceng bins rather than just filling

    scores = scores - 0.01 * np.arange(1, len(bins_remain_cap) + 1)[possible_bins]
    
    return scores

[Reflection]
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize larger unused capacities, and slightly devalue newer bins for balanced utilization.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize larger unused capacities, and slightly devalue newer bins for balanced utilization.
Focus on packing efficiency; avoid unnecessary penalties and prioritize available space flexibly.
Focus on clear bin capacity checks, penalize infeasible options heavily, and use logistic transformations to balance preference.
Use penalties for large gaps, prioritize exact fits, and consider specific item characteristics.
Focus on item fit and minimal capacity usage; penalize fullness, not history.
Focus on penalizing infeasible bins strongly and utilizing sigmoid functions for smoother priority adjustments.
Prioritize bins with least gaps, penalize infeasible choices, and boost second-smallest spaces to minimize fragmentation and maximize bin usage.
Focus on minimizing gaps and ensuring feasibility; prioritize bins nearly fitting item.
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize larger unused capacities, and slightly devalue newer bins for balanced utilization.
Focus on clear bin capacity checks, penalize infeasible options heavily, and use logistic transformations to balance filling priorities effectively.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Prioritize bins with minimal gaps, penalize infeasible and larger unused capacities, use logistic and sigmoid functions for flexible balancing, and avoid unnecessary penalties for balanced utilization.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of times a bin has available space for the item.
    We aim to fill bins that are closest in size to the item, promoting a compact packing.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate absolute difference between item size and remaining capacity in each bin
    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
    # Priority is high if the difference is low and the bin has enough capacity
    priority_scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 / (1 + diff), 0)
    return priority_scores

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
