Use logistic functions for feasibility and penalties, prioritize minimal gaps, avoid strong static penalties.
Focus on exact fits, penalize gaps, and prioritize efficient use of space.

Use logistic functions for feasibility and penalties, prioritize minimal gaps, avoid strong static penalties.
Prioritize fit feasibility, minimize capacity usage post-fit; penalize bins that fill nearly.
Minimize gaps and penalize non-fit bins strongly. Use soft constraints with sigmoid for smooth transitions.
Prioritize bins with minimal capacity difference to item size if they can fit it, enhancing compact packing efficiently.
Minimize gaps, penalize large capacities, ensure feasibility; focus on efficient logistic use.
