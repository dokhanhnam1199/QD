Prioritize perfect fits. Penalize near-full and non-fitting bins heavily. Waste minimization is key.

Prioritize minimal waste and bin fullness more directly. Penalize infeasibility strongly.

The better code prioritizes fill ratio and perfect fits, while the worse code relies on multiple hardcoded rules.

The better code uses a combination of fitting, wasted space, and fragmentation to improve bin packing.

The better code uses fill ratio, targeting near-full bins and rewarding perfect fits, while the worse code simply minimizes waste.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize excessive waste, and strongly discourage infeasible placements.

Prioritize fill ratio, aiming for near-full bins but rewarding exact fits, penalizing infeasibility more harshly.

Combining multiple, weighted criteria (capacity, utilization) and feasibility checks improves heuristic performance.

Prioritize minimal waste and fullness when item fits; otherwise, use remaining capacity. Avoid large negative penalties.

The better code directly optimizes for best fit, avoids slivers, and explicitly handles infeasibility with negative infinity.
