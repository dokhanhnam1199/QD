The better code uses targeted bin filling (around 95%), perfect fit preference, and empty bin penalization.

Prioritize near-full bins, rewarding good fits while penalizing excessive waste and infeasible placements.

Prioritize near-full bins, reward substantial fills, penalize near-overflows, and disallow infeasible placements.

Prioritize near-full bins (but avoid perfect fits) and disallow infeasible placements.

The better code uses a continuous priority function focused on high fill ratios, avoids near-empty bins, and rewards perfect fits.

Prioritize feasible bins. Reward near-full and perfect fits to improve bin utilization.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Directly use fill ratio, penalize near overflows, and avoid Gaussian distributions.

Prioritize near-full bins, rewarding good fits and penalizing near-overflow. Consider perfect fits and half-full bins.

Reward near-full bins and perfect fits directly. Avoid penalties; focus on positive incentives.

Directly rewarding near-full and perfect fits, penalizing overflow, and avoiding Gaussian distributions improves performance.
