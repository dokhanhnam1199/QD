Prioritize near-full bins using ratios instead of absolute remaining capacity and heavily reward perfect fits.

The better code prioritizes feasible solutions, perfect/near-perfect fits, and higher utilization while penalizing waste.

The better code prioritizes high fill ratios (but not too high) and penalizes infeasibility effectively.

Exploiting bin fullness (but not complete fullness) and infeasibility awareness improves online bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize feasible bins. Reward high utilization, perfect/near-perfect fits, and penalize wasted space.

Prioritize near-full bins, but avoid perfect fits unless unavoidable. Penalize near-overflowing bins.

Focus on fill ratio, target high but not perfect fill, and dynamically adjust priorities based on fill levels.

Prioritize near-full bins (but not perfect fits), penalize almost full, and reward filling more than half.

The better code prioritizes feasible fits, perfect/near-perfect fits, and utilization while penalizing waste.

Prioritize near-full and perfect fits. Penalize infeasible placements. Avoid direct ratios, use targeted rewards.
