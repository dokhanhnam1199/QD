Consider bin utilization, prioritize near-full bins, and penalize infeasible placements.

Prioritize bins with high fill ratios, especially near-perfect fits, while penalizing almost-full bins.

Prioritize near-full bins, but avoid perfect fits and very small waste. Consider bin capacity when assigning priorities.

The better code prioritizes high fill ratios (close to 0.95), avoiding both under- and over-filling, and penalizes infeasibility.

Prioritize fill ratio aiming for near-full bins (e.g., 95%) and heavily reward perfect fits. Penalize infeasibility.

Prioritize feasible fits, reward high utilization, penalize waste, and strongly favor near-perfect fits.

Prioritize fill ratio, targeting near-full bins. Avoid excessive penalties and explicitly reward perfect fits.

Prioritize near-full bins; avoid overfilling. The ratio of item size to remaining capacity is key.

Prioritize feasible fits, reward high utilization, and strongly penalize waste and infeasibility using thresholds.

The better code prioritizes feasible fits, rewards near-perfect fits, and balances utilization with waste.
