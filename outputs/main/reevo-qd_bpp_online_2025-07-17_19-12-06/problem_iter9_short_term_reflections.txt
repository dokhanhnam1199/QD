Prioritize high fill ratios, target near-full bins (e.g., 95%), and penalize near-perfect fits to reduce waste.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, rewards good fits, and balances utilization with waste reduction, unlike the ratio-based approach.

Focus on fill ratio targets (e.g., 95%), penalize near-full bins mildly, and heavily reward perfect fits.

Focus on fill ratio, prioritize near-full bins, and strongly penalize infeasible placements for better BPP heuristics.

Prioritize near-full bins but allow flexibility. Avoid perfect fits, as they might be useful for later items.

Focus on fill ratio, target near-full bins (but not perfectly), and slightly penalize near-overflow to minimize waste.

The better code uses thresholds, scaled fill ratios, and penalties/rewards for fit quality, which improve bin selection.

Prioritize high fill ratios, penalize near-overflow, and strongly reward perfect fits. The better code uses a continuous priority function.

Prioritize near-full and perfect fits. Penalize infeasible placements. Ratios alone are insufficient.

The better code uses a continuous priority function centered around high fill ratios, penalizing excessive emptiness.
