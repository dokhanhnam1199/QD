Sparsification per node and normalized inputs with adjusted weights improve heuristic performance.

Normalizing inputs and sparsifying rows independently improves heuristic quality for TSP.

Neighborhood density, implicit hub avoidance, sparsification, and normalization improve heuristic performance.

Consider more problem-specific information like average distance and dynamic sparsification thresholds.

Focus on relative ranking, centrality, adaptive sparsification, and row-wise normalization for improved heuristics.

Prioritize nearest neighbors/MST; sparsify by keeping top-k edges; normalize heuristics for balanced exploration.

Focus on neighborhood density, implicit hub avoidance, adaptive weighting, and normalization for robust sampling.

Centrality, adaptive sparsification, and geometric means often improve TSP heuristic performance.

Consider local density, normalization, and adaptive sparsification for robust TSP heuristics.

The better code uses neighborhood density, implicit hub avoidance, normalization, and sparsification for improved performance.
