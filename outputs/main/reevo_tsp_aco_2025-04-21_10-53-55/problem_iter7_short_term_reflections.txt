Focus on informative features, normalization, and careful sparsification to avoid zero rows/columns.

Relative ranking, centrality, and adaptive sparsification improve TSP heuristic performance. Normalization is crucial.

Robust normalization, averaging centrality, handling edge cases (empty quantile), and avoiding over-penalization improve heuristics.

Consider nearest neighbors, local density, geometric means, and row-wise normalization for enhanced performance and robustness.

Normalization, geometric mean, and handling sparsification edge cases improves heuristic robustness and performance.

Consider neighborhood density, dynamic hub penalties, and heuristic normalization for robust performance and exploration.

Geometric mean, adaptive sparsification, and row-wise normalization improve heuristic robustness and performance.

Better version: Geometric mean for centrality, sparsification, degree centrality refinement.

Consider node ranking, centrality, adaptive sparsification, and row-wise normalization for robust heuristic design.

Geometric mean, rank-based information, adaptive sparsification, and row-wise normalization improve heuristic quality and robustness.
