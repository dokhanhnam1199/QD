Consider neighborhood density, avoid hub nodes implicitly, and normalize heuristics for robust sampling.

Prioritize inverse distance, nearest neighbors, and sparsification. Use multiplicative combinations and tune weights empirically.

Focus on nearest neighbors, adaptive sparsification, and balanced combination of factors.

Prioritize inverse distance, nearest neighbors, MST approximation, and enforce symmetry. Avoid unnecessary penalties.

Consider node centrality using normalized row/column sums and geometric means for combination. Refine sparsification strategies.

Sparsify per-node, prioritize local node degree desirability, and penalize above-average distances for improvements.

Prioritize nearest neighbors and MST approximation. Normalize heuristics after combination.

Consider local neighborhood density, tune combination weights, and be cautious about normalization side effects.

Savings heuristic, node degree desirability, and weighted combinations improved the solution. Sparsification via quantile helps too.

Consider nearest neighbors, adaptive weighting, and more informed sparsification for better heuristics.
