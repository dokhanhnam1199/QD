Normalization, geometric mean centrality, and degree centrality refinement improve heuristic quality in TSP solvers.

Consider node ranking, neighbor relationships, and adaptive sparsification with higher thresholds for improved heuristics.

Prioritize degree centrality over geometric mean. Remove unnecessary edge length penalties and add column-wise normalization.

Normalization, centrality measures, and degree refinement improve heuristic quality. Sparsification prunes unpromising edges.

Normalization, centrality, rank information, sparsification, and degree centrality refinement are key.

Prioritize node ranking/centrality, normalize properly, and adjust sparsification adaptively for connectivity.

Normalization, centrality measures, rank information, and adaptive sparsification are key. Row-wise processing is beneficial.

Prioritize degree centrality. Remove unnecessary edge length penalties. Add column-wise normalization to avoid biases.

Prioritize simpler combinations, direct normalization, and avoid geometric means and square roots of ranks.

Prioritize centrality, penalize long edges, and reduce sparsification to maintain connectivity.
