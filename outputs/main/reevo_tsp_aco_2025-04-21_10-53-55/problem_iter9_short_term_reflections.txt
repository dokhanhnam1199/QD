Geometric mean centrality, rank-based information, and careful normalization improve TSP heuristic performance.

Normalize inputs, stabilize ranks, use geometric means, and adjust sparsification for balanced exploration.

Geometric mean centrality, simple averaging, and rank-based information improved heuristic quality.

Consider degree centrality, and normalize both rows and columns after sparsification for better edge selection.

Geometric mean centrality, adjusted sparsification, and connectivity maintenance improve heuristic quality.

Better heuristics use normalization, local density, geometric means, adaptive sparsification, and row-wise processing.

Normalization, rank information, and geometric mean centrality significantly improve heuristic quality. Sparsification helps.

Geometric mean centrality, adaptive sparsification, and degree centrality refinement yield better heuristics. Normalization is crucial.

The better code uses rank, geometric mean centrality, and normalization more effectively than the worse code.

Better heuristics: use rank-based measures, geometric means, adaptive sparsification, and row-wise normalization.
