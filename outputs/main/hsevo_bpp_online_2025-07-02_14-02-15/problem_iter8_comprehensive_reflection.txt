Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to make it more actionable for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, empirical tuning, dynamic adaptation, balanced factors.
*   **Advice:** Start simple, measure impact of added complexity, adjust based on problem state, and focus on performance metrics.
*   **Avoid:** Unjustified complexity, pre-mature stochasticity, and complex non-linear functions without clear justification.
*   **Explanation:** Build heuristics incrementally, focusing on demonstrable performance gains at each step. Prioritize clear, tunable parameters, and adaptive responses to problem characteristics.
