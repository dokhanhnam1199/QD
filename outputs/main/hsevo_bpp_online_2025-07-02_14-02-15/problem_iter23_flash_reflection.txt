**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st has a much more complex and adaptive system for exploration, fragmentation penalty, and sweet spot incentive, including parameter tuning and bin history, while the 20th uses simpler, static calculations.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see 2nd has the bin history, while 19th focuses on the core components, best-fit, adaptive exploration, and a dynamic sweet spot.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the difference is the presence of explicit default argument values and imports of unnecessary libraries like `math`, `scipy`, and `torch` in the 2nd, which do not affect the logic.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that the 3rd uses dynamic sweet spot incentive ranges and includes a reward for larger bins based on item size while the 4th uses a fixed sweet spot range and rewards small items in large bins. The 4th also attempts bin history but may fail because bin_usage_history may not exist.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the 19th incorporates a dynamic sweet spot and item-dependent exploration, while the 20th has a simpler exploration factor and sweet spot calculation. Overall: The better heuristics are characterized by more sophisticated adaptive strategies, parameter tuning, and consideration of bin history (when available), whereas the poorer ones rely on simplified static calculations and lack item-specific adjustments.

**Experience:**
Prioritize adaptive strategies with tunable parameters based on item properties and bin states. Include bin history for better context awareness. Balance complexity with clear logic to avoid over-engineering, and remember to handle potential errors gracefully.
