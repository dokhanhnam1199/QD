Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, steering clear of the pitfalls outlined in "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a breakdown to guide improvements:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, iterative, empirical, balance, problem-aware.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple, demonstrably effective heuristic core. Incrementally add complexity only when justified by empirical results. Prioritize problem-aware adaptations over excessive parameters.

*   **Avoid:** Over-engineering, non-linear complexity without justification, fixed stochasticity, and premature optimization. Avoid adding features without understanding their isolated effects.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on *why* an adaptation helps, not just *that* it does. Small, problem-aware adjustments are better than large, untuned ones. Build incrementally, validating each addition.
