{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nComplex heuristics with adaptive components, such as item-aware penalties and dynamic sweet spots, generally perform better. A good balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial. Start with a solid best-fit core and then add adaptive elements incrementally, tuning parameters carefully. Don't forget to keep it simple with demonstratable impact, validated empirically.\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a simple, effective base and iteratively add complexities like fragmentation penalties, stochastic exploration, and incentives for specific scenarios (e.g., large items, nearly full bins). Carefully tune the weights and thresholds of these components based on empirical testing.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors such as best-fit, fragmentation, and bin utilization. Adapt parameters dynamically based on the state of the problem. Experiment with different weighting schemes to balance exploration and exploitation.\n\nFavor item-aware heuristics. Adaptive stochasticity is better than fixed. Dynamic fragmentation penalties that consider item size are helpful. A sweet-spot incentive can improve performance. Start with simple adaptive components before introducing excessive customization through parameters.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nCombining multiple factors with non-linear functions, incorporating stochasticity for exploration, penalizing fragmentation, and using array operations are key to designing effective heuristics. Also, considering relative waste to the item size instead of absolute waste is important.\n\nPrioritize adaptive heuristics that adjust parameters based on problem characteristics. Favor dynamic adjustments to exploration, fragmentation penalties, and reward thresholds. Carefully tune the strength of different components to achieve a balance between exploration, exploitation, and problem-specific considerations like fragmentation and bin utilization.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize adaptability and fine-grained control by including numerous tunable parameters, dynamically adjusting strategies based on input characteristics (e.g., item size, bin capacity), and incorporating historical data (e.g., bin usage) to make informed decisions.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
