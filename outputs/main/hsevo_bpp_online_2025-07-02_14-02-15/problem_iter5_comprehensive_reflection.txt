Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective in guiding heuristic design.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Incremental improvement, base heuristic, parameter tuning, empirical validation.
*   **Advice:** Begin with a solid, easily understood core heuristic. Introduce enhancements (e.g., fragmentation handling, specialized rules) one at a time. Meticulously adjust parameters using thorough testing.
*   **Avoid:** Unnecessary complexity from the outset, premature optimization, reliance on intuition without data.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on controlled experimentation and data-driven adjustments. Add complexity gradually, verifying each addition's benefit through rigorous empirical validation. This prevents over-engineering and ensures each component contributes meaningfully.
