Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, keeping in mind that we want to create a useful guide and avoid ineffective points.

Here's a structured redefinition:

*   **Keywords:** Non-linearity, stochasticity, fragmentation penalty, relative waste, array operations, multi-factor integration.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that integrate diverse factors through non-linear functions. Use stochastic elements for exploration while penalizing fragmented solutions. Evaluate waste relative to item size. Utilize efficient array operations for speed.

*   **Avoid:** Generic statements without concrete implementation strategies; vague descriptions of "exploration" without specifying the stochastic method.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a blend of diverse optimization techniques. Integrating non-linear functions allows to model complex relationships. Stochasticity balances exploration and exploitation. Relative waste is a more accurate measure than absolute waste. Utilizing array operations provides for efficient computation.
