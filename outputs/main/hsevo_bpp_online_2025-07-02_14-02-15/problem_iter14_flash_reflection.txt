**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both are identical. This suggests the ranking process might not be perfectly accurate or there are other factors influencing the ranking beyond the code itself.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the primary difference is that the 3rd version parameterizes most of the magic numbers, making the heuristic more configurable but also more complex. The 4th version has hardcoded values but introduces a dynamic "sweet spot" incentive, potentially improving performance.
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), these are identical, similar to the first two.

Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the best-fit prioritization in (5th) uses `10 / (waste + 0.0001)` while (1st) uses `1 / (waste + 0.00001)`.  The higher constant in the numerator in (5th) could lead to a stronger best-fit bias initially. Stochasticity in (5th) is scaled by `0.1 * np.mean(bins_remain_cap)`, which is adaptive to the bin fill levels, while (1st) scales with the number of feasible bins.  Fragmentation penalty in (5th) is a direct multiplication by 0.2, while (1st) has a more nuanced approach with `penalty_factor = 0.2 + item * 0.1`. The large item reward in (5th) uses a fixed threshold `item * 1.25`, while (1st) uses `1.5 * item` as the threshold to rewards.

Comparing (20th) vs (19th), they are identical.
Comparing (18th) vs (17th), these are identical.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), (20th) vs (19th) there is no difference
Overall: The better heuristics tend to incorporate item-size awareness into various components like fragmentation penalty, exploration factor and sweet spot incentives. They use adaptive stochasticity, often based on the number of feasible bins or the mean remaining capacity. Introducing a "sweet spot" to prioritize bins with utilization in a specific range seems to be a beneficial strategy. Penalizing fragmentation dynamically based on the size of the item being placed is also frequently observed in the better heuristics. Simpler is better, avoid unnescessary paramaterization.

**Experience:**

Favor item-aware heuristics. Adaptive stochasticity is better than fixed. Dynamic fragmentation penalties that consider item size are helpful. A sweet-spot incentive can improve performance. Start with simple adaptive components before introducing excessive customization through parameters.
