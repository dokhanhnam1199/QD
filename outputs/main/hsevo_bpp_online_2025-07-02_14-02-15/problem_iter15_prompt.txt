Prioritize adaptive mechanisms over static parameters. Use empirical testing to tune weights and thresholds.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, non-linear functions without justification, and excessive customization.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on gradual refinement and data-driven decisions. Begin with basic adaptive strategies and build upon them, avoiding overly complex models initially.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
