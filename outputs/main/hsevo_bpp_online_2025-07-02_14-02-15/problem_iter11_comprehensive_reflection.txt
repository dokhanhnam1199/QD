Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, while explicitly avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a revised perspective on self-reflection to guide heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Problem-Aware, Empirical Tuning, Balanced, Iterative Refinement.
*   **Advice:** Focus on a core, functional heuristic. Adapt parameters based on *observable* problem characteristics. Prioritize gradual, empirically validated refinements over complex, speculative features.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors without understanding their interactions, adding stochasticity without a clear purpose, and over-engineering with non-linear functions before establishing a solid foundation.
*   **Explanation:** Start simple, understand your base heuristic's performance, and then introduce targeted adaptations. The goal is controlled, explainable improvements based on data, not a black box of complex interactions.
