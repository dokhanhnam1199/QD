Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritizes best-fit, adds stochasticity, and penalizes fragmentation.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if np.any(feasible_bins):\n        waste = bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item\n        \n        # Prioritize based on inverse waste (best fit)\n        priorities[feasible_bins] = 1 / (waste + 0.0001)\n        \n        # Add stochasticity (exploration)\n        priorities[feasible_bins] += np.random.rand(np.sum(feasible_bins)) * 0.1\n\n        #Penalize almost full bins to prevent fragmentation\n        wasted_space_ratio = waste / bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins]\n        almost_full = wasted_space_ratio < 0.1\n        priorities[feasible_bins][almost_full] *= 0.5 # Reduce priority of almost full bins\n        \n\n        #Large item high reward - filling up space and avoiding future placement issues.\n        large_cap_reward = np.where(bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] > item*2,0.25,0) #incentivise large bins if enough capacity exists.\n        priorities[feasible_bins] += large_cap_reward\n\n    else:\n        priorities[:] = -np.inf\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective in guiding heuristic design.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Incremental improvement, base heuristic, parameter tuning, empirical validation.\n*   **Advice:** Begin with a solid, easily understood core heuristic. Introduce enhancements (e.g., fragmentation handling, specialized rules) one at a time. Meticulously adjust parameters using thorough testing.\n*   **Avoid:** Unnecessary complexity from the outset, premature optimization, reliance on intuition without data.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on controlled experimentation and data-driven adjustments. Add complexity gradually, verifying each addition's benefit through rigorous empirical validation. This prevents over-engineering and ensures each component contributes meaningfully.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
