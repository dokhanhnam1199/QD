**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristics aren't penalized for number of bins but do implement fragmentation and waste penalties. (2nd) vs (19th) are identical. (3rd) vs (18th) are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no difference. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no difference. Overall: The initial heuristics (1st-5th) are identical, and the later heuristics introduce a range of penalty and reward mechanisms, including fragmentation penalties, stochastic elements, and incentives for filling larger spaces, number of bins penalty. The functions incorporate diverse strategies, such as non-linear scaling and exploration factors to optimize bin usage.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with a simple, effective base and iteratively add complexities like fragmentation penalties, stochastic exploration, and incentives for specific scenarios (e.g., large items, nearly full bins). Carefully tune the weights and thresholds of these components based on empirical testing.
