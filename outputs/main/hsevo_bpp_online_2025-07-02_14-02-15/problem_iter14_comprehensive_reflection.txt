Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflection.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive components, empirical tuning, iterative refinement, problem state.
*   **Advice:** Build heuristics incrementally, starting with a simple, working base. Prioritize adaptive mechanisms over static parameters. Use empirical testing to tune weights and thresholds.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, non-linear functions without justification, and excessive customization.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on gradual refinement and data-driven decisions. Begin with basic adaptive strategies and build upon them, avoiding overly complex models initially.
