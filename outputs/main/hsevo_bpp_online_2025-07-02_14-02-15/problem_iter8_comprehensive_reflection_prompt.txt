{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors such as best-fit, fragmentation, and bin utilization. Adapt parameters dynamically based on the state of the problem. Experiment with different weighting schemes to balance exploration and exploitation.\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a simple, effective base and iteratively add complexities like fragmentation penalties, stochastic exploration, and incentives for specific scenarios (e.g., large items, nearly full bins). Carefully tune the weights and thresholds of these components based on empirical testing.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nCombining multiple factors with non-linear functions, incorporating stochasticity for exploration, penalizing fragmentation, and using array operations are key to designing effective heuristics. Also, considering relative waste to the item size instead of absolute waste is important.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
