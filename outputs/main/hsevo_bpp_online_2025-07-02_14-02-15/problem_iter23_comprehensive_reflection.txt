Here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for heuristic design, aiming for effective strategies:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Empirical, Incremental, Balance.

*   **Advice:** Focus on simple, adaptive components first. Validate each addition empirically before further complexity.

*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization, premature optimization, and complex, non-linear combinations of factors without clear justification.

*   **Explanation:** Start with a baseline heuristic, then add adaptive elements iteratively, ensuring each addition demonstrably improves performance through rigorous testing. Prioritize understandability and maintainability.
