**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic `priority_v2` incorporates "best-fit" prioritization, stochasticity for exploration, fragmentation penalty, utilization sweet spot, and large item reward. The worst only considers fit score (exponential decay on relative waste), stochasticity, and fragmentation penalty.  (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) the code is similar. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the function are similar, therefore small adjustments to parameters can significantly impact performance. (3rd) vs (4th), we see that the 4th heuristic dynamically adjusts stochasticity and rewards significantly filled bins, while the 3rd one is simpler. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the codes are similar. Overall: the best heuristics incorporate more factors and adaptive parameters, while simpler heuristics focusing only on basic factors like waste tend to perform worse. The weighting of different factors, such as the strength of the fragmentation penalty or the magnitude of stochasticity, significantly impacts heuristic performance. Sweet spot and dynamic scaling of parameters are useful.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors such as best-fit, fragmentation, and bin utilization. Adapt parameters dynamically based on the state of the problem. Experiment with different weighting schemes to balance exploration and exploitation.
