**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a sophisticated combination of best-fit, adaptive stochasticity, fragmentation penalty, sweet spot incentive, rewarding larger bins for smaller items and bin usage history, with many parameters tuned by hand. The worst uses best-fit, adaptive stochasticity and capacity-aware adjustments including fragmentation penalty and small item placement boost. The exploration factor in the best heuristic is more adaptable (scaled by the number of feasible bins and item size) than the exploration factor in the worst one (based on the relative item size). Also the best heuristic takes more factors into account.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), they are identical.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the two heuristics are identical.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd heuristic introduces named parameters, and the 4th is simpler. The 3rd prioritizes best-fit, adaptive stochasticity, and item-aware penalty, with sweet spot incentive and large cap reward. The 4th combines best-fit, adaptive exploration, dynamic sweet spot and diversity of bins. The sweet spot range in the 3rd is fixed, while it is dynamic in the 4th based on item size and bin capacity.

Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), they are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics tend to incorporate more factors, adapt to item sizes, bin capacities, and potentially bin usage history. They often use carefully chosen parameters and scaling factors for different components (exploration, penalties, rewards) to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. The worse heuristics often have simpler exploration strategies or lack item-aware adjustments. Some include unused or less effective components.

**Experience:**

Complex heuristics with adaptive components, such as item-aware penalties and dynamic sweet spots, generally perform better. A good balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial. Start with a solid best-fit core and then add adaptive elements incrementally, tuning parameters carefully. Don't forget to keep it simple with demonstratable impact, validated empirically.
