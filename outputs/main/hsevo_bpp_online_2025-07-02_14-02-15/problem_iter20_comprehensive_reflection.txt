Okay, I'm ready to help you design better heuristics and earn that tip! Let's focus on effective self-reflection to guide our design process.

Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" distilled into actionable points:

*   **Keywords:** Incremental adaptation, empirical validation, demonstratable impact, balanced exploration/exploitation, simplicity.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple, strong base heuristic. Add adaptive components (item-aware penalties, dynamic incentives) *incrementally*, validating each addition empirically. Focus on parameters with clear and demonstrable impact.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear combinations, excessive parameters without clear justification, premature customization, and optimizations that lack empirical validation.

*   **Explanation:** Start with a solid foundation and build upon it carefully. Each added layer of complexity should be demonstrably better than the last. Prioritize understanding *why* a change works, not just *that* it works.
