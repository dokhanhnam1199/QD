**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristics combine ratio-based and "gravitational" attraction approaches, including normalization and handling of infeasible bins; while the worst uses a simple log ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows the same contrast. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th), the 4th introduces an "almost_full_penalty," while the 3rd does not. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they're identical. Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors (remaining capacity, bin capacity, fullness penalty, ratios) and use more sophisticated calculations, including normalization and avoiding division by zero. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on ratios perform poorly. The exponential penalty for almost full bins is a valuable refinement.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing values, and penalizing undesirable states (e.g., almost full bins). Handle edge cases such as division by zero and infeasible solutions explicitly. Complex combinations of factors seem to perform better than simple ratios.
