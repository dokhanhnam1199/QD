Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to guide the design of better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls highlighted in the "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a refined perspective:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, Normalization, Dynamic penalties, Adaptive weighting, State-aware.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that synthesize several relevant factors, normalized to a common scale. Use dynamic penalties to discourage undesirable states, adapting to the problem's current state via adaptive weights. Incorporate state-aware components to make decisions based on current state.

*   **Avoid:** Single-factor metrics, relying on domain-specific analogies without rigorous justification, ignoring edge cases or infeasible solutions, and failing to normalize values.

*   **Explanation:** Combining normalized factors provides a more nuanced view than single metrics. Adaptive strategies allow the heuristic to adjust its behavior based on the current problem state, leading to more robust and effective solutions.
