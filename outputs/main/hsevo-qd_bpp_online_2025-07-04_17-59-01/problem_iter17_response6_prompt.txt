Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) reveals that the (2nd best) incorporates best-fit and adjusts weights based on bin fill level, features absent in (second worst). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the second best heuristics incorporates Best-fit priority and adjusts weights based on bin fill level. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), show that the 3rd heuristics also incorporates Best-fit priority and adjusts weights based on bin fill level. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst calculates \"Gravitational\" attraction with added constant. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors (ratio, gap, capacity, fill level) and use adaptive weights to dynamically adjust the importance of each factor. Handling of edge cases (division by zero, infeasible bins) with `np.where` is crucial. Normalization is also important.\n- \nHere's a redefinition of \"Current Self-Reflection\" tailored for designing effective heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, normalization, adaptive weights, state-awareness, edge-case handling, robustness, dynamic penalties.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple normalized, relevant factors with adaptive weights determined by the current problem state. Explicitly address edge cases and infeasible solution handling.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Relying on single-factor metrics, solely domain-specific analogies without quantitative justification.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Combines multiple relevant factors, normalizes inputs, and uses dynamic penalties to handle edge cases. Adaptive weighting can further improve performance by emphasizing different factors based on the problem's state. Edge case handling and normalization are essential for numerical stability and performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
