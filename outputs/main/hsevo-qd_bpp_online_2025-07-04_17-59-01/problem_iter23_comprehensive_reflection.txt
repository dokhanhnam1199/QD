Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor heuristics, adaptive weighting, normalization, state-awareness, penalty functions, edge case handling, exploration-exploitation balance.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently combine multiple problem-relevant factors. Prioritize adaptive weighting mechanisms driven by the current problem state to dynamically adjust the influence of each factor.

*   **Avoid:** Relying on single-factor metrics or analogies without strong problem relevance. Don't neglect normalization or robust edge case handling, as these are fundamental.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to be flexible and responsive to the changing problem landscape. By combining multiple normalized factors and adaptively weighting them based on the state, you create a more nuanced and powerful decision-making process. Penalties discourage undesirable outcomes, and careful edge case handling ensures robustness.
