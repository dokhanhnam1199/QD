**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic combines ratio, gap, and capacity with dynamic penalty and normalization, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) reveals that the (2nd best) incorporates best-fit and adjusts weights based on bin fill level, features absent in (second worst). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the second best heuristics incorporates Best-fit priority and adjusts weights based on bin fill level. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), show that the 3rd heuristics also incorporates Best-fit priority and adjusts weights based on bin fill level. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst calculates "Gravitational" attraction with added constant. Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors (ratio, gap, capacity, fill level) and use adaptive weights to dynamically adjust the importance of each factor. Handling of edge cases (division by zero, infeasible bins) with `np.where` is crucial. Normalization is also important.

**Experience:**

Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple relevant factors with adaptive weighting. Edge case handling and normalization are essential for numerical stability and performance. Consider incorporating state-aware components that account for the current state of the bins, such as fill level or bin diversity.
