Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to focus on actionable insights for heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective self-reflection." Here's a breakdown to help you design better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Factor combination, normalization, penalization, edge-case handling, complexity.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize complex formulas leveraging multiple normalized, relevant factors. Explicitly penalize undesirable intermediate states. Ensure robust handling of edge cases and infeasibility.

*   **Avoid:** Vague domain-specific analogies. Simple ratios or single-factor decisions. Ignoring intermediate state quality.

*   **Explanation:** Combining multiple normalized factors allows for a more nuanced evaluation of potential moves. Penalizing near-misses (e.g., almost full bins) guides the search towards better overall solutions. Robust edge-case handling prevents failures.
