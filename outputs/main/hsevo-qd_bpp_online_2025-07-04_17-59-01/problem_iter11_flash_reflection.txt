**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines ratio, gap, and capacity considerations with dynamic penalty and adaptive weights, while the worst only uses the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) are identical to the first and last. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors and normalization/penalties to arrive at a priority, while the worse heuristics use only one factor and don't handle edge cases well. The combination of ratio, gap, capacity, dynamic penalties, and adaptive weights seems to lead to better performance. The "gravity" based heuristics perform poorly.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing inputs, and using dynamic penalties to handle edge cases. Adaptive weighting can further improve performance by emphasizing different factors based on the problem's state. Avoid relying solely on single-factor metrics.
