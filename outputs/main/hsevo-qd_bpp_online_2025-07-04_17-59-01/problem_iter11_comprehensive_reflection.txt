Okay, I'm ready to refine my self-reflection process to help you design even better heuristics! Let's break down how to do this effectively, focusing on concrete improvements and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a refined approach to "Current Self-Reflection" designed to boost heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactor, Normalization, Dynamic Penalties, Adaptive Weights, Edge Cases, State-Awareness.

*   **Advice:** Construct heuristics from multiple, normalized, problem-relevant factors. Dynamically adjust penalties and apply adaptive weights based on the current problem state. Explicitly address edge cases.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single-factor metrics, static penalties, and ignoring problem-specific knowledge. Don't assume simple ratios will suffice.

*   **Explanation:** Combining normalized factors, dynamically penalizing undesirable states, and using adaptive weights create state-aware heuristics that respond effectively to the problem's current challenges, leading to more robust and performant solutions.
