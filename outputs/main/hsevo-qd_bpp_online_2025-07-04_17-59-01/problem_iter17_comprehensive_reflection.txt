Here's a redefinition of "Current Self-Reflection" tailored for designing effective heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, normalization, adaptive weights, state-awareness, edge-case handling, robustness, dynamic penalties.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple normalized, relevant factors with adaptive weights determined by the current problem state. Explicitly address edge cases and infeasible solution handling.

*   **Avoid:** Relying on single-factor metrics, solely domain-specific analogies without quantitative justification.

*   **Explanation:** Combines multiple relevant factors, normalizes inputs, and uses dynamic penalties to handle edge cases. Adaptive weighting can further improve performance by emphasizing different factors based on the problem's state. Edge case handling and normalization are essential for numerical stability and performance.
