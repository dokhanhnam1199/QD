**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines ratio, gap, capacity, best-fit, and dynamic weights, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) also shows a similar contrast. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both heuristics are exactly identical, suggesting their performance is statistically similar. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both heuristics only considers the ratio between item and bins capacity, however the former uses log and the latter doesn't. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors (gap, capacity, dynamic penalties, adaptive weights) and use normalization techniques. They also dynamically adjust weights based on item size and bin state. Simpler heuristics relying solely on ratios tend to perform worse. The dynamic "almost full" penalty and the fill level balancing term appear in the higher-ranked heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and normalizing them. Adaptive weighting based on the problem state (e.g., item size, bin capacity distribution) can improve performance. Adding penalties for undesirable states (e.g., almost full bins) and balancing terms to encourage exploration can also be beneficial.
