Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n       Newton's insightful heuristic considers gravitational attraction - smaller gap and larger bin capacity means higher attraction.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure no division by zero\n    bins_remain_cap = np.where(bins_remain_cap == 0, 1e-9, bins_remain_cap) # a very small number to avoid division by zero\n\n    # Calculate gap (remaining capacity after placing the item)\n    gap = bins_remain_cap - item\n    # bins where gap < 0 are not feasible: assign a very small priority.\n    gap = np.where(gap < 0, -1, gap)\n    \n    # \"Gravitational\" attraction: inversely proportional to a power of the distance (gap) and directly propotional to bin capacity\n\n    priorities = np.where(gap >= 0, bins_remain_cap / (gap**2 + 0.0001), -1e9) # Added small constant to prevent possible 0 division.

Systematically analyze heuristic failures, identifying patterns and potential adaptations. Balance exploration (trying new placement strategies) with exploitation (refining existing ones).\n*   **Avoid:** Focusing solely on average-case performance; Ignoring worst-case scenarios; Premature convergence.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves iterative improvement based on *data-driven* analysis of heuristic *performance*. This requires rigorous testing, failure analysis, and a willingness to adapt the heuristic's strategy.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
