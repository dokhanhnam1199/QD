**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the primary difference lies in the priority calculation. The better heuristic uses a physics-inspired approach (gravitational attraction), considering both the remaining capacity of the bin and the gap after placing the item. The worse heuristic simply uses the negative log of the ratio between item size and remaining capacity.
Comparing (11th) vs (20th), there are no differences, and all heuristics from 11th to 20th share same source code.
Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the key differences is that the 1st heuristics accounts for both bin capacity and gap while the 11th heuristics (and below) only accounts for ratios. The 1st heuristic also has a robust mechanism for dealing with infeasible bins (bins with negative gap) by assigning a very small priority. Finally 1st heuristic has a constant 0.0001 to prevent zero division, where the others does not.
Overall: The "gravitational attraction" approach appears to be more effective for priority calculation in this bin packing context. The gap, penalizing infeasible options, and considering both bin size and gap provide more robust performance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider incorporating domain-specific knowledge or analogies (like gravity). Account for the remaining capacity of bins as well as the gap after placing the item. Handle edge cases (e.g., infeasible bins, division by zero) gracefully for robustness.
