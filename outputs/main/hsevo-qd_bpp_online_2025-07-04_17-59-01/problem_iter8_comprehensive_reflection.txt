Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection" and gearing up for that generous tip!

Here's the refined definition:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Normalization, Dynamic Penalties, Adaptive Weights, State-Aware, Edge Case Handling.
*   **Advice:** Integrate multiple relevant factors with normalization, implement dynamic penalty adjustments based on the current problem state, and explore adaptive weighting schemes.
*   **Avoid:** Vague "domain-specific knowledge" or analogies without concrete implementation. Focus on quantifiable elements like Capacity and Gap but go beyond simple ratios.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics combine problem-specific factors mathematically, adjust dynamically based on the current state of the solution, and handle potential errors robustly. Focus on building testable strategies.
