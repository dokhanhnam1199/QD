**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic combines several factors (ratio, gap, capacity, fullness, perfect fit) with adaptive weights, while the last only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd) vs (19th) shows that the second heuristic combines ratio, gap, capacity, best-fit, and dynamic weights, while the 19th focuses on ratio and a "gravitational" attraction with some added constants. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one explicitly favors bins that can be perfectly filled, and includes dynamic adjustment to handle almost-full bins using an exponential penalty, it also uses adaptive weights based on item size and average capacity. In contrast, the second version lacks perfect fit consideration, uses different method to dynamically weigh best fit and introduces bin fill level concept. (3rd) vs (4th) show that the 4th one explicitly normalizes the best-fit priority and uses bin fill level to adjust weights for best-fit, ratio, gap and capacity. Heuristic 3rd lacks this normalization of best fit priority. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst `priority_v2` function considers gap and ratio, and applies penalty, the worst function only considers ratio of item size to bin capacity. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors, use adaptive weighting, include normalization, handle edge cases carefully (division by zero, empty input), and demonstrate state awareness (e.g., considering how full bins already are). They penalize nearly full bins more effectively.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights based on problem state. Normalize your inputs, implement penalties for undesirable states, handle edge cases, and strive for state awareness to reflect current conditions.
