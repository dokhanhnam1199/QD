**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines ratio, gap, capacity, dynamic penalty, bin usage, and adaptive weights, while the worst only considers the ratio between item size and remaining bin capacity. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the 1st includes bin usage and adaptive weights based on item size and average bin capacity, while the 6th lacks bin usage and uses adaptive weights based only on item size. Comparing (6th) vs (17th), 6th includes gap, capacity, and dynamic penalty, while the 17th only considers ratio. Comparing (14th) vs (17th), we see that (14th) uses both ratio-based and gravity-inspired approaches, while (17th) is purely ratio-based. Comparing (15th) vs (14th), (15th) introduces tunable parameters and penalties. Comparing (11th) vs (14th), (11th) includes feasibility checks, comprehensive priorities (ratio, gap, capacity, fill level), and handles edge cases, while (14th) simplifies to ratio and gravity. The handling of infeasible bins and the diversity/balancing term are also unique to the higher-ranked heuristics. Overall: More sophisticated heuristics consider multiple factors like ratio, gap, capacity, bin usage, and dynamically adjust weights and penalties, and carefully handles edge cases such as infeasibility. Simpler heuristics only focus on a single factor like ratio or a limited combination of factors. Introducing tunable parameters does not guarantee better performance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and dynamically adjusting their importance based on the problem state. Properly handling edge cases and infeasible solutions is critical for robustness. Normalization is essential to combine values with different scale, because combining unscaled metrics may lead to undesired behaviors.
