**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers a combination of ratio, gap, and capacity, along with a dynamic penalty for almost full bins, while the worst only considers the log of the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd) to (19th) are similarly worse as 20th. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the 1st heuristic considers ratio and gap in a different mathematical form than "gravitational attraction" which also includes the capacity. Comparing (6th) vs (11th), 6th uses a simpler form for the gap penalty compared to the gravitational attraction. Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the 1st incorporates capacity-based priority, dynamic scaling of the almost-full penalty, and adaptive weights based on item size, whereas the 6th uses a simpler penalty and combines only ratio and gap priorities. Comparing (16th) vs (18th), the 16th includes constants as tuned parameters in ratio, gravity, and penalty, while the 18th only consider ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (16th), the 1st heuristic combines ratio, gap, and capacity with dynamic penalty, normalization, and item size-based weights. The 16th combines ratio and gravity, also utilizing normalization and tuned parameters. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors, normalize values, dynamically scale penalties, and adapt weights, while the worse heuristics rely on fewer factors and simpler calculations. The best heuristics use carefully chosen combinations of ratio, gap, and capacity, along with penalties to guide the item placement in a bin

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing values to a common scale, and dynamically adjusting penalties based on the current state. Adaptive weights can further improve performance. Consider Ratio, Gap, and Capacity in bin packing problems.
