{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights based on problem state. Normalize your inputs, implement penalties for undesirable states, handle edge cases, and strive for state awareness to reflect current conditions.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing values, and penalizing undesirable states (e.g., almost full bins). Handle edge cases such as division by zero and infeasible solutions explicitly. Complex combinations of factors seem to perform better than simple ratios.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing values to a common scale, and dynamically adjusting penalties based on the current state. Adaptive weights can further improve performance. Consider Ratio, Gap, and Capacity in bin packing problems.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing inputs, and using dynamic penalties to handle edge cases. Adaptive weighting can further improve performance by emphasizing different factors based on the problem's state. Avoid relying solely on single-factor metrics.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and dynamically adjusting their importance based on the problem state. Properly handling edge cases and infeasible solutions is critical for robustness. Normalization is essential to combine values with different scale, because combining unscaled metrics may lead to undesired behaviors.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and normalizing them. Adaptive weighting based on the problem state (e.g., item size, bin capacity distribution) can improve performance. Adding penalties for undesirable states (e.g., almost full bins) and balancing terms to encourage exploration can also be beneficial.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider incorporating domain-specific knowledge or analogies (like gravity). Account for the remaining capacity of bins as well as the gap after placing the item. Handle edge cases (e.g., infeasible bins, division by zero) gracefully for robustness.\n\nPrioritize heuristics that combine multiple relevant factors with adaptive weighting. Edge case handling and normalization are essential for numerical stability and performance. Consider incorporating state-aware components that account for the current state of the bins, such as fill level or bin diversity.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
