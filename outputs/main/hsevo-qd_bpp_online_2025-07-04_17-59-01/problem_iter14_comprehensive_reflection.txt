Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to maximize its usefulness in heuristic design. We'll focus on actionable advice and avoid vague suggestions.

*   **Keywords:** Factor Combination, Normalization, Dynamic Penalties, Adaptive Weights, Edge Case Handling, Problem State, Multi-Factor.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize combining multiple *normalized* factors, and adjust their relative importance (weights/penalties) *dynamically* based on the current problem state to reflect its context and needs.

*   **Avoid:** Relying on single factor, static approaches, unscaled values, or ignoring edge cases/infeasibility. Avoid vague, domain-specific suggestions.

*   **Explanation:** Combining normalized factors allows a more holistic view. Dynamic penalties and adaptive weights enable the heuristic to react intelligently to the search space and problem features by emphasizing the most critical factor at a given moment.
