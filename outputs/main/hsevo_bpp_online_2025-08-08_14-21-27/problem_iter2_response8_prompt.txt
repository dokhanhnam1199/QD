The 1st and 4th are nearly identical in their implementation and docstrings, with the 4th having a slightl\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Prioritization, Dynamic Evaluation, Predictive Performance, Causal Analysis.\n*   **Advice:** Instead of solely relying on static or post-hoc comparisons, focus on *predicting* the future impact of heuristic choices. Experiment with actively *adapting* the heuristic's logic based on early performance signals during a run.\n*   **Avoid:** Repeating analyses of near-identical implementations. Over-reliance on single-metric comparisons without considering the underlying mechanisms.\n*   **Explanation:** Truly improving heuristics requires understanding *why* certain strategies work or fail, not just observing superficial similarities. Analyze the *causal relationship* between a heuristic's choice and the overall solution quality to drive innovation.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
