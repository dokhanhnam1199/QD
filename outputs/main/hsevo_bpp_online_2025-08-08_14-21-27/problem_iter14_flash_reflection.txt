**Analysis:**

*   **Heuristics 1 & 2 vs. 3 & 5:** Heuristics 1 and 2 use a weighted sum and include a logarithmic adaptive bonus, which is more nuanced than the multiplicative combination of Best Fit and Fill Ratio in 3 and 5. The inclusion of a "fullness bonus" (inverse of remaining capacity) and an "adaptive bonus" (logarithm of remaining capacity) in 1 and 2 provides a more sophisticated scoring mechanism. Heuristics 3 and 5 use a simple multiplicative combination, which might be less robust to extreme values.
*   **Heuristics 1 & 2 vs. 4:** Heuristic 4 uses a multiplicative combination with a simpler fullness score than 1 and 2. Heuristics 1 and 2's additive combination with a logarithmic penalty seems more robust and less prone to over-penalizing due to multiplication. The "adaptive bonus" in 1 and 2 offers finer control over penalizing large leftover spaces.
*   **Heuristics 1 & 2 vs. 6 & 9:** Heuristics 6 and 9 also use a multiplicative combination with a logarithmic bonus. However, they apply it as `best_fit_scores * (1.0 + fullness_bonus * 0.2)`, which might be less balanced than the additive approach in 1 and 2, especially if `fullness_bonus` becomes very large. Heuristics 1 and 2's use of a weighted sum with an *inversion* of the adaptive bonus (`- (adaptive_bonus * 0.2)`) suggests a more deliberate attempt to balance fitting tightness and residual space.
*   **Heuristics 3 & 5 vs. 7 & 11 & 12 & 14 & 20:** Heuristics 7, 11, 12, 14, and 20 are similar in their multiplicative combination of Best Fit and Fill Ratio. However, 11, 12, 14, and 20 attempt to refine this by handling empty bins or adding small constants, making them slightly more robust. Heuristic 7's fill ratio calculation (`1.0 / (fittable_bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)`) is a bit simplistic and might not clearly represent "fullness" as well as calculating `1 - remaining_capacity/capacity`. Heuristics 11, 12, 14, and 20 are very similar, with the `np.maximum` refinement in 11, 12, and 14 adding a useful layer.
*   **Heuristics 8 vs. others:** Heuristic 8 uses a multiplicative combination with a fullness score based on `1.0 - (fittable_bins_remain_cap / max_initial_remain_cap)`. This is a reasonable approach, but the specific formula for `best_fit_scores` (`1.0 / (fittable_bins_remain_cap - item + 1.0)`) is less aggressive than `1.0 / (fittable_bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)`, potentially making it less sensitive to very tight fits.
*   **Heuristics 10, 13, 15, 17, 19:** These heuristics have incomplete code bodies (only the function signature and docstring, or just the signature and mask). Their actual logic is not present, making direct comparison impossible. They seem to be placeholders or intended to be filled.
*   **Heuristics 16 & 18:** Similar to the above, these also have incomplete implementations. They mention a "fill ratio" bonus but don't show its calculation or how it's combined.
*   **Overall Ranking Rationale:** Heuristics 1 and 2 stand out due to their additive combination strategy, the inclusion of a weighted sum of multiple factors (Best Fit, Fullness Bonus, Adaptive Bonus), and the use of logarithmic scaling for finer control. This suggests a more balanced and adaptable approach. Heuristics 11, 12, 14, and 20 follow with their multiplicative Best Fit + Fill Ratio approach, enhanced by refinements for edge cases like empty bins. Heuristic 4 is a simpler version of the multiplicative approach. Heuristics 3 and 5 are basic multiplicative combinations. Heuristic 8 has a slightly less aggressive Best Fit component. Heuristics 7 is similar but with a less robust fill ratio calculation. Heuristics 6 and 9 use a multiplicative approach that might be less balanced than the additive approach in 1 and 2. The incomplete heuristics (10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19) are ranked lowest due to their lack of implementational detail.

**Experience:**
Designing effective heuristics involves balancing multiple objectives (e.g., tight fit, bin fullness). Additive combinations with nuanced terms (like logarithmic bonuses) offer more control than simple multiplication. Robustness to edge cases (like empty bins) and careful normalization are crucial for reliable performance.
