Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines Best Fit with a bonus for already full bins, using a logarithmic bonus\n    to balance tight fits with encouraging fuller bins.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    fittable_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(fittable_bins_mask):\n        return priorities\n\n    fittable_bins_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap[fittable_bins_mask]\n\n    # Best Fit Score: Higher for bins that leave less remaining capacity.\n    # Adding a small epsilon to avoid division by zero.\n    best_fit_scores = 1.0 / (fittable_bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6)\n\n    # Fullness Bonus: A bonus for bins that are already more full.\n    # Using the inverse of remaining capacity on fittable bins.\n    # Normalize by the maximum remaining capacity among fittable bins to get a relative measure.\n    max_remaining_cap_fittable = np.max(fittable_bins_remain_cap)\n    fullness_bonus = (max_remaining_cap_fittable - fittable_bins_remain_cap) / (max_remaining_cap_fittable + 1e-6)\n\n    # Adaptive Bonus using logarithm of remaining capacity after fit.\n    # This penalizes leaving excessively large gaps but gives smaller penalties for smaller gaps.\n    # Adding 1 to prevent log(0) and ensure positive values.\n    adaptive_bonus = np.log1p(fittable_bins_remain_cap - item)\n\n    # Combine: Weighted sum of Best Fit and Fullness Bonus, with Adaptive Bonus as a modifier.\n    # Weights are heuristic and can be tuned.

Prioritize explicit balancing of immediate packing efficiency and future bin utility. Implement adaptive weighting based on item characteristics for improved robustness.\n*   **Avoid:** Redundant heuristics, overly aggressive multiplicative combinations without clear justification, and implicit assumptions about scale or edge cases. Do not rely on near-identical implementations.\n*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes clarity, adaptability, and the avoidance of duplication. It suggests building complex behaviors from well-understood, controlled components rather than relying on opaque, potentially brittle multiplicative interactions or redundant strategies.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
