    Richard Feynman's "Quantum Hop" Priority for Bin Packing:
    Let's think about this. We've got these items, right? And we've got these bins.
    We want to pack 'em up, neat and tidy, with as few bins as possible.
    It's like trying to fit all your thoughts into your brain, and you want to do it efficiently, so you don't get cluttered.

    Now, with this "Random Fit" business, it's not about being perfectly clever every time.
    It's more like... a hunch. A good guess. Sometimes, you gotta just pick a path and see where it leads.
    We get an item, a new thought, and we have these bins, these mental compartments, each with some space left.
    We want to assign a "priority" to each bin, saying how good a fit it *might* be.

    My idea? Let's give a higher priority to bins that are *almost* full, but not *too* full.
    Why? Because if a bin is almost full, putting this item in might just finish it off, or at least make it quite full. That's a good use of space, a satisfying "closure."
    But if a bin is practically empty, or if the item *barely* fits, well, that doesn't feel as right. It's like trying to cram a tiny pebble into a vast stadium – it doesn't quite *fill* the purpose.

    So, for each bin, let's calculate this "priority score."
    It's like a little dance.
    If the item fits in the bin (capacity >= item), that's a good start. No priority if it doesn't fit – that's a no-go zone.
    If it fits, how much space is left *after* we put the item in? That's `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    We want this remaining space to be small, but not negative (that's why we checked `bins_remain_cap >= item`).
    Let's say `residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    Now, we want to maximize the "goodness" of this residual capacity.
    If `residual_capacity` is zero, that's perfect! The bin is full. Max priority.
    If `residual_capacity` is small and positive, that's also good. High priority.
    If `residual_capacity` is large, that's not as great. We're not using the bin efficiently. Lower priority.

    So, let's try this:
    For each bin, if the item fits:
        Calculate the leftover space: `leftover = bin_capacity - item`
        The priority is inversely related to `leftover`. More leftover, less priority.
        A simple way to do this is to make the priority proportional to `1 / (1 + leftover)`.
        This way, if `leftover` is 0, priority is 1. If `leftover` is large, priority approaches 0.

    What if the item doesn't fit? The priority is 0. A firm no.

    Let's put it all together.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] - item
    
    # We want to give a higher priority to bins with less residual capacity after packing.
    # A residual capacity of 0 is ideal. Large residual capacity is less ideal.
    # The formula 1 / (1 + residual_capacity) captures this:
    # If residual_capacity is 0, priority is 1 / (1 + 0) = 1.
    # If residual_capacity is large, say 100, priority is 1 / (1 + 100) = 1/101, which is small.
    # This gives a "quantum hop" towards the more filled bins without being too rigid.
    priorities[fits_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + residual_capacity)
    
    return priorities
