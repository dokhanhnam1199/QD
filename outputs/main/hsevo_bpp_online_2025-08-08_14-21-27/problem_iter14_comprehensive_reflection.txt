Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on overcoming ineffective practices:

*   **Keywords:** Objective Combination, Adaptive Weighting, Multiplicative Scoring, Robustness.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* certain objective combinations work, not just *that* they work. Explicitly model trade-offs using multiplicative or weighted additive functions, and proactively test for edge cases that break simple rules.
*   **Avoid:** Redundant comparisons of nearly identical implementations, treating similar scoring mechanisms as distinct, and vague justifications for complexity. Do not overlook the *interaction* between objective components.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection means dissecting the *mechanism* of success. Instead of stating "combine objectives," analyze *how* a multiplicative approach balances fitting an item now versus leaving usable space for later. This analytical depth guides the creation of truly novel and robust heuristics.
