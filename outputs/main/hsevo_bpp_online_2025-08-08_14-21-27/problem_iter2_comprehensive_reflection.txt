Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Prioritization, Dynamic Evaluation, Predictive Performance, Causal Analysis.
*   **Advice:** Instead of solely relying on static or post-hoc comparisons, focus on *predicting* the future impact of heuristic choices. Experiment with actively *adapting* the heuristic's logic based on early performance signals during a run.
*   **Avoid:** Repeating analyses of near-identical implementations. Over-reliance on single-metric comparisons without considering the underlying mechanisms.
*   **Explanation:** Truly improving heuristics requires understanding *why* certain strategies work or fail, not just observing superficial similarities. Analyze the *causal relationship* between a heuristic's choice and the overall solution quality to drive innovation.
