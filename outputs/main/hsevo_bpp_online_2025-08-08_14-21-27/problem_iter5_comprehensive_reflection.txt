Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Balance, Utility, Efficiency, Simplicity, Exploration Bias.
*   **Advice:** Focus on simple, quantifiable metrics that capture both immediate fit and long-term potential. Introduce complexity *only* when data clearly indicates current strategies are insufficient.
*   **Avoid:** Redundant implementations that offer marginal improvements. Over-reliance on arbitrary thresholds or overly complex weighting schemes without empirical justification.
*   **Explanation:** Ineffective reflection often gets bogged down in minor implementation differences. Effective reflection questions *why* a strategy is chosen, assessing its core principle and its impact on the overall objective (better packing). Strive for elegant solutions, not just variations on a theme.
