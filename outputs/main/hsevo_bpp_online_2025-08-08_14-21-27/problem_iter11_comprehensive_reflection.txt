Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective optimization, multiplicative scoring, adaptive weighting, robustness, simplification.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that explicitly balance immediate packing gains (e.g., Best Fit) with long-term bin utilization (e.g., fill ratio). Experiment with multiplicative combinations of these metrics.
*   **Avoid:** Redundant implementations, overly complex scoring functions without clear justification, and heuristics that don't directly address the trade-off between immediate and future packing efficiency.
*   **Explanation:** Focusing on combining well-performing, conceptually distinct metrics multiplicatively creates synergistic effects. Avoiding complexity ensures interpretability and easier tuning, leading to more robust and generalizable heuristics.
