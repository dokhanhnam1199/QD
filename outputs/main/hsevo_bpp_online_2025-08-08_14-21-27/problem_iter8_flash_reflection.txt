**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1st and 2nd, 1st uses `eligible_bins / (max_eligible_cap + 1e-9)` for fill ratio, while 2nd uses `fittable_bins_remain_cap / (max_eligible_cap + 1e-9)`. 1st's approach seems more directly related to how full the bin is relative to other fitting bins.

Comparing Heuristics 2nd and 7th (which are identical), no change is observed.

Comparing Heuristics 4th and 8th (which are identical), no change is observed.

Comparing Heuristics 5th and Heuristics 14th/15th/16th: Heuristics 14-16 attempt to incorporate an "adaptive bonus" based on the logarithm of the resulting remainder, aiming to balance tight fits with leaving some space. Heuristic 5th solely relies on inverse difference (Best Fit). The inclusion of an adaptive bonus in 14-16 suggests a more nuanced approach than simple Best Fit.

Comparing Heuristics 10th/11th/12th/13th with others: These heuristics combine proximity with fill ratio. Heuristic 10th's `proximity_score * fill_ratio_score` seems like a straightforward combination. The `np.maximum(combined_score, proximity_score * (current_fill_ratio > 1e-9))` attempts to ensure proximity is considered even for empty bins, which is a good robustness measure.

Comparing Heuristics 17th/18th/19th/20th: These heuristics use `base_priority + adaptive_bonus`, where `base_priority` is Best Fit and `adaptive_bonus` is `remaining_capacity_after_fit * 0.5`. This additive approach for the bonus is a simpler alternative to multiplicative combinations seen in other heuristics.

Overall: Heuristics that combine multiple factors (Best Fit, Fill Ratio, adaptive bonuses) tend to be ranked higher. The specific combination method (multiplicative vs. additive) and the nature of the adaptive bonus (logarithmic, linear scaling) seem to differentiate performance. Normalization is consistently applied to keep scores in a comparable range.

**Experience:**
Combine multiple objectives (e.g., Best Fit, Fill Ratio) using multiplicative or additive approaches. Adaptive bonuses that reward moderate remaining space can improve performance over pure Best Fit. Ensure robustness with normalization and by handling edge cases like empty bins or perfect fits.
