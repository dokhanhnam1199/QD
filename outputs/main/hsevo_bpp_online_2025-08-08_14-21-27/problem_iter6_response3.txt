    Calculates priority scores for bins using a blended strategy that balances
    immediate fit (Proximity Fit) with long-term bin utility (Maximizing Remaining Capacity).
    
    Prioritizes bins that are a good fit for the current item, but also considers
    bins that, while not the "tightest" fit, leave more residual capacity for future items,
    potentially reducing the number of new bins needed overall.

    The scoring mechanism aims to:
    1. Favor bins where the remaining capacity is close to the item size (minimizing waste).
    2. Slightly penalize bins that would be *too* close to a perfect fit if a slightly larger
       item could have been accommodated. This encourages leaving slightly more room for
       potentially larger future items.
    3. Normalize scores to ensure a relative comparison among
