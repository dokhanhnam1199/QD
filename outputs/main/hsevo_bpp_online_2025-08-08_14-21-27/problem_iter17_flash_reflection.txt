**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1st (weighted additive with log bonus) vs. Heuristic 2nd (multiplicative best-fit and fill ratio): Heuristic 1st attempts a more nuanced combination with a logarithmic term to manage leftover space, which can be more stable. Heuristic 2nd uses a simple multiplicative approach which can be too aggressive.

Comparing Heuristic 1st (weighted additive with log bonus) vs. Heuristic 3rd (complex additive with multiple components): Heuristic 1st is simpler and more direct. Heuristic 3rd's attempt at "Proximity to Half-Capacity" and "Worst Fit Incentive" without clear definitions or robust proxies makes it less reliable.

Comparing Heuristic 2nd (multiplicative best-fit and fill ratio) vs. Heuristic 5th (identical to 2nd, possibly a copy-paste error): They are identical, making comparison moot for ranking. However, the core idea of multiplicative best-fit and fill ratio is present in 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th. Heuristic 10th uses a logarithmic fill bonus, which is a slight variation. Heuristics 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th are indeed identical.

Comparing Heuristic 4th (multiplicative with explicit penalty/bonus) vs. Heuristic 9th (multiplicative best-fit and normalized fullness): Heuristic 4th's explicit `1.0 / (1.0 + leftover_space_penalty)` is a reasonable way to incorporate a penalty, but the interaction with other terms might be sensitive. Heuristic 9th's `fullness_scores = 1.0 - (fittable_bins_remain_cap / max_initial_remain_cap)` attempts to normalize fullness, which can be more robust than absolute remaining capacity. However, it adds a constant `+ 0.1` to `fullness_scores` before multiplication, which is a heuristic dampener.

Comparing Heuristic 1st (weighted additive) vs. Heuristic 12th (multiplicative with adaptive tightness): Heuristic 1st's additive approach is generally more controllable than Heuristic 12th's multiplicative approach, especially with an exponential tightness component which can be sensitive. Heuristic 12th's `(1.0 - large_bin_penalty_component)` might lead to negative values if `large_bin_penalty_component` is greater than 1, which is unlikely here but a potential issue.

Comparing Heuristic 2nd (multiplicative best-fit and fill ratio) vs. Heuristic 10th (multiplicative best-fit and log fullness bonus): Heuristic 10th's use of `log1p(1.0 / (fittable_bins_remain_cap + 1e-9))` for fullness is a more sophisticated way to handle varying levels of fullness compared to Heuristic 2nd's simple inverse.

Overall: Heuristic 1st seems to strike a good balance between simplicity, interpretability, and robustness with its weighted additive approach. Multiplicative combinations (like Heuristics 2nd, 4th, 9th, 10th) can be powerful but risk being too sensitive to specific term values or interactions. Heuristics involving complex adaptive terms or unclear proxies (like parts of Heuristic 3rd, 12th, 13th, 14th) are harder to justify without empirical validation. The numerous identical heuristics (5th, 6th, 7th, 8th) are a clear weakness in the list.

**Experience:**
Additive combinations offer more control and interpretability than aggressive multiplicative ones. Normalize components or use carefully crafted terms to manage scale. Prioritize robustness (avoiding division by zero, handling edge cases) and clarity in heuristic logic. Identical heuristics are redundant and weaken perceived quality.
