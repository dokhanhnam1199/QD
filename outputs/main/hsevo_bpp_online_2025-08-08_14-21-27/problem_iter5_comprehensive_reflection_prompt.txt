{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize heuristics that directly balance immediate packing efficiency (proximity to item size) with future utility (non-wasteful remainders). A multiplicative scoring approach, like combining fill ratio and proximity, often yields good results by implicitly penalizing large remaining capacities. Avoid overly complex combinations or exploration biases unless specific problem characteristics warrant them.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nComparing (1st) vs (3rd) and (4th), all three implement a similar strategy: assigning priority inversely proportional to the remaining capacity after placing the item, using `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[eligible_bins_mask] - item + 1e-9)`. The 1st and 4th are nearly identical in their implementation and docstrings, with the 4th having a slightly\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
