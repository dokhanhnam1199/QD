Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Heuristic 5th solely relies on inverse difference (Best Fit). The inclusion of an adaptive bonus in 14-16 suggests a more nuanced approach than simple Best Fit.\n\nComparing Heuristics 10th/11th/12th/13th with others: These heuristics combine proximity with fill ratio. Heuristic 10th's `proximity_score * fill_ratio_score` seems like a straightforward combination. The `np.maximum(combined_score, proximity_score * (current_fill_ratio > 1e-9))` attempts to ensure proximity is considered even for empty bins, which is a good robustness measure.\n\nComparing Heuristics 17th/18th/19th/20th: These heuristics use `base_priority + adaptive_bonus`, where `base_priority` is Best Fit and `adaptive_bonus` is `remaining_capacity_after_fit * 0.5`. This additive approach for the bonus is a simpler alternative to multiplicative combinations seen in other heuristics.\n\nOverall: Heuristics that combine multiple factors (Best Fit, Fill Ratio, adaptive bonuses) tend to be ranked higher. The specific combination method (multiplicative vs. additive) and the nature of the adaptive bonus (logarithmic, linear scaling) seem to differentiate performance. Normalization is consistently applied to keep scores in a comparable range.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective Alignment, Trade-offs, Robustness, Predictive Power.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on aligning heuristic scoring with underlying optimization goals, explicitly modeling trade-offs between immediate gains and future packing potential. Use adaptive mechanisms that learn or respond to problem state for enhanced predictive power.\n*   **Avoid:** Redundant comparisons of near-identical strategies. Overly simplistic or static weighting schemes that don't account for dynamic problem states or interactions between objectives.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection identifies *why* a heuristic works or fails, focusing on the underlying principles and interactions. This allows for the creation of more sophisticated, robust, and predictive heuristics by understanding the nuanced trade-offs and potential future implications of each decision.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
