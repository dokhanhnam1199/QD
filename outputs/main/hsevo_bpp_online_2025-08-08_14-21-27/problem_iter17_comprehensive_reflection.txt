Here's a redefined "Current self-reflection" focused on designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Adaptive Weighting, Robustness, Interpretability, Granular Control.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with granular control via additive components, carefully normalized. Prioritize explicit balancing of immediate packing efficiency and future bin utility. Implement adaptive weighting based on item characteristics for improved robustness.
*   **Avoid:** Redundant heuristics, overly aggressive multiplicative combinations without clear justification, and implicit assumptions about scale or edge cases. Do not rely on near-identical implementations.
*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes clarity, adaptability, and the avoidance of duplication. It suggests building complex behaviors from well-understood, controlled components rather than relying on opaque, potentially brittle multiplicative interactions or redundant strategies.
