Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Objective Alignment, Trade-offs, Robustness, Predictive Power.
*   **Advice:** Focus on aligning heuristic scoring with underlying optimization goals, explicitly modeling trade-offs between immediate gains and future packing potential. Use adaptive mechanisms that learn or respond to problem state for enhanced predictive power.
*   **Avoid:** Redundant comparisons of near-identical strategies. Overly simplistic or static weighting schemes that don't account for dynamic problem states or interactions between objectives.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection identifies *why* a heuristic works or fails, focusing on the underlying principles and interactions. This allows for the creation of more sophisticated, robust, and predictive heuristics by understanding the nuanced trade-offs and potential future implications of each decision.
