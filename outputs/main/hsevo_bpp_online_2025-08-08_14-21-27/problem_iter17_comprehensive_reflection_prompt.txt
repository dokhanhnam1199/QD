{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nAdditive combinations offer more control and interpretability than aggressive multiplicative ones. Normalize components or use carefully crafted terms to manage scale. Prioritize robustness (avoiding division by zero, handling edge cases) and clarity in heuristic logic. Identical heuristics are redundant and weaken perceived quality.\nCombine multiple objectives (e.g., Best Fit, Fill Ratio) using multiplicative or additive approaches. Adaptive bonuses that reward moderate remaining space can improve performance over pure Best Fit. Ensure robustness with normalization and by handling edge cases like empty bins or perfect fits.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nComparing (1st) vs (3rd) and (4th), all three implement a similar strategy: assigning priority inversely proportional to the remaining capacity after placing the item, using `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[eligible_bins_mask] - item + 1e-9)`. The 1st and 4th are nearly identical in their implementation and docstrings, with the 4th having a slightly\n\nPrioritize heuristics that directly balance immediate packing efficiency (proximity to item size) with future utility (non-wasteful remainders). A multiplicative scoring approach, like combining fill ratio and proximity, often yields good results by implicitly penalizing large remaining capacities. Avoid overly complex combinations or exploration biases unless specific problem characteristics warrant them.\n\nHeuristics combining Best Fit with a \"fullness\" or \"fill ratio\" metric often perform well. Multiplicative combinations can effectively prioritize bins that satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. Adaptive weighting based on item size can improve robustness but requires careful tuning. Avoid overly complex scoring functions or unused library imports.\n\nDesigning effective heuristics involves balancing multiple objectives (e.g., tight fit, bin fullness). Additive combinations with nuanced terms (like logarithmic bonuses) offer more control than simple multiplication. Robustness to edge cases (like empty bins) and careful normalization are crucial for reliable performance.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
