**Analysis:**
Comparing (Heuristics 1st) vs (Heuristics 2nd), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 3rd) vs (Heuristics 4th), Heuristics 4th introduces a "Fill Level Bonus" and a more complex exploration strategy. The fill level bonus (penalizing large remaining capacities) in Heuristics 4th is a good addition for utilization. The exploration strategy in Heuristics 4th, while more complex, aims for a more nuanced exploration by adapting to the number of fitting bins, which is a step up.

Comparing (Heuristics 4th) vs (Heuristics 5th), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 5th) vs (Heuristics 6th), Heuristics 5th uses a simpler exploration (uniform boost to all fitting bins with probability). Heuristics 6th attempts a more sophisticated exploration by boosting bins closer to the mean exploitation score, aiming to explore "promising but not top" candidates. This seems more targeted than uniform boosting. Heuristics 6th also uses a weighted sum of tightness and utilization, which is a reasonable way to combine objectives.

Comparing (Heuristics 6th) vs (Heuristics 7th), Heuristics 7th is identical to Heuristics 5th. This indicates a lack of progression or differentiation in the provided list for these specific entries.

Comparing (Heuristics 7th) vs (Heuristics 8th), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 8th) vs (Heuristics 9th), Heuristics 8th has a complex exploration that scales randomly. Heuristics 9th uses a simple epsilon-greedy with a random pick for exploration. Heuristics 9th's combined score (tightness + 0.5 * utilization) is simpler than Heuristics 8th's multiplicative approach. The normalization in 9th is also simpler.

Comparing (Heuristics 9th) vs (Heuristics 10th), Heuristics 10th introduces a "Dynamic Epsilon-Greedy Exploration" and a more adaptive utilization score, attempting to boost scores of less utilized bins. This is more sophisticated than the simple epsilon-greedy in Heuristics 9th. Heuristics 10th's approach to combining scores and exploring seems more nuanced.

Comparing (Heuristics 10th) vs (Heuristics 11th), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 11th) vs (Heuristics 12th), Heuristics 11th uses a fixed exploration probability with a scaled random score favoring less utilized bins. Heuristics 12th uses a fixed `exploration_prob` to select a *number* of bins to boost uniformly. Heuristics 12th's combination of tightness and utilization seems more balanced with normalized utilization bonus. The exploration in 12th is simpler (uniform boost) but ensures at least one bin is explored if possible.

Comparing (Heuristics 12th) vs (Heuristics 13th), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 13th) vs (Heuristics 14th), Heuristics 14th has significantly different imports (random, math, scipy, torch) and unused parameters, indicating it's an incomplete or placeholder heuristic, making direct comparison difficult and marking it as worse due to lack of implementation and unnecessary complexity.

Comparing (Heuristics 14th) vs (Heuristics 15th), they are identical and incomplete.

Comparing (Heuristics 15th) vs (Heuristics 16th), they are identical and incomplete.

Comparing (Heuristics 16th) vs (Heuristics 17th), Heuristics 17th is a complete heuristic with a clear strategy, unlike the incomplete Heuristics 16th. Heuristics 17th has a multiplicative combination of tightness and utilization bonus, and its exploration boosts specific bins.

Comparing (Heuristics 17th) vs (Heuristics 18th), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 18th) vs (Heuristics 19th), they are identical.

Comparing (Heuristics 19th) vs (Heuristics 20th), they are identical.

Overall: Heuristics 1st-2nd and 5th-8th and 11th-13th and 17th-20th are largely identical and represent a solid base combining tightness, utilization bonus, and basic exploration. Heuristics 3rd and 4th/5th introduce more sophisticated utilization bonuses. Heuristics 6th tries a more advanced exploration. Heuristics 10th/11th attempt dynamic exploration. Heuristics 12th/13th offer a structured exploration boost. The most distinct and potentially improved approaches seem to be those in Heuristics 4th/5th (more nuanced utilization), 6th (smarter exploration targeting), and 10th/11th (dynamic exploration). However, due to extensive duplication, the progression is unclear. The latter group of identical heuristics (17th-20th) represents a reasonable, albeit unoriginal, approach. Heuristics 14th-16th are clearly worse due to incompleteness.

**Experience:**
Combine distinct objectives (like tightness and utilization) using weighted sums or multiplicative factors. Implement exploration strategies that go beyond simple random choice, like boosting less-explored or "average" options. Normalize intermediate scores to prevent dominance by one factor. Ensure robustness by handling edge cases (e.g., division by zero) and providing fallbacks.
