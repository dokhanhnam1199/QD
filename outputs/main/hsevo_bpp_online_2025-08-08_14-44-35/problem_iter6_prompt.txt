Design heuristics that explicitly address different facets of the problem, allowing for targeted improvements. Integrate mechanisms for systematic empirical testing and comparison against baselines.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on generic exploration strategies without understanding their impact on specific problem structures. Implementing overly complex or poorly understood scaling mechanisms before thoroughly validating simpler approaches.\n*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves deep understanding of the problem and tailored solutions. It's not about applying off-the-shelf meta-heuristics but about intelligently combining and adapting them based on empirical evidence and problem-specific insights.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
