Heuristic 4 solely focuses on tight packing (inverse of remaining capacity after packing). Heuristic 1's attempt to balance objectives is potentially better, but its implementation has an error in calculating `filled_ratio` and the subsequent logic might not achieve its stated goals effectively. Heuristic 4 is simpler and directly implements the \"tightest fit\" idea.\n\nComparing Heuristic 1 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 5 (priority_v2): Heuristic 5 introduces dynamic weighting based on item size relative to bin capacity, aiming to favor tight packing for small items and using fuller bins for larger items. This is a more sophisticated approach than Heuristic 1's fixed weights and static scores, but Heuristic 1's conceptual goal of balancing two factors is also valuable. Heuristic 5's complexity and dynamic weighting seem promising.\n\nComparing Heuristic 5 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 6 (priority_v2): Heuristic 5 uses item size relative to max capacity for dynamic weighting. Heuristic 6 uses item size relative to average remaining capacity for dynamic weighting of tight fit. Both try to adapt. Heuristic 5's inclusion of a \"future accommodation\" score alongside \"tight fit\" and \"nearly full\" is more comprehensive than Heuristic 6's simpler \"tight fit\" and \"nearly full\" components.\n\nComparing Heuristic 4 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 9 (priority_v2): These heuristics are identical, both implementing a simple \"tightest fit\" strategy (inverse remaining capacity after packing) and normalizing the results. They represent a baseline approach.\n\nComparing Heuristic 2 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 10 (priority_v2): Both introduce exploration. Heuristic 2 uses a small fixed probability to add a boost to a random subset of valid bins. Heuristic 10 uses an epsilon-greedy approach: with probability epsilon, it picks a random fitting bin; otherwise, it picks the best fit. Heuristic 10's epsilon-greedy is a more standard and potentially effective exploration strategy for optimizing decisions.\n\nComparing Heuristic 7 (priority_v2) vs Heuristics 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (all priority_v2): Heuristic 7 combines inverse gaps with a uniform boost to all suitable bins (soft epsilon-greedy). Heuristics 11-16 are very similar, implementing a tight fit (inverse of waste/gap) and some form of exploration. Heuristic 11 uses Gaussian noise based on std dev. Heuristics 12-16 use an epsilon-greedy approach where a random available bin gets a significantly boosted priority. Heuristic 10's epsilon-greedy (select random fitting bin vs best fit) seems more direct than boosting a bin's priority. The implementation in 12-16, boosting a single bin's priority, is a very crude form of exploration. Heuristic 11's noise approach is also interesting.\n\nComparing Heuristic 17 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 20 (priority_v2): Both prioritize tight fits and penalize empty bins. Heuristic 17 uses a fixed large penalty for empty bins. Heuristic 20 seems identical to 17. They focus on leveraging existing bins.\n\nComparing Heuristic 18 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 19 (priority_v2): These heuristics are identical. They attempt to balance tight packing, future accommodation, and adaptive utilization with weighted scores. This multi-objective approach is conceptually strong.\n\nOverall: The best heuristics (1, 5, 6, 18/19) attempt to balance multiple objectives (tight fit, nearly full, future accommodation, adaptive utilization). Heuristics 2, 10, 11, 12-16 introduce exploration mechanisms. Heuristic 10's epsilon-greedy is a strong contender. Heuristic 18/19's multi-objective approach is also very promising. The simplest but functional approach is the tight-fit strategy (4, 9). The worst heuristics are those with clear bugs or conceptually flawed logic (like the initial attempt in Heuristic 1). The identical heuristics (4 vs 9, 18 vs 19) suggest redundancy or copy-pasting errors in the prompt's ranking. The cluster of identical \"Inverse Distance + epsilon-greedy\" heuristics (12-16) are simple but not as nuanced as others.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective optimization, adaptive search, problem decomposition, empirical validation.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on clear objective articulation and breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems. Design heuristics that explicitly address different facets of the problem, allowing for targeted improvements. Integrate mechanisms for systematic empirical testing and comparison against baselines.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on generic exploration strategies without understanding their impact on specific problem structures. Implementing overly complex or poorly understood scaling mechanisms before thoroughly validating simpler approaches.\n*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves deep understanding of the problem and tailored solutions. It's not about applying off-the-shelf meta-heuristics but about intelligently combining and adapting them based on empirical evidence and problem-specific insights.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
