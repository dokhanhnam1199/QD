    Implements the Best Fit strategy for the online Bin Packing Problem.

    The priority is determined by how well an item fits into a bin.
    A higher priority is given to bins that have just enough space for the item,
    minimizing wasted space. Bins that cannot fit the item are assigned a
    very low priority (or effectively, zero priority in this context).

            # gets the highest priority, we can use a score inversely
            # proportional to the remaining space *after* placing the item.
            # A simple way to achieve this is to assign a score of 1 / (1 + diff)
            # where diff is remaining_cap - item.
            # To avoid division by zero or very small numbers if we simply used 1/diff,
            # we add 1 to the difference.
            # A bin that is a perfect fit (remaining_cap - item == 0) gets 1/1 = 1.
            # A bin that has just a little more space gets
