Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights:

*   **Keywords:** Performance, adaptability, interpretability, validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with clear objectives and simple combination mechanisms. Incorporate adaptive exploration and consider smooth, non-linear scaling for fine-tuning. Prioritize vectorized operations for efficiency.
*   **Avoid:** Ambiguity in objectives, overly complex components, and buggy implementations. Resist relying solely on linear or binary scaling without justification.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on making heuristics understandable and maintainable. This clarity aids in identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement through controlled experimentation and validation.
