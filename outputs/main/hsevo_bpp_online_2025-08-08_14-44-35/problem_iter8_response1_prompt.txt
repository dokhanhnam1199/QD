Heuristic 6's approach of normalizing and then applying weights and epsilon feels more complex and potentially less robust due to the normalization scaling.\n\nComparing Heuristic 7/8 (Epsilon-Greedy Best Fit, simple score) with Heuristic 12/13 (Epsilon-Greedy Best Fit, boosted random choice), Heuristics 12/13's approach of boosting the random choice's priority might make exploration too dominant, potentially hindering exploitation of good fits. Heuristics 7/8's direct use of normalized tight-fit scores in exploitation is cleaner.\n\nComparing Heuristic 9/10/11 (Multi-objective with adaptive utilization and boosted exploration) with Heuristic 18/19 (Multi-objective with adaptive weights based on available bins), Heuristics 18/19 have a more grounded adaptive weighting strategy based on bin availability, which is a better heuristic for adaptivity than the more generic \"boosted exploration\" in 9/10/11. However, the core objectives in 9/10/11 (tight fit + utilization) might be more generally applicable than the specific balancing in 18/19.\n\nComparing Heuristic 1 (simple epsilon-greedy Best Fit) with Heuristic 2/3/4/5 (complex combination of tight fit and \"penalty for empty bins\"), the latter heuristics attempt to incorporate more nuanced ideas like penalizing slack. However, their implementation is convoluted and the interpretation of \"penalty for empty bins\" is not clearly defined or consistently applied, leading to less straightforward logic. Heuristic 1's simplicity and clear strategy make it more robust.\n\nComparing Heuristic 20 (Worst Fit + Tightness bonus) with Heuristic 18/19 (adaptive multi-objective), Heuristic 20's approach is interesting but the combination of Worst Fit and Tightness bonus, along with the \"less used\" bonus, makes it complex and potentially contradictory in its goals. The adaptive weighting in 18/19 is a more coherent approach to balancing objectives.\n\nOverall, simpler heuristics that clearly define and combine strategies (like Heuristic 1) tend to be better than overly complex ones with ambiguously defined components (like 2-5, 18-20).\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Performance, adaptability, interpretability, validation.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with clear objectives and simple combination mechanisms. Incorporate adaptive exploration and consider smooth, non-linear scaling for fine-tuning. Prioritize vectorized operations for efficiency.\n*   **Avoid:** Ambiguity in objectives, overly complex components, and buggy implementations. Resist relying solely on linear or binary scaling without justification.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on making heuristics understandable and maintainable. This clarity aids in identifying bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement through controlled experimentation and validation.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
