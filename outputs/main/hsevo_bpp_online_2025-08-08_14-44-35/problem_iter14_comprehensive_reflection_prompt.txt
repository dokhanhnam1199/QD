{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nCombine distinct objectives (like tightness and utilization) using weighted sums or multiplicative factors. Implement exploration strategies that go beyond simple random choice, like boosting less-explored or \"average\" options. Normalize intermediate scores to prevent dominance by one factor. Ensure robustness by handling edge cases (e.g., division by zero) and providing fallbacks.\nBalance multiple objectives (e.g., tight fit, bin utilization) using weighted sums or dynamic weights. Incorporate adaptive exploration (epsilon-greedy, noise) to avoid local optima. Prioritize clarity and correctness; avoid buggy implementations. Simple \"tightest fit\" is a reasonable baseline.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize heuristics that balance precision (tightest fit) with robustness (handling non-fits, exploration). Vectorized operations (5, 8, 10) are preferred for efficiency. Consider meta-heuristics like epsilon-greedy (9) for enhanced performance through exploration. Smooth, non-linear scaling (1, 11, 14, 15, 16) can offer better fine-tuning than linear or binary approaches.\n\nSimplicity and clarity in heuristic design are paramount. Clearly defined objectives (e.g., tightest fit, exploration) and a straightforward combination mechanism (like weighted sums or direct selection) lead to more robust and understandable heuristics. Overly complex or ambiguously defined components can introduce unintended behaviors and reduce performance.\n\nPrioritize heuristics that combine multiple objective criteria (e.g., tightness and utilization). Use normalization to make scores comparable. Employ adaptive or blended exploration strategies over simple fixed probabilities for better balance between exploitation and discovery. Avoid overly simplistic scoring or exploration methods.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
