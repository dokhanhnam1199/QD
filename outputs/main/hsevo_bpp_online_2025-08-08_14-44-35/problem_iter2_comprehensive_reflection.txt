Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Exploration, Multi-objective Balancing, Dynamic Scaling, Algorithmic Synergy.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that dynamically adjust their exploration/exploitation balance based on observed performance and problem characteristics. Explore how to combine or nest heuristics (meta-heuristics) to leverage their complementary strengths.
*   **Avoid:** Rigid, one-size-fits-all parameter settings. Over-reliance on single-dimension optimization without considering broader search space dynamics.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves understanding *when* and *why* certain heuristic components perform well, enabling the design of more adaptive and robust strategies that can navigate complex search landscapes efficiently.
