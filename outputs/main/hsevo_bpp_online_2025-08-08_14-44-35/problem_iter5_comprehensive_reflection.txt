Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective optimization, adaptive search, problem decomposition, empirical validation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on clear objective articulation and breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems. Design heuristics that explicitly address different facets of the problem, allowing for targeted improvements. Integrate mechanisms for systematic empirical testing and comparison against baselines.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on generic exploration strategies without understanding their impact on specific problem structures. Implementing overly complex or poorly understood scaling mechanisms before thoroughly validating simpler approaches.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves deep understanding of the problem and tailored solutions. It's not about applying off-the-shelf meta-heuristics but about intelligently combining and adapting them based on empirical evidence and problem-specific insights.
