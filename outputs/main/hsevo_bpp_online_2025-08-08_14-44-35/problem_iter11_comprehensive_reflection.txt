Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, normalization, adaptive exploration, performance, clarity, robustness.
*   **Advice:** Focus on combining multiple, clearly defined objectives using robust methods like weighted sums or Pareto fronts. Implement adaptive exploration mechanisms (e.g., annealing, bandit-based) and ensure all components are well-tested for correctness.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear, or ad-hoc scoring functions without clear justification. Blindly prioritizing one objective without considering trade-offs. Bugs and unclear logic.
*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes a structured, evidence-based design process. By clearly defining objectives and using proven techniques for combining them and managing exploration, we build heuristics that are both effective and maintainable, avoiding the pitfalls of complexity and ambiguity.
