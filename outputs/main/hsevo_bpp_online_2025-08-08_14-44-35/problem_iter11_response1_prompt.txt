Heuristic 12 also combines Best Fit with epsilon-greedy but normalizes the tight-fit scores. Normalization (12) is generally better as it makes scores comparable and less dependent on absolute values, but Heuristic 1's exploration is a bit more nuanced (random choice of suitable bin vs. uniform priority). The ranking difference here is minimal, but 12's normalization might offer slightly more robust behavior.\n*   **Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 13/14/20:** Heuristics 13/14/20 introduce a \"nearness\" score based on exponential decay of the gap and adaptive exploration. This is more sophisticated than Heuristic 1's simple Best Fit. The dynamic exploration probability in 13/14/20 is also an improvement. The ranking of these depends on how well the \"nearness\" score and adaptive exploration perform in practice, but they represent a clear step up in complexity and potential effectiveness over Heuristic 1.\n*   **Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 19/20:** Heuristics 19 and 20 combine a modified Best Fit (using log for exploration and a composite score for exploitation) with dynamic exploration favoring less-utilized bins. This is more complex than Heuristic 1 and likely more effective due to the multi-faceted scoring and targeted exploration. The slight edge of 19/20 over 13/14 suggests a better combination of exploration and exploitation logic.\n*   **Heuristic 2/5/7/8/10 vs. Heuristic 11:** Heuristics 2, 5, 7, 8, and 10 are quite similar, combining tightness with a utilization bonus (often `1/(capacity + epsilon)`). Heuristic 11 refines this by using a more robust utilization score (`(max_remaining - current_remaining) / max_remaining`) and a blended epsilon-greedy approach (using random scores for exploration bins). This refined approach in Heuristic 11 is likely better, leading to its higher ranking compared to the earlier utilization heuristics.\n*   **Heuristic 4 vs. Heuristic 10:** Both combine tightness with a penalty for empty/large bins using inverse relationships with remaining capacity. Heuristic 10 uses a more direct inverse `1/(1 + penalty_weight * capacity)` whereas Heuristic 4 uses `1/(1 + penalty_weight * (capacity - item))`. The latter might be slightly more nuanced by considering the `item` size, but the difference is subtle. The ranking suggests 10 is slightly preferred.\n*   **Heuristic 9 vs. Heuristic 11:** Both combine tightness and utilization with adaptive exploration. Heuristic 9 has a dynamically adjusted `exploration_prob` based on bin count. Heuristic 11 uses a fixed `exploration_prob` but blends scores. Heuristic 11's blended score approach for exploration might be more stable and predictable than dynamically adjusting `exploration_prob`. However, the core scoring in 11 (more robust utilization, blending) is generally superior.\n*   **Heuristic 15/16/17/18 vs. Heuristic 11:** These heuristics are identical to each other and share the same core logic as Heuristic 11 but with a different exploration strategy (boosting random bins with a fixed priority). Heuristic 11's blended exploration might offer a smoother integration. The slight drop in ranking for 15-18 compared to 11 suggests the blending method in 11 is preferred over additive boosting of random bins.\n*   **Overall Trend:** Higher ranked heuristics tend to combine multiple scoring criteria (tightness, utilization), use more sophisticated normalization or blending for scores, and employ more refined exploration strategies (dynamic probability, score blending, or favoring less utilized bins for exploration). The simplest heuristics (like pure Best Fit or basic epsilon-greedy) are ranked lower.\n- \nHere's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, normalization, adaptive exploration, performance, clarity, robustness.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on combining multiple, clearly defined objectives using robust methods like weighted sums or Pareto fronts. Implement adaptive exploration mechanisms (e.g., annealing, bandit-based) and ensure all components are well-tested for correctness.\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, non-linear, or ad-hoc scoring functions without clear justification. Blindly prioritizing one objective without considering trade-offs. Bugs and unclear logic.\n*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes a structured, evidence-based design process. By clearly defining objectives and using proven techniques for combining them and managing exploration, we build heuristics that are both effective and maintainable, avoiding the pitfalls of complexity and ambiguity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
