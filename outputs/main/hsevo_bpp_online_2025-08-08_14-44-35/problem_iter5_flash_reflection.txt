**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 4 (priority_v2): Heuristic 1 attempts a more nuanced approach by considering both tight packing and current fullness, aiming for a balance. Heuristic 4 solely focuses on tight packing (inverse of remaining capacity after packing). Heuristic 1's attempt to balance objectives is potentially better, but its implementation has an error in calculating `filled_ratio` and the subsequent logic might not achieve its stated goals effectively. Heuristic 4 is simpler and directly implements the "tightest fit" idea.

Comparing Heuristic 1 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 5 (priority_v2): Heuristic 5 introduces dynamic weighting based on item size relative to bin capacity, aiming to favor tight packing for small items and using fuller bins for larger items. This is a more sophisticated approach than Heuristic 1's fixed weights and static scores, but Heuristic 1's conceptual goal of balancing two factors is also valuable. Heuristic 5's complexity and dynamic weighting seem promising.

Comparing Heuristic 5 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 6 (priority_v2): Heuristic 5 uses item size relative to max capacity for dynamic weighting. Heuristic 6 uses item size relative to average remaining capacity for dynamic weighting of tight fit. Both try to adapt. Heuristic 5's inclusion of a "future accommodation" score alongside "tight fit" and "nearly full" is more comprehensive than Heuristic 6's simpler "tight fit" and "nearly full" components.

Comparing Heuristic 4 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 9 (priority_v2): These heuristics are identical, both implementing a simple "tightest fit" strategy (inverse remaining capacity after packing) and normalizing the results. They represent a baseline approach.

Comparing Heuristic 2 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 10 (priority_v2): Both introduce exploration. Heuristic 2 uses a small fixed probability to add a boost to a random subset of valid bins. Heuristic 10 uses an epsilon-greedy approach: with probability epsilon, it picks a random fitting bin; otherwise, it picks the best fit. Heuristic 10's epsilon-greedy is a more standard and potentially effective exploration strategy for optimizing decisions.

Comparing Heuristic 7 (priority_v2) vs Heuristics 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (all priority_v2): Heuristic 7 combines inverse gaps with a uniform boost to all suitable bins (soft epsilon-greedy). Heuristics 11-16 are very similar, implementing a tight fit (inverse of waste/gap) and some form of exploration. Heuristic 11 uses Gaussian noise based on std dev. Heuristics 12-16 use an epsilon-greedy approach where a random available bin gets a significantly boosted priority. Heuristic 10's epsilon-greedy (select random fitting bin vs best fit) seems more direct than boosting a bin's priority. The implementation in 12-16, boosting a single bin's priority, is a very crude form of exploration. Heuristic 11's noise approach is also interesting.

Comparing Heuristic 17 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 20 (priority_v2): Both prioritize tight fits and penalize empty bins. Heuristic 17 uses a fixed large penalty for empty bins. Heuristic 20 seems identical to 17. They focus on leveraging existing bins.

Comparing Heuristic 18 (priority_v2) vs Heuristic 19 (priority_v2): These heuristics are identical. They attempt to balance tight packing, future accommodation, and adaptive utilization with weighted scores. This multi-objective approach is conceptually strong.

Overall: The best heuristics (1, 5, 6, 18/19) attempt to balance multiple objectives (tight fit, nearly full, future accommodation, adaptive utilization). Heuristics 2, 10, 11, 12-16 introduce exploration mechanisms. Heuristic 10's epsilon-greedy is a strong contender. Heuristic 18/19's multi-objective approach is also very promising. The simplest but functional approach is the tight-fit strategy (4, 9). The worst heuristics are those with clear bugs or conceptually flawed logic (like the initial attempt in Heuristic 1). The identical heuristics (4 vs 9, 18 vs 19) suggest redundancy or copy-pasting errors in the prompt's ranking. The cluster of identical "Inverse Distance + epsilon-greedy" heuristics (12-16) are simple but not as nuanced as others.

**Experience:**
Balance multiple objectives (e.g., tight fit, bin utilization) using weighted sums or dynamic weights. Incorporate adaptive exploration (epsilon-greedy, noise) to avoid local optima. Prioritize clarity and correctness; avoid buggy implementations. Simple "tightest fit" is a reasonable baseline.
