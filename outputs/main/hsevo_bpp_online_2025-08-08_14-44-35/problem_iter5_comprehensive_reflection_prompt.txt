{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nBalance multiple objectives (e.g., tight fit, bin utilization) using weighted sums or dynamic weights. Incorporate adaptive exploration (epsilon-greedy, noise) to avoid local optima. Prioritize clarity and correctness; avoid buggy implementations. Simple \"tightest fit\" is a reasonable baseline.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize heuristics that balance precision (tightest fit) with robustness (handling non-fits, exploration). Vectorized operations (5, 8, 10) are preferred for efficiency. Consider meta-heuristics like epsilon-greedy (9) for enhanced performance through exploration. Smooth, non-linear scaling (1, 11, 14, 15, 16) can offer better fine-tuning than linear or binary approaches.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
