**Analysis:**
Comparing heuristic 1 (Softmax-Based Fit) with heuristic 2 (Inverse Remaining Capacity, exact fit priority), heuristic 1 offers a more nuanced prioritization by converting differences into probabilities, allowing for a smoother selection and potential exploration. Heuristic 2 rigidly assigns 1.0 or 1.0 / (difference + epsilon), which can lead to abrupt shifts in priority.

Comparing heuristic 3 (Almost Full Fit with penalty) with heuristic 4 (identical to 2), heuristic 3 introduces a penalty for empty bins which might not always be desirable. Heuristic 2 focuses solely on minimizing remaining capacity after fitting.

Comparing heuristic 5 (Inverse Remaining Capacity, vectorized) and heuristic 6 (Inverse Remaining Capacity, looped) with heuristic 7 (identical to 6), heuristics 5, 6, and 7 all implement the inverse remaining capacity strategy. Heuristic 5 is more performant due to vectorization. Heuristic 8 is identical to 6 and 7.

Comparing heuristic 9 (Epsilon-Greedy with Best Fit) with heuristic 10 (Inverse Distance, vectorized) and heuristic 11 (Sigmoid Fit Ratio), heuristic 9 introduces exploration via epsilon-greedy, which is a powerful meta-heuristic. Heuristic 10 is a standard inverse distance approach. Heuristic 11 uses a sigmoid on fit ratios, which can be sensitive to scaling.

Comparing heuristic 12 and 13 (First Fit with boosted priority) with heuristic 14 and 15 (Sigmoid on gaps), heuristics 12 and 13 artificially boost the priority of the *first* fit, which is not always optimal and might miss better fits later in the list. Heuristics 14 and 15 use a sigmoid on the gap, offering a smoother prioritization than a simple binary or boosted value.

Comparing heuristic 16 (Sigmoid on fit ratios, shifted) with heuristic 17 (Proportional Remaining Capacity) and heuristic 18 (Difference as priority, negative infinity for no fit), heuristic 16 uses a sigmoid on fit ratios, similar to 11 but with a different shift. Heuristic 17 prioritizes bins based on the proportion of remaining capacity, which might not best capture the "tightest" fit. Heuristic 18 directly uses the difference, with a strong penalty for non-fits, which is a simple but effective approach.

Comparing heuristic 19 and 20 (Difference with random noise) with heuristic 18, heuristics 19 and 20 add Gaussian noise to the difference, aiming for exploration. However, adding noise to the *difference* can make suboptimal choices more likely, and the magnitude of the noise is data-dependent. Heuristic 18's clear prioritization of minimum difference is more direct.

Overall: Softmax-based (1) and those using inverse remaining capacity (5, 6, 7, 8, 10) generally provide good prioritization by favoring tighter fits. Epsilon-greedy (9) adds a valuable exploration component. Sigmoid-based approaches (11, 14, 15, 16) offer tunable sensitivities but can be complex. Artificial boosting (12, 13) is less robust. Pure difference (18) is simple and effective. Noise addition (19, 20) can be unpredictable.

**Experience:**
Prioritize heuristics that balance precision (tightest fit) with robustness (handling non-fits, exploration). Vectorized operations (5, 8, 10) are preferred for efficiency. Consider meta-heuristics like epsilon-greedy (9) for enhanced performance through exploration. Smooth, non-linear scaling (1, 11, 14, 15, 16) can offer better fine-tuning than linear or binary approaches.
