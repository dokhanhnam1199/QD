Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Normalization, Adaptive Exploration, Robustness.
*   **Advice:** Focus on designing heuristics that explicitly manage trade-offs between competing objectives using techniques like normalized weighted sums or Pareto-based selection. Implement sophisticated exploration strategies that dynamically adjust based on search progress, such as Thompson sampling or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).
*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining objectives with fixed weights that might not generalize. Using brittle or ad-hoc handling of edge cases without a clear fallback strategy. Over-reliance on simple epsilon-greedy for exploration, which can be inefficient.
*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes principled methods for handling multi-objective optimization and exploration, ensuring heuristics are adaptable, less prone to local optima, and better at managing complexity without becoming overly brittle.
