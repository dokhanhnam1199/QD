def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to encourage the packing of items into bins 
    where the item size is close to the remaining capacity, thereby minimizing waste 
    and reducing the number of bins needed.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the waste that would be generated by adding the item to each bin
    waste = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    #_MASK describes valid bins 
    mask = waste >= 0
    
    # Assign high priority to valid bins with lower waste
    priority = np.where(mask, -waste, -np.inf)
