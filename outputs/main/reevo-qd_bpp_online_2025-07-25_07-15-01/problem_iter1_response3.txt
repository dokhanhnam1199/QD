    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to favor bins that have just enough capacity to 
    hold the item. It avoids overfilling bins and minimizes waste.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
