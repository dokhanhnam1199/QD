def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size.
    If a bin has just enough capacity to hold the item, it gets the highest priority.
    Bins with less capacity than the item get zero priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # First, calculate the ratio of remaining capacity to item size

    # Give higher priority to bins with ratio close to 1
    scores = np.where(ratios > 0, 1 / ratios, 0)
