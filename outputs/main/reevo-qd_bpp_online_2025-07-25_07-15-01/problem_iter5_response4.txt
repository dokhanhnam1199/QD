    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function simplifies and prioritizes ratios, near-full bins, 
    and penalizes extremes. It balances calculations and combines key factors 
    for more effective heuristics.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
