    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size.
    It strikes a balance between simplicity, penalties, and bonuses to optimize online BPP heuristics.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.

    Return:
