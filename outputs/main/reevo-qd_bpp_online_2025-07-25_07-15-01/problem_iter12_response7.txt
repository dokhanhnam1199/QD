    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size.
    It simplifies and balances ratio calculations, prioritizing near-full bins and penalizing extremes.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
