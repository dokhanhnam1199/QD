    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins with the least remaining capacity that can still accommodate the item.
    It incentivizes filling up bins that are already almost full, while avoiding overflowing bins.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    sufficient_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # Assign high priority to bins with just enough capacity
    priority = np.where(sufficient_bins, 1 / (bins_remain_cap + item), 0)
