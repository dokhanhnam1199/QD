Simplify priority calculations and directly normalize relevant values to improve the heuristic's effectiveness and computational efficiency.
Simpler priority functions can be more effective; focus on relative order rather than absolute values or complex transformations.
Simplify transformations and normalization ranges by using `np.power` and `np.isfinite` to improve heuristic performance.
Simplify transformations and directly normalize relevant metrics to design better heuristics.
To design better heuristics, simplify and refine priority calculations, and normalize scores to ensure comparability across bins.
Simplify priority functions, focus on key factors, and normalize scores to improve heuristic performance and readability.
Use non-linear transformations and normalization to create effective priority functions for online bin packing problems.
Use non-linear transformations and normalization to amplify differences in priorities and improve heuristic performance.
Simplify calculations and avoid normalization; use non-linear transformations to directly influence priority scores effectively.
Simplify and directly normalize relevant metrics, avoiding unnecessary transformations to design more effective heuristics.
