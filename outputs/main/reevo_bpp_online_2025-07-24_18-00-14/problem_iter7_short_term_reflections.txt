Non-linear transformations and normalization can improve heuristics by better distinguishing between similar and dissimilar solutions.
Use relative remaining capacity and non-linear transformations to encourage tighter packing, and simplify normalization steps.
Divide priority calculation into smaller, meaningful steps, and judiciously apply normalization and non-linear transformations.
Non-linear transformations and normalization can improve heuristics. Using relative values and penalizing less tight bins can be beneficial.
To design better heuristics, apply non-linear transformations, normalize scores, and incorporate relative metrics to guide the optimization.
To design better heuristics, consider normalization and tight packing strategies as shown in the better code version.
Normalize priority scores and encourage tight packing by mapping remaining capacities to a comparable range.
Balance exploration and exploitation by normalizing and transforming priority scores, and consider relative remaining capacity.
Normalize after non-linear transformation and use relative remaining capacity to improve heuristic design for online bin packing.
Design better heuristics by analyzing problem characteristics, simplifying calculations, and applying suitable transformations.
