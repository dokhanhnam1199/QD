To design better heuristics, consider non-linear transformations and encourage tight packing by minimizing remaining capacity.
Design better heuristics by applying non-linear transformations and normalizing priority scores to amplify differences and improve comparability.
Simplify priority functions and directly relate them to the problem objective to design more effective heuristics.
Non-linear transformations and normalization can improve heuristics by amplifying differences and adapting to varying scales.
Use a meaningful scoring metric, like remaining capacity ratio, to guide the packing decision, rather than absolute remaining capacity.
Non-linear transformations and amplifying differences can improve heuristics. Consider applying non-linear functions to priority scores.
Favor tighter packing by minimizing remaining capacity and normalizing priorities within valid bin ranges for better heuristic performance.
Use non-linear transformations and relative measures to encourage desired behavior, like tight packing in bin packing problems.
Use meaningful base priority scores and non-linear transformations to amplify differences, and normalize priorities for comparable ranges.
Use non-linear transformations and normalization to amplify differences and ensure comparable priority ranges for better heuristic design.
