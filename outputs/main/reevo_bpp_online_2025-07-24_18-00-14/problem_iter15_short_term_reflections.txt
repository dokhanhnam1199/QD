Favor simplicity and directness; use remaining capacity after packing to guide bin selection for better performance.
Use relative remaining capacity and normalize valid priorities to improve heuristic performance in online bin packing problems.
Favor simplicity and directness; use remaining capacity after packing as a straightforward priority metric for valid bins.
Favor simplicity and directness; use meaningful priorities like remaining capacity after packing, and normalize them for better differentiation.
Tightness of fit and proper normalization are key. Prioritize bins that fit items snugly to minimize waste space.
Focus on post-addition bin state and relative capacity changes to design more effective heuristics for online bin packing problems.
Use relative remaining capacity and normalize valid priorities to improve heuristic performance in online bin packing problems.
Favor simplicity and directness; use meaningful, problem-related metrics for prioritization, like remaining capacity after item placement.
Design heuristics that directly target the goal, simplicity is key, and avoid unnecessary complex transformations.
Focus on relative remaining capacity and apply non-linear transformations to guide bin selection effectively.
