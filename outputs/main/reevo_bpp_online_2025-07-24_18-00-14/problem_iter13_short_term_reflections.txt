Use meaningful transformations, like ratios, and suitable non-linear functions to amplify differences and improve heuristic performance.
Use meaningful transformations and intuitive metrics, like remaining capacity after addition, to design more effective priority functions.
Non-linear transformations can significantly impact performance; try exponential decay instead of tanh to prioritize tighter fits.
Prefer simple, interpretable priority functions and consider the problem's specific requirements when designing non-linear transformations.
Use meaningful transformations and avoid unnecessary computations; consider the problem's context when designing priority functions.
Use meaningful normalization and non-linear transformations to amplify differences and consider relative remaining capacity.
Normalize after non-linear transformation and use relative remaining capacity to improve heuristic design for online bin packing.
Design better heuristics by normalizing scores and using meaningful metrics, like remaining capacity, to guide the optimization.
Focus on simplicity and directly optimizing the objective; avoid unnecessary transformations and normalize relevant priorities.
Use negative remaining capacity and exponential transformation to prioritize bins that fit items tightly.
