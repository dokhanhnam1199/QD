To design better heuristics for online Bin Packing, normalize scores, apply non-linear transformations, and use relative metrics. Simplify priority calculations and encourage tight packing by leveraging problem structure and relative remaining capacity. Balance exploration and exploitation through nuanced scoring and normalization.
