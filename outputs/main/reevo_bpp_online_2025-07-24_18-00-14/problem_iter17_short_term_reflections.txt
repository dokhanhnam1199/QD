Use relative remaining capacity and exponential transformation to better differentiate bin priorities and improve packing efficiency.
Use relative remaining capacity and normalize scores. Apply non-linear transformations like exp to prioritize bins more effectively.
Normalize and adapt priority scores to problem specifics, and consider tighter packing by leveraging remaining capacities.
Normalize and invert remaining capacity ratios to prioritize tighter packing, and distinguish between valid and invalid bins.
Normalize scores to a common range and use relative remaining capacity to encourage tight packing.
Design better heuristics by understanding the problem's objective and adapting scoring functions to encourage desired packing behavior.
Use relative measures and non-linear transformations to create more informative priority scores, enabling better differentiation between bins.
Normalization and tweaking priority scores can significantly improve heuristics, as seen in the better code's tighter packing strategy.
Use relative measures and non-linear transformations, like exponential functions, to design more effective priority functions for heuristics.
Normalize priority scores and use relative remaining capacity to encourage tight packing and better bin utilization.
