```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Return a priority array for each bin following the Worst‑Fit strategy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    item : float
        Size of the item to be inserted.
    bins_remain_cap : np.ndarray
        Remaining capacities for each bin. Expected to be non‑negative numeric values.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Array of scores with the same shape as ``bins_remain_cap``. The bin with
        the maximum score will be chosen. Bins that cannot hold the item are
        assigned a priority of -∞, effectively removing them from consideration.

    Notes
    -----
    The priority is simply the amount of space that will remain after the
    item is placed in each bin. The index with the largest residual space
    gets the highest priority – the hallmark of the Worst‑Fit heuristic.
    """
    # Convert to float to avoid integer overflow/underflow when subtracting
    remain = bins_remain_cap.astype(float, copy=False) - item
    # Bins that can't accept the item get -infinity priority
    return np.where(remain >= 0, remain, -np.inf)
