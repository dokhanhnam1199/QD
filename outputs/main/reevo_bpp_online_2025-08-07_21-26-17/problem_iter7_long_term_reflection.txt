Score feasible bins via weighted sum of normalized leftover, fit ratio, and usage; apply a variance‑adapted sigmoid to each term, multiply scores, add a huge exact‑fit bonus, and assign –∞ to infeasibles. Use ε‑greedy (ε≈0.01) with deterministic tie‑break, vectorize, pre‑compute feasibility masks, and tune alphas offline.
