Use normalized leftover with a tunable sigmoid, penalize infeasible bins, and adjust steepness per data.
Minimize leftover, reward near‑zero waste heavily, heavily penalize infeasible bins, avoid stochastic noise.
Combine multiple sigmoid‑based criteria, multiply them, tune parameters, and inject exploration noise.
Prefer deterministic, fit‑aware scores; use smooth monotonic functions; penalize waste; vectorize; treat infeasible bins as minimal priority.
Score bins by smooth sigmoid of fit‑ratio and waste, combine multiplicatively, tune parameters, respect feasibility.
Use exact‑fit first, then best‑fit, dynamic epsilon, noise, penalize reuse.
Weight by negative leftover, adjust temperature, combine fit and waste, forecast next item size, balance bin occupancy.
Blend greedy leftover minimization with softmax temperature, add tie‑breaking randomness, consider fit ratios, and track expected bin usage.
Blend index ordering with residual capacity; weight feasibility, add tiny tie‑breakers, and adjust thresholds as load changes.
Score bins by negative leftover, apply softmax, avoid randomness, consider future items, balance load across bins.
