Multiplicative sigmoid scores, add noise, ε‑greedy, scale by capacity; prioritize tight fit, low waste, balanced usage.
Blend tight‑fit inverse leftover with adaptive epsilon; keep calculations cheap; use variance to tune exploration.
Use few well‑tuned sigmoid components, static capacity estimate, vectorized ops, low epsilon, avoid softmax, assign -inf to infeasibles.
Simplify priority: inverse leftover, epsilon‑greedy randomness, drop softmax, avoid forecast, prune infeasible bins, test linear combos.
Balance leftover, fit ratio, variance; use temperature‑scaled softmax; exclude infeasible bins; tune weights; add controlled noise.
Blend normalized fit, waste, and usage scores; adapt sigmoid steepness; add noise and ε‑greedy; deterministic tie‑breaking.
Blend tight-fit bias with adaptive epsilon, scale exact‑fit bonuses, penalize waste, and consider limited lookahead.
Weight fit, waste, and reuse signals; tune sigmoid thresholds; add random noise; use ε‑greedy exploration; estimate bin capacity adaptively.
Cache capacity, pre‑compute feasibility mask, vectorize sigmoid calculations, minimize noise, limit ε‑greedy, handle edge cases early.
Simplify: combine leftover, fit ratio, variance; linear weighted sum; temperature‑scaled softmax; avoid arbitrary bonuses, forecasts, and ε‑greedy randomness.
