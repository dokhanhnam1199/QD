To design better heuristics, normalize priorities and noise to a common range and scale noise relative to priorities.
Normalize priorities before adding noise and use relative remaining capacity to improve heuristic performance and exploration.
Normalize priorities and noise to a common range and control exploration with a tunable parameter for better performance.
To design better heuristics, normalize both priorities and noise, and scale noise relative to priorities using a tunable parameter.
Normalize priorities before adding noise and directly modify valid bin priorities for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Normalize priorities and exploration noise, then re-normalize after combination to maintain a consistent priority scale.
To design better heuristics, simplify calculations, directly normalize priorities, and balance exploration-exploitation trade-offs.
Normalize priorities and noise to a common range and control exploration-exploitation trade-off using a tunable parameter.
Simplify exploration by directly adding scaled noise to valid bins, avoiding unnecessary clipping and normalization adjustments.
Normalize priorities within valid bins and scale noise by valid bin indicator for effective exploration.
