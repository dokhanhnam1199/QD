Simpler priority calculations and noise ranges can improve heuristics. Avoid unnecessary normalization unless it adds significant value.
To design better heuristics, simplify the priority function and directly reward desired bin characteristics.
Simplify the priority function by removing normalization and directly using remaining capacity after item addition.
Avoid unnecessary normalization, directly inject controlled noise, and scale it to balance exploitation and exploration.
Avoid normalization when possible, and directly scale exploration noise to maintain priority order and reduce computational overhead.
Simplify priority functions, directly use negative remaining capacity, and scale noise to enhance exploration-exploitation balance.
Controlled randomness and avoiding normalization can improve heuristics by maintaining meaningful score differences and enhancing exploration.
Normalizing priorities and using relative remaining capacity enhances the heuristic's effectiveness in online bin packing problems.
Simplify priority normalization and balance between fit score and randomness using a weighted sum for better performance.
Normalization of priorities and relative scoring can significantly improve heuristic performance by enhancing discriminability among valid bins.
