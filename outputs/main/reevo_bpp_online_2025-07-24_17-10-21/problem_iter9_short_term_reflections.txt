Simplify the priority function, reduce unnecessary operations, and use smaller noise for exploration to improve performance.
Simpler priority functions can be more effective; removing normalization and using negative remaining capacity helps.
Simpler priority functions can be more effective; avoid unnecessary normalization and use small, controlled randomness for exploration.
Simplify your priority function and directly optimize for the objective by using the remaining capacity after addition.
Simplify calculations, directly use normalized scores, and add small noise for exploration to design better heuristics.
Simpler calculations and less normalization improve performance; avoid unnecessary computations and directly use relevant values.
Simplify the priority function, use fewer operations, and maintain a balance between exploitation and exploration.
Simplify priority functions, focus on key factors like remaining capacity, and use minimal noise for exploration.
Use meaningful components like "least remaining capacity" instead of random noise for better heuristic design in online bin packing.
Simplify the priority function, reduce unnecessary computations, and adjust noise scale for better exploration-exploitation trade-off.
