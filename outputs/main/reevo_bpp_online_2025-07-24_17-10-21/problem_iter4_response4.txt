    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    
    This function implements a priority function that considers both the remaining capacity of the bins and the size of the item.
    It assigns higher priority to bins that have just enough capacity to hold the item, normalizes the priority scores, and adds a random noise for exploration.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
