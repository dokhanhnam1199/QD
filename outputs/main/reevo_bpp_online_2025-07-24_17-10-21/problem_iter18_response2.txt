    This function implements a simplified priority function with controlled randomness for exploration.
    It prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity to hold the item and introduces tunable randomness.
    
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.
        alpha: Parameter controlling the level of exploration. Defaults to 0.1.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
