def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, alpha: float = 0.9) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements a priority function that considers both the remaining capacity of the bins and the size of the item.
    It assigns higher priority to bins that have just enough capacity to hold the item, normalizes the priority scores, and adds a small random noise.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        alpha: Parameter controlling the trade-off between "fit" score and randomness.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # For valid bins, prioritize those with the least remaining capacity after addition
