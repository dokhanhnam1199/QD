To design better heuristics for online Bin Packing Problem, prioritize simplicity, exploit problem structure, and use meaningful priority functions with normalization. Balance exploration and exploitation, and consider remaining capacity and "fit" in priority functions. Handle edge cases properly to improve performance.
