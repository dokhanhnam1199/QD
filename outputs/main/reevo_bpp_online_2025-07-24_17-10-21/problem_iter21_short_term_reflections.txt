Simplify priority normalization and scale exploration noise properly using a tunable parameter for better heuristic performance.
Normalization and controlled noise improve heuristics; consider parameter tuning and adaptive noise for further optimization.
To design better heuristics, simplify the priority function and introduce controlled randomness relative to the problem scale.
Scaling noise by maximum remaining capacity instead of priority range provides a more consistent exploration strategy.
Scaling noise relative to a tunable parameter (`alpha`) improves balance between exploration and exploitation.
To design better heuristics, normalize scores carefully and scale noise appropriately to avoid overshadowing priority scores.
Normalize both priorities and noise, and introduce a parameter to control exploration level for better heuristic design.
Normalize both priorities and noise to a consistent range and use a controllable exploration parameter for better performance.
Simplify the normalization step and directly add scaled noise to valid bins to improve performance.
Normalize priorities and noise to a common range and introduce a tunable parameter to control exploration-exploitation trade-off.
