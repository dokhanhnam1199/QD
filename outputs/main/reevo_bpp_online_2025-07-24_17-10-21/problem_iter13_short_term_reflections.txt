Simplify the priority function, reduce unnecessary computations, and adjust noise scale to balance exploitation and exploration.
Prioritize bins with just enough capacity and balance "fit" scores with controlled randomness for better online BPP performance.
Prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after item addition, not before, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.
Prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after item addition and balance exploration with controlled noise.
Prioritize bins based on remaining capacity after item addition, not before, for better packing efficiency.
Decompose the priority function into multiple scores, normalize them, and combine using weighted sums for better performance.
To design better heuristics, simplify the priority function and reduce unnecessary normalization and parameter tuning.
Simplify priority functions, directly use meaningful values, and adjust noise scales for better exploitation-exploration trade-offs.
To design better heuristics, align priority functions with the problem's objective and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.
Normalize scores, balance exploitation and exploration, and adapt noise scaling to enhance heuristic performance in online bin packing.
