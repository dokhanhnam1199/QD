    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item, have the least remaining capacity after addition,
    and balances between exploitation and exploration.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.
        alpha: Parameter controlling the trade-off between "fit" score and random noise.
