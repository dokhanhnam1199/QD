    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function implements a priority function that considers both the remaining capacity of the bins and the size of the item.
    It assigns higher priority to bins that have just enough capacity to hold the item, with controlled randomness for exploration.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.
        alpha: Parameter controlling the trade-off between "fit" score and random noise.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
