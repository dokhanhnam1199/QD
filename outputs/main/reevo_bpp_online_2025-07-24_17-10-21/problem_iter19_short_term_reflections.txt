Use the remaining capacity after adding the item and introduce controlled randomness for better exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Use meaningful score differences, scale noise relative to priority range, and prioritize based on post-addition remaining capacity.
Simplify the priority function and introduce controlled randomness with a tunable parameter for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Use relative scoring, normalize priorities, and apply transformations to enhance discriminability among valid bins for better heuristics.
Tune noise scaling and priority calculation to balance exploitation and exploration for better heuristic performance in online BPP.
Normalizing priorities and scaling noise properly can significantly improve the performance of online bin packing heuristics.
Normalizing priorities and scaling noise properly can improve performance, and consider using relative values.
Use meaningful calculations like "remaining capacity after addition" and scale exploration noise for better balance.
Reward bins closest to being full and can fit the item, and add controlled noise for exploration.
Normalize priorities and scale noise effectively to balance exploitation and exploration for better heuristic performance.
