Design better heuristics by considering multiple factors, normalizing scores, and adding noise for exploration-exploitation balance.
To design better heuristics, balance exploitation and exploration, and consider normalization and noise injection techniques.
Simplify the scoring function and focus on the core objective: minimizing remaining capacity after addition.
Simplify priority functions, avoid complex parameter tuning, and consider normalization and noise injection for better performance.
To design better heuristics, consider balancing exploitation and exploration, and normalize scores for better decision-making.
Simpler, more interpretable scoring and normalization can improve heuristics; adding noise can enhance exploration.
Prioritize bins with just enough capacity, normalize scores, and add noise to balance exploitation and exploration.
Simplicity and directness often lead to better heuristics; avoid unnecessary complexity and parameters when possible.
Simplify the priority function and directly relate it to the problem's objective, like minimizing remaining capacity.
To design better heuristics, consider introducing tie-breakers and favoring bins with the least remaining capacity.
