Normalize both priority and noise to a common range and introduce a tunable parameter to control exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Scale priorities to avoid extreme values and add noise relative to the priority range for better exploration.
Smaller relative noise and clipping to valid range improves stability, and handling edge cases enhances performance.
To design better heuristics, normalize priorities and noise to a common range and control noise scale effectively.
Normalization and noise scaling are crucial. Normalizing priorities and noise to the same range improves heuristic performance.
Normalize scores for valid bins, add controlled noise, and re-normalize to maintain desired range for better heuristic performance.
Simplify the noise introduction by using a fixed scale and removing adaptive scaling for better performance.
Blend exploration and exploitation by mixing noise into priorities, then adjust the trade-off using a tunable parameter.
Scale noise relative to valid bin priorities and directly add it to valid bins for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Scale priorities to a suitable range and introduce relative noise for better exploration and avoiding extreme values.
