Simplifying the priority function and adjusting noise scale can improve performance. Consider the trade-off between exploitation and exploration.
Simplify the priority function by directly utilizing the normalized remaining capacity and minimizing unnecessary computations.
Simplifying calculations and scaling noise properly can improve heuristic performance, as shown in the better code version.
Simplify the priority function, reduce exploration noise magnitude, and avoid unnecessary normalization steps for better heuristic design.
Simplify scoring, directly use remaining capacity after addition, and introduce minimal random noise for better exploration-exploitation balance.
Simplify calculations, normalize scores properly, and tune noise scale to balance exploitation and exploration for better heuristics.
Simplify calculations, directly prioritize bins with least remaining capacity after addition, and use small noise for exploration.
Simplify priority functions, reduce unnecessary computations, and directly incorporate exploration noise for better performance.
