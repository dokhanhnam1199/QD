```python
def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins with the least remaining capacity that can still accommodate the item.
    It simplifies the calculation by focusing only on feasible solutions.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Find bins that can accommodate the item and assign priority based on remaining capacity
    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    
    return priorities
