```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins that have the least amount of remaining capacity compared to the item size,
    maximizing the chance of filling the bin to capacity. If multiple bins have the same difference, the bin with the 
    most remaining capacity is chosen.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # calculate the difference between the remaining capacity and the item size
    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
    
    # calculate the priority score, with bins having the smallest difference and largest remaining capacity getting higher scores
    priority = diff * -1 + bins_remain_cap
    
    return priority
