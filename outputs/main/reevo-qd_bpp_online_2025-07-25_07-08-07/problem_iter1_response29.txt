```python

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity to pack the item,
    minimizing waste of space. If no such bin exists, it prioritizes bins with the least remaining capacity,
    encouraging efficient use of space.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the item size and the remaining capacity of each bin
    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
    
    # Calculate the priority score based on the difference and remaining capacity
    priority = 1 / (diff + 1) + bins_remain_cap / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 1)
    
    return priority
