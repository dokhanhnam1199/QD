```python

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function prioritizes bins based on the ratio of the remaining capacity and the item size.
    If a bin has a higher remaining capacity compared to the item size, it gets a higher priority.
    Additionally, bins with lower remaining capacities are prioritized over those with higher remaining capacities,
    to ensure that bins are fully utilized.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
