Combine multiple scores, consider utilization and fit.
Prioritize tight packing and favor bins with more remaining capacity.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize remaining capacity.
Combine multiple scoring metrics for better heuristics.
Combine multiple factors with adjustable weights.
Combine fit and capacity scores with adjustable weights.
Focus on minimizing waste ratio for better heuristics.
Prioritize valid bins with least remaining capacity.
Prioritize bins with least remaining capacity.
Use ratios instead of absolute values for priority calculations.
