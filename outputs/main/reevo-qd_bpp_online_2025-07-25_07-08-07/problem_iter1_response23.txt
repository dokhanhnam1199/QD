    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity to accommodate the item.
    It gives a higher priority to bins with more remaining capacity, but penalizes bins that are almost full or would be overfilled.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
