Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Implement rigorous evaluation metrics beyond immediate fit. Introduce controlled randomness strategically. Prioritize feasibility maintenance.\n*   **Avoid:** Rigid, static strategies; solely focusing on initial performance; uncontrolled randomness; ignoring constraints early.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics blend adaptability with robust evaluation, mitigating premature convergence and proactively managing feasibility. Controlled diversification helps explore the solution space without sacrificing solution quality entirely.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
