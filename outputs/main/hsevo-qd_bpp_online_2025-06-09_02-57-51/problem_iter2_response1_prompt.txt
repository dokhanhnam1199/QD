The worst heuristic only uses a simplified calculation of bin fullness and does not include these advanced features.\n\nComparing (13th) vs (20th), the 13th heuristic incorporates infeasibility checks, remaining capacity ratio calculation, fill-up bias, and normalization, resulting in a more sophisticated and robust approach compared to the basic Gaussian approach with desperation and randomness of the 20th.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (13th), the 1st heuristic uses Gaussian distribution to calculate the priority and handles the desperation case using `min_cap` while the 13th heuristic calculates remaining capacity ratio, fill-up bonus and normalizes the priorities to the range [0,1].\n\nOverall: The better heuristics employ more comprehensive strategies, considering factors such as remaining capacity ratios, fill-up biases, and normalization to ensure a balanced and effective bin selection process. They also address edge cases, such as when no bin can accommodate the item, with specific strategies. The inclusion of slight randomness can further enhance the solution quality by escaping local optima. Simpler heuristics tend to focus only on the most immediate factors and lack the adaptability needed for diverse scenarios.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a structured approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, robust evaluation, controlled diversification, constraint handling.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to problem characteristics. Implement rigorous evaluation metrics beyond immediate fit. Introduce controlled randomness strategically. Prioritize feasibility maintenance.\n*   **Avoid:** Rigid, static strategies; solely focusing on initial performance; uncontrolled randomness; ignoring constraints early.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics blend adaptability with robust evaluation, mitigating premature convergence and proactively managing feasibility. Controlled diversification helps explore the solution space without sacrificing solution quality entirely.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
