Okay, I'm ready to help you design better heuristics! Let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, Learning, Performance Metrics, Constraint Awareness.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that adapt based on problem instance characteristics and learn from past performance. Track key metrics to identify weaknesses and adjust strategies accordingly.
*   **Avoid:** Generic "one-size-fits-all" approaches. Focus on context-specific adaptations.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of passively incorporating features, design heuristics that actively analyze the problem and *dynamically* adjust their behavior for improved efficiency.
