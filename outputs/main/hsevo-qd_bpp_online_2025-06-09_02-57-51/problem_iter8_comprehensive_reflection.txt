Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Quantitative metrics (bin utilization, fragmentation), adaptive parameters, normalization methods (scaling, ranking), exploration-exploitation balance, fine-grained control.

*   **Advice:** Focus on measurable impact: define clear performance metrics and track them. Implement adaptive parameter control based on problem instance characteristics.

*   **Avoid:** Vague notions of "balance" and "stability". Resist adding randomness without a clear justification.

*   **Explanation:** Shift from general feelings to specific, quantifiable techniques. Instead of "stability," consider things like reducing solution variance across similar instances. Instead of vaguely "balancing," define the exploration/exploitation trade-off explicitly through parameters that can be tuned.
