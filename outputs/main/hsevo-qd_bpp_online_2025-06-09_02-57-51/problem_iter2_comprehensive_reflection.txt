Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a structured approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, robust evaluation, controlled diversification, constraint handling.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to problem characteristics. Implement rigorous evaluation metrics beyond immediate fit. Introduce controlled randomness strategically. Prioritize feasibility maintenance.
*   **Avoid:** Rigid, static strategies; solely focusing on initial performance; uncontrolled randomness; ignoring constraints early.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics blend adaptability with robust evaluation, mitigating premature convergence and proactively managing feasibility. Controlled diversification helps explore the solution space without sacrificing solution quality entirely.
