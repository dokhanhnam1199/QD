**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that 1st has more fine-grained control over bin selection, using parameters like `inverse_diff_epsilon`, `nearly_full_bonus_weight`, and `nearly_full_exponent_scale` to tune bin priorities and 20th uses gaussian-like function. 2nd vs 19th are similar to 1st vs 20th in terms of fine-grained control. Comparing (5th) vs (20th), 5th contains randomness for exploration. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), 1st does not contain randomness, the penalty or boosting term is different, and also the parameter of 1st is more than 5th. Comparing (13th) vs (14th), they are very similar and both are gaussian-like function with randomness. Comparing (15th) vs (13th), 15th function normalizes the priorities to the range of [0, 1] and uses infeasible mask. Comparing (17th) vs (18th), 17th function normalizes the priorities to the range of [0, 1] and uses infeasible mask while 18th uses gaussian-like function. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are similar. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more sophisticated strategies like remaining capacity ratios, normalization, infeasibility handling, fine-grained control over bin selection, while also considering trade-offs like exploration with randomness. Simpler heuristics rely on Gaussian-like functions and less parameters.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider a multi-faceted approach that includes feasibility checks, remaining capacity ratios, fill-up biases, normalization, and, where appropriate, a degree of randomness for exploration. Fine-grained control also help to control bin priorities.
