**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates bin utilization awareness, item size consideration, a dynamic fragmentation penalty, and a fallback strategy, while the worst uses a Gaussian-like priority based on remaining capacity closeness to item size, a "desperation" factor, and slight randomness.

(2nd) vs (19th): Very similar to (1st) vs (20th).

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no differences. They are exactly the same.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see no differences. They are exactly the same.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), the heuristic in (19th) calculates the ratio of remaining capacity *after* adding the item to the original remaining capacity, adds a bonus to bins with a remaining capacity close to the item size, and normalizes the final priorities to the range of [0,1]. The heuristic in (20th) uses a Gaussian-like priority based on remaining capacity closeness to item size, a "desperation" factor, and slight randomness.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), we see (12th) combines ratio-based prioritization with dynamic fill-up bonus and randomness, it normalizes the priorities to the range [0, 1]. (11th) uses parameters and no normalization.

Overall: The better heuristics emphasize a combination of factors, including bin utilization, item size, fragmentation penalties, and fallback strategies, along with normalization, while also employing adaptive randomness to diversify bin selection. The poorer heuristics focus primarily on closeness to item size (using a Gaussian-like function) and a desperation factor, with less attention to these other elements.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider a combination of factors such as bin utilization, item size, fragmentation, and fallback strategies. Adaptive randomness and normalization can improve performance. Testing and tuning the weights of the various factors is also key.
