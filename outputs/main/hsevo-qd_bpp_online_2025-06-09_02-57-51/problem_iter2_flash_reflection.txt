**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a Gaussian-like function to prioritize bins with remaining capacity close to the item size, incorporates a "desperation" factor to handle cases where no bins can fit the item, and adds slight randomness to avoid local optima. The worst heuristic only uses a simplified calculation of bin fullness and does not include these advanced features.

Comparing (13th) vs (20th), the 13th heuristic incorporates infeasibility checks, remaining capacity ratio calculation, fill-up bias, and normalization, resulting in a more sophisticated and robust approach compared to the basic Gaussian approach with desperation and randomness of the 20th.

Comparing (1st) vs (13th), the 1st heuristic uses Gaussian distribution to calculate the priority and handles the desperation case using `min_cap` while the 13th heuristic calculates remaining capacity ratio, fill-up bonus and normalizes the priorities to the range [0,1].

Overall: The better heuristics employ more comprehensive strategies, considering factors such as remaining capacity ratios, fill-up biases, and normalization to ensure a balanced and effective bin selection process. They also address edge cases, such as when no bin can accommodate the item, with specific strategies. The inclusion of slight randomness can further enhance the solution quality by escaping local optima. Simpler heuristics tend to focus only on the most immediate factors and lack the adaptability needed for diverse scenarios.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider a multi-faceted approach that balances immediate fit with long-term bin utilization. Incorporate strategies to handle infeasible scenarios and normalize priorities to ensure stability. Adding a touch of randomness can help the heuristic escape local optima and discover better solutions.
