Prioritize tight fits, and avoid overly full bins. Handle infeasibility, and prevent division by zero.

Focus on feasibility, minimizing waste, and avoiding overly full bins for optimal performance.

Prioritize perfect fits. Infeasible assignments should have significantly low priority. Exploit remaining capacity information.

Prioritize feasibility, then remaining capacity. Add utilization bonus and fragmentation penalty.

Combining "best fit" with fragmentation reduction yields better bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize fitting, normalize remaining capacity, and use randomness for tie-breaking. Avoid strong penalties.

The better code favors bins with less waste *after* packing, directly optimizing bin utilization with a simpler approach.

The better code uses multiple explicit, interpretable heuristics focusing on fit and fragmentation avoidance.

Prioritize least waste after fitting. Avoid complex, conflicting heuristics and favor simplicity and directness.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste, penalize overflow, and balance bin utilization.
