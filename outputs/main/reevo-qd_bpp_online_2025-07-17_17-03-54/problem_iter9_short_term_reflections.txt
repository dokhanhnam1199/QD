Feasibility, tight fit, and utilization are key. Prioritize bins that fit items well.

Better heuristics consider feasibility, filling bins, utilization, and fragmentation avoidance using capacity.

The improved code incorporates feasibility, best-fit, utilization, and randomness for better bin selection.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fit, utilization, and near-fullness for effective bin packing.

Feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization are crucial for effective bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fits, and higher bin utilization *after* item insertion.

Feasibility, best-fit, and fragmentation control are crucial. Penalize infeasibility and near-full bins.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fit, utilization, and near-fullness. Avoid direct ratio usage; consider post-fit states.

Feasibility, tight fit, bin utilization, and rewarding near-full bins are key for improved performance.

The improved code uses feasibility, remaining capacity, and fragmentation avoidance for better bin utilization.
