The better code prioritizes feasibility, best fit, and avoids overly full bins, improving packing efficiency.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, and penalize near-full bins. Consider bin fullness quadratically for refined control.

Feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization are key. Prioritize feasible bins and reward higher utilization.

Prioritize feasibility and best fit. Penalize near-full bins to balance space utilization, avoiding premature exhaustion.

Feasibility check, best-fit preference, and fullness penalty contribute to better bin selection.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, and balance utilization with fragmentation avoidance for better bin packing.

Feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization are key. Prioritize feasible and well-utilized bins.

The better code incorporates feasibility, bin utilization, and fragmentation avoidance, improving packing efficiency.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization to improve packing efficiency.

The better code uses feasibility checks, best-fit selection, and fullness penalties, for a more nuanced approach.
