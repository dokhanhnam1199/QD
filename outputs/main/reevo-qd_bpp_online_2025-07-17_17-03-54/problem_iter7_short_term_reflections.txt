Feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization after insertion are key to a good heuristic.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, and penalize near-full bins. Avoid direct ratios; consider non-linear relationships.

Feasibility checks, best-fit preference, fullness/emptiness consideration, and tie-breaking randomness are beneficial.

Feasibility, best-fit preference, fullness/emptiness considerations, and randomization improve bin packing heuristics.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, best fit, and penalizes near-full bins, leading to improved packing.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fit, and high bin utilization *after* item placement. Avoid ratio-based approaches.

Feasibility checks, best-fit targeting, fullness/emptiness bonuses, and tie-breaking randomness improve performance.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization after insertion for improved packing.

The better code uses feasibility checks, best-fit selection, and fullness penalty for improved bin packing.

Feasibility, tight fit, and bin utilization after insertion are key to a better heuristic.
