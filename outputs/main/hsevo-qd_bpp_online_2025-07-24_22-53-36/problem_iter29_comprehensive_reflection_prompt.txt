{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, balance complexity and nuance in scoring systems, and consider tunable parameters for flexibility.\nTo design better heuristics, focus on prioritizing bins based on how tightly they can fit the item, and consider normalizing the priority scores to avoid numerical issues and make the scores more interpretable.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors like bin fullness and item fit, introduce tunable parameters for flexibility, and ensure stability through techniques like epsilon addition.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining relevant scores (bin fullness, fit, etc.) with tunable weights, and incorporate techniques like epsilon values and normalization to handle edge cases and improve robustness.\n\nTo design better heuristics, prioritize simplicity, focusing on bin fullness and item fit scores, and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simplicity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundant parameters, and ensure diverse implementations to maximize the potential for improvement.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on developing multi-faceted scoring systems with tunable weights and normalization to improve robustness and adaptability.\n\nSimplicity is key when designing effective heuristics; avoid unnecessary complexity and tunable parameters unless proven to be beneficial.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors (bin fullness, item fit, remaining capacity) with tunable weights and thresholds, and consider normalization for robustness.\n\nTo design better heuristics, focus on simplicity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and tunable parameters unless they provide clear benefits.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
