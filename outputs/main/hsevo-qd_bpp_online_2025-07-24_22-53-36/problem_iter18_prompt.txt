Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    The priority is higher for bins that have enough capacity for the item, \n    are more full and have a remaining capacity that is as close as possible to the item size.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity for each bin after adding the item\n    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Check if the bin has enough capacity for the item\n    has_enough_capacity = remaining_cap_after_addition >= 0\n    \n    # Calculate a score that rewards bins where the remaining capacity is close to zero (i.e., the bin is full)\n    # and penalizes bins where the remaining capacity is large compared to the item size\n    bin_fullness_score = np.where(has_enough_capacity, \n                                  1 - (remaining_cap_after_addition / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-6)), \n                                  -1)\n    \n    # Calculate a score that rewards bins where the remaining capacity after addition is close to the item size\n    remaining_cap_score = np.where(has_enough_capacity, \n                                   1 / (1 + np.abs(remaining_cap_after_addition - item) / (item + 1e-6)), \n                                   0)\n    \n    # Combine the two scores to get the final priority score\n    priority_scores = bin_fullness_score + remaining_cap_score\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information.\n\n* **Keywords**: multi-faceted scoring, tunable weights, normalization, bin prioritization, simplicity, clarity.\n* **Advice**: Develop scoring systems that incorporate multiple factors and are adaptable through tunable parameters. Consider normalization to enhance interpretability and robustness.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity and redundant parameters. Ensure that the approaches are not repetitive by focusing on diverse implementations.\n* **Explanation**: By combining the essence of the current self-reflection (multi-faceted scoring, normalization) and avoiding the repetitive aspects of ineffective self-reflection (combining multiple factors, simplicity), we can create more effective heuristics that balance complexity and clarity.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
