**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) vs the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use more sophisticated scoring systems, including multiple weighted components, whereas the worst ones tend to oversimplify or lack tuning. 
(1st) vs (2nd) shows identical code, indicating a potential issue with the ranking. 
(3rd) vs (4th) and (5th) vs (6th) again show similarities, with slight variations in parameters. 
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), we see that (20th) has a more comprehensive scoring system, including item size similarity, which is lacking in (19th). 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to have more complex scoring systems, tunable parameters, and normalization.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on developing multi-faceted scoring systems with tunable weights and normalization to improve robustness and adaptability.
