To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a summary in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Tunable weights, normalization, bin fullness, item fit, simplicity, robustness.
* **Advice**: Combine multiple relevant factors with tunable weights and consider normalization for robustness; prioritize bins based on tight fit.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant parameters, and lack of normalization or tunable weights unless simplicity is proven effective.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on a balanced combination of relevant factors and avoiding ineffective approaches, we can design more robust and adaptable heuristics.
