**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst heuristic (20th), we see that both use a combination of bin fullness and remaining capacity scores, but the best heuristic uses a more straightforward calculation for the scores and does not introduce additional tunable parameters. 
Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, we see that the 2nd heuristic introduces tunable weights, which may allow for more flexibility but also adds complexity. 
The worst heuristics (19th and 20th) are identical and introduce additional scores and tunable parameters, making them more complex without clear benefits. 
Overall, simpler and more straightforward calculations tend to be more effective.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simplicity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and tunable parameters unless they provide clear benefits.
