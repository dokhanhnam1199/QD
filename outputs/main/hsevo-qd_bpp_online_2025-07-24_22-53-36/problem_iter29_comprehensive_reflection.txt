To design better heuristics, we need to analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

* Keywords: simplicity, tunable parameters, normalization, bin fullness, item fit.
* Advice: 
    - Balance complexity and nuance in scoring systems.
    - Focus on prioritizing bins based on how tightly they can fit the item.
    - Consider normalization to avoid numerical issues.
    - Simplify scoring systems while incorporating relevant factors.
* Avoid: unnecessary complexity, redundant parameters, ineffective use of tunable weights.
* Explanation: Effective heuristics require a balance between simplicity and nuance, considering factors like bin fullness and item fit while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
