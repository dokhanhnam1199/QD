Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords**: Simplicity, Bin fullness, Item fit, Normalization\n* **Advice**: Focus on simplicity and prioritize bins based on item fit and bin fullness while ensuring normalization.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, Tunable parameters, Epsilon addition, Combining multiple scores with weights.\n* **Explanation**: Simplify the heuristics by focusing on key factors like bin fullness and item fit, and normalize scores to avoid numerical issues, thus avoiding overly complex and parameterized approaches.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
