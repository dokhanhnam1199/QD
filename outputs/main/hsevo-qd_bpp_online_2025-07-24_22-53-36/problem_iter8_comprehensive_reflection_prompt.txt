{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining relevant scores (bin fullness, fit, etc.) with tunable weights, and incorporate techniques like epsilon values and normalization to handle edge cases and improve robustness.\nTo design better heuristics, focus on prioritizing bins based on how tightly they can fit the item, and consider normalizing the priority scores to avoid numerical issues and make the scores more interpretable.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors like bin fullness and item fit, introduce tunable parameters for flexibility, and ensure stability through techniques like epsilon addition.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
