**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic prioritizes bins based on their remaining capacity after adding the item, encouraging a tight fit. In contrast, the worst heuristic also uses a similar strategy but lacks normalization and has less consideration for edge cases. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both prioritize bins that fit the item tightly, but (1st) uses a slightly different formula. (2nd) and (7th) are identical in logic, suggesting a strong strategy. (3rd) prioritizes bins with less remaining capacity, which is a simpler but effective strategy. Overall, top heuristics tend to prioritize bins that are just enough to hold the item or have the least remaining capacity after adding the item, and they often normalize the priority scores.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on prioritizing bins based on how tightly they can fit the item, and consider normalizing the priority scores to avoid numerical issues and make the scores more interpretable.
