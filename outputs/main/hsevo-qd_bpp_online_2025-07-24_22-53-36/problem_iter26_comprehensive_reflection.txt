To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze and contrast it with 'Ineffective self-reflection'. 
Here are the takeaways in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Simplicity, clarity, bin prioritization, normalization.
* **Advice**: Focus on simplicity and clarity, prioritize bins based on tight fit, and consider normalization.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant or tunable parameters without clear benefits.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity and clear prioritization strategies like tight fit, and avoiding unnecessary complexity, we can design more effective heuristics that are interpretable and robust.
