**Analysis:**
Comparing the top-ranked heuristics, we see that the best heuristics (1st to 5th) share similar structures and components, such as checking if a bin has enough capacity, calculating bin fullness scores, and combining scores with weights. 
The top heuristics also use techniques like epsilon values to avoid division by zero and normalization to ensure scores are within a certain range. 
Comparing (1st) vs (5th), we see that the top heuristic uses a simpler scoring system, while the 5th heuristic introduces more complex weights and parameters (epsilon, bin_fullness_weight, fit_score_weight, etc.). 
The middle-ranked heuristics (10th to 15th) also use similar techniques but with varying weights and scoring systems. 
Comparing (10th) vs (15th), we see that the 10th heuristic uses a more straightforward scoring system, while the 15th heuristic introduces an index bias to break ties. 
The lower-ranked heuristics (16th to 20th) tend to use simpler scoring systems and fewer parameters. 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to use a combination of bin fullness scores, fit scores, and weights to determine priority, and often include techniques to handle edge cases and normalize scores.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining relevant scores (bin fullness, fit, etc.) with tunable weights, and incorporate techniques like epsilon values and normalization to handle edge cases and improve robustness.
