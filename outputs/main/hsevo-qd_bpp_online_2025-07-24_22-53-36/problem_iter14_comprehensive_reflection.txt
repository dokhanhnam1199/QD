To design better heuristics, let's redefine the 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a refined analysis:

* **Keywords**: Simplicity, Clarity, Priority, Normalization
* **Advice**: Focus on bin priority and item fit while ensuring diverse implementations.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant parameters, and ineffective combinations of factors.
* **Explanation**: By prioritizing simplicity and clarity, and focusing on effective factors like bin priority and item fit, we can design better heuristics that maximize potential for improvement while avoiding common pitfalls.
