To redefine 'Current self-reflection', let's first analyze it and then derive new insights.

### Analysis
The 'Current self-reflection' emphasizes combining multiple relevant factors, introducing tunable parameters for flexibility, and ensuring stability. It also prioritizes bins based on how tightly they can fit an item and considers normalizing priority scores.

### Redefined Current self-reflection
Given there's no 'Ineffective self-reflection' to avoid, we'll build upon the existing ideas and expand them. Here's a redefined version broken down into 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Multi-factor heuristics, tunable parameters, stability techniques, bin prioritization, normalization.
* **Advice**: Experiment with different combinations of factors and tunable parameters to find the optimal heuristic. Consider using machine learning techniques to learn the optimal parameters.
* **Avoid**: Potentially complex and computationally expensive methods that don't significantly improve the heuristic's performance.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on a combination of relevant factors, tunable parameters, and stability, and by prioritizing bins and normalizing scores, we can create more effective and adaptable heuristics.
