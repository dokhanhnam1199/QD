To design better heuristics, let's analyze the given information.

* **Keywords**: multi-faceted scoring, tunable weights, normalization, bin prioritization, simplicity, clarity.
* **Advice**: Develop scoring systems that incorporate multiple factors and are adaptable through tunable parameters. Consider normalization to enhance interpretability and robustness.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity and redundant parameters. Ensure that the approaches are not repetitive by focusing on diverse implementations.
* **Explanation**: By combining the essence of the current self-reflection (multi-faceted scoring, normalization) and avoiding the repetitive aspects of ineffective self-reflection (combining multiple factors, simplicity), we can create more effective heuristics that balance complexity and clarity.
