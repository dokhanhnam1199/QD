**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (`Heuristics 1st`) with the worst (`Heuristics 20th`), we see that the top heuristic combines bin fullness and remaining capacity scores effectively, while the worst heuristic has repetitive and less effective scoring. 
Comparing (`Heuristics 2nd`) vs (`Heuristics 19th`), we see that the second-best heuristic introduces weighted scores and epsilon for stability, whereas the second-worst heuristic lacks these refinements.
Comparing (`Heuristics 1st`) vs (`Heuristics 2nd`), we observe that both prioritize bins based on fullness and fit, but (`Heuristics 2nd`) includes additional parameters for tuning.
(`Heuristics 3rd`) vs (`Heuristics 18th`) shows that (`Heuristics 3rd`) prioritizes bins based on remaining capacity after addition and fullness, while (`Heuristics 18th`) uses a "fit score" and "fullness score".
Overall, top heuristics tend to have more nuanced scoring systems, consider multiple factors like bin fullness and item fit, and include mechanisms for stability and tuning.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors like bin fullness and item fit, introduce tunable parameters for flexibility, and ensure stability through techniques like epsilon addition.
