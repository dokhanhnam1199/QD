**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st, 2nd,3rd) vs the worst (18th, 19th,20th), we see that top heuristics have simpler, more straightforward implementations without unnecessary import statements and focus on bin fullness and item fit. 
The worst ones have additional parameters and normalization. 
Comparing (4th) vs (9th), (10th) we see the difference in complexity due to parameters and normalization.
(1st) vs (2nd) shows identical implementations, indicating potential redundancy.
Overall: Top heuristics prioritize simplicity, focusing on bin fullness and item fit, while lower-ranked ones introduce more complexity with additional parameters and normalization.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, prioritize simplicity, focusing on bin fullness and item fit scores, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
