Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) also shows identical code, indicating potential redundancy in the list. Comparing (1st) and (3rd), the top heuristic is simpler and doesn't use tunable parameters, whereas the 3rd heuristic introduces several parameters and additional complexity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (19th) and (20th) are identical, further indicating redundancy. Overall, the top heuristics tend to be simpler and more straightforward, while the lower-ranked ones introduce more complexity and parameters, sometimes with identical implementations.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's redefine the 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding the pitfalls of 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a refined analysis:\n\n* **Keywords**: Simplicity, Clarity, Priority, Normalization\n* **Advice**: Focus on bin priority and item fit while ensuring diverse implementations.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant parameters, and ineffective combinations of factors.\n* **Explanation**: By prioritizing simplicity and clarity, and focusing on effective factors like bin priority and item fit, we can design better heuristics that maximize potential for improvement while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
