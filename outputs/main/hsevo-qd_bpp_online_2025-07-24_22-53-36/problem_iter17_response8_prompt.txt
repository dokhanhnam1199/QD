Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Consider normalization to enhance interpretability and robustness.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity and redundant parameters. Ensure that the approaches are not repetitive by focusing on diverse implementations.\n* **Explanation**: By combining the essence of the current self-reflection (multi-faceted scoring, normalization) and avoiding the repetitive aspects of ineffective self-reflection (combining multiple factors, simplicity), we can create more effective heuristics that balance complexity and clarity.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
