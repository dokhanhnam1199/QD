**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a simple yet effective scoring system, while the worst has more complexity with tunable parameters. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use similar scoring systems, but (2nd) introduces tunable weights. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that (4th) has additional tunable parameters. 
Overall, simpler heuristics tend to be more effective, and the introduction of tunable parameters does not necessarily improve performance.

**Experience:**
Simplicity is key when designing effective heuristics; avoid unnecessary complexity and tunable parameters unless proven to be beneficial.
