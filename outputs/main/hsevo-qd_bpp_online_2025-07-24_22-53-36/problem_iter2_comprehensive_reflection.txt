To improve the design of heuristics, let's rethink the 'Current self-reflection'. Here are the key takeaways:

* **Keywords**: prioritization, normalization, bin fitting
* **Advice**: Explore alternative prioritization methods and normalization techniques to improve heuristic performance.
* **Avoid**: Blindly following traditional prioritization methods without considering the specific problem context.
* **Explanation**: By re-examining the approach to prioritization and normalization, we can identify potential improvements to the heuristic design, such as using more sophisticated bin fitting strategies or adaptive normalization techniques.
