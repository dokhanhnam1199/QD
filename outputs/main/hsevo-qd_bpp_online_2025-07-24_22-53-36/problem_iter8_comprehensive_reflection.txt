To refine 'Current self-reflection' and avoid 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's analyze and redefine it. Here's a redefined version in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Tunable weights, normalization, epsilon values, priority scores.
* **Advice**: Combine multiple scores with tunable weights and consider normalization to improve robustness and avoid numerical issues.
* **Avoid**: Repetitive suggestions (e.g., "tunable parameters" is similar to "tunable weights"), and vague terms (e.g., "ensure stability" is too broad).
* **Explanation**: The redefined self-reflection focuses on specific, actionable techniques like normalization and epsilon values, while avoiding vague or repetitive suggestions, to effectively design better heuristics.
