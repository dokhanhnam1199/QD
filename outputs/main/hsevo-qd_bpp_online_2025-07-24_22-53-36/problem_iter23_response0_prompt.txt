Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                epsilon: float = 1e-6, \n                bin_fullness_weight: float = 1.0, \n                fit_score_weight: float = 0.5) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority scores for each bin based on bin fullness and item fit.\n    Combines elements of top heuristics for effective bin prioritization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the bin has enough capacity for the item\n    has_enough_capacity = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # Calculate bin fullness score, rewarding bins that are fuller\n    bin_fullness_score = np.where(has_enough_capacity, \n                                  1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon), \n                                  -1)\n    \n    # Calculate fit score, prioritizing bins that fit the item tightly\n    fit_score = np.where(has_enough_capacity, \n                         1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item - item) / (item + epsilon)), \n                         0)\n    \n    # Combine the two scores to get the final priority score with weights\n    priority_scores = bin_fullness_weight * bin_fullness_score + fit_score_weight * fit_score\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines bin fullness and item fit scores for effective bin prioritization.\n    Rewards bins that are fuller and fit the item tightly.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the bin has enough capacity for the item with a small threshold\n    epsilon = 1e-6  # Small value to avoid division by zero\n    has_enough_capacity = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # Calculate bin fullness score, rewarding fuller bins\n    bin_fullness_score = np.where(has_enough_capacity, 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon), -1)\n    \n    # Calculate fit score, prioritizing tight fits\n    fit_score = np.where(has_enough_capacity, 1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)), 0)\n    \n    # Combine scores with equal weights for simplicity\n    priority_scores = 0.5 * bin_fullness_score + 0.5 * fit_score\n    \n    return priority_scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines bin fullness and item fit scores effectively, while the worst only considers bin fullness. \nThe top heuristics (1st-5th) all have a similar structure, combining bin fullness and fit scores with varying weights and thresholds. \nIn contrast, the lower-ranked heuristics (15th-20th) tend to simplify or omit certain aspects, such as item fit or normalization.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a summary in 4 bullet points:\n\n* **Keywords**: Tunable weights, normalization, bin fullness, item fit, simplicity, robustness.\n* **Advice**: Combine multiple relevant factors with tunable weights and consider normalization for robustness; prioritize bins based on tight fit.\n* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant parameters, and lack of normalization or tunable weights unless simplicity is proven effective.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on a balanced combination of relevant factors and avoiding ineffective approaches, we can design more robust and adaptable heuristics.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
