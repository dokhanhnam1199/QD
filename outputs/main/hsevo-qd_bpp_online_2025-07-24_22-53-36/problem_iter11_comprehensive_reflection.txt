To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords**: Simplicity, Bin fullness, Item fit, Normalization
* **Advice**: Focus on simplicity and prioritize bins based on item fit and bin fullness while ensuring normalization.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, Tunable parameters, Epsilon addition, Combining multiple scores with weights.
* **Explanation**: Simplify the heuristics by focusing on key factors like bin fullness and item fit, and normalize scores to avoid numerical issues, thus avoiding overly complex and parameterized approaches.
