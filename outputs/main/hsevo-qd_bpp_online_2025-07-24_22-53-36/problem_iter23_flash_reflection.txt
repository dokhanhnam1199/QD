**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic combines bin fullness and item fit scores effectively, while the worst only considers bin fullness. 
The top heuristics (1st-5th) all have a similar structure, combining bin fullness and fit scores with varying weights and thresholds. 
In contrast, the lower-ranked heuristics (15th-20th) tend to simplify or omit certain aspects, such as item fit or normalization.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple relevant factors (bin fullness, item fit, remaining capacity) with tunable weights and thresholds, and consider normalization for robustness.
