**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that both heuristics combine bin fullness and item fit scores, but the 1st heuristic uses more complex scoring systems and has more nuanced weighting. (2nd) vs (19th) shows that the top heuristics often include additional parameters for tuning. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 2nd has more parameters to potentially overfit. Overall, top heuristics balance complexity with nuanced scoring.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, balance complexity and nuance in scoring systems, and consider tunable parameters for flexibility.
