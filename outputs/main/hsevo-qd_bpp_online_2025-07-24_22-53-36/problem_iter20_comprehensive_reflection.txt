To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

* **Keywords**: Simplicity, bin prioritization, normalization
* **Advice**: Focus on straightforward bin prioritization methods and consider normalization to enhance interpretability.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundant tunable parameters, and overemphasis on multi-faceted scoring systems unless proven beneficial.
* **Explanation**: By prioritizing simplicity and focusing on effective bin prioritization, we can create more efficient heuristics that avoid unnecessary complexity and tunable parameters, ultimately leading to more interpretable and robust solutions.
