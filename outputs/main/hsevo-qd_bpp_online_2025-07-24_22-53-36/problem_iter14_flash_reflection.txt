**Analysis:**
Comparing the best (1st) and the worst (20th) heuristics, we see that both use similar scoring mechanisms, but the best heuristic is more concise and directly calculates the priority scores. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) also shows identical code, indicating potential redundancy in the list. Comparing (1st) and (3rd), the top heuristic is simpler and doesn't use tunable parameters, whereas the 3rd heuristic introduces several parameters and additional complexity. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (19th) and (20th) are identical, further indicating redundancy. Overall, the top heuristics tend to be simpler and more straightforward, while the lower-ranked ones introduce more complexity and parameters, sometimes with identical implementations.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on simplicity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundant parameters, and ensure diverse implementations to maximize the potential for improvement.
