    diff = bins_remain_cap - item

    # We want bins where diff is close to 0 to have high priority.
    # The sigmoid function naturally maps values to the range (0, 1).
    # A common sigmoid function is 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
    # To center the peak at diff=0, we can use exp(-abs(diff)) or a scaled version.
    # A Gaussian-like shape centered at 0 can be achieved using exp(-(diff/scale)^2).
    # Let's scale the difference so that a "good fit" difference (e.g., diff close to 0)
    # maps to a significant change in the sigmoid's output.

    # A simple approach is to use exp(-abs(diff)). This will peak at 1 when diff is 0.
    # However, the sigmoid is generally defined as 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
    # To make it peak at 0, we can use exp(-k * diff**2) or related transformations.

    # Let's define a score based on how close the remaining capacity is to the item size.
    # We want to maximize the priority when bins_remain_cap is close to item.
    # Consider a sigmoid centered at the item size.
    # score = sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap)) or sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))
    # If we use sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap)), the peak is when item - bins_remain_cap = 0
    # i.e., bins_remain_cap = item.

    # We need to control the steepness of the sigmoid. A larger k means a steeper curve.
    # We can set k based on the expected range of capacities or item sizes.
    # For simplicity, let's use a fixed k. A value like 0.5 or 1 might be reasonable.
    # Let's also handle cases where item > bins_remain_cap, as these bins are invalid for the item.
    # We can assign a very low priority (e.g., 0) to such bins.

    # Let's map diff to a sigmoid such that diff = 0 gets a high score.
    # A possible transformation: use exp(-diff^2 / (2 * sigma^2)). This is a Gaussian.
    # To make it a sigmoid-like curve, let's reconsider the sigmoid form.
    # The logistic function f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
    # We want f(0) to be high. Let x = -k * diff.
    # Then f(-k*diff) = 1 / (1 + exp(k*diff)).
    # When diff = 0, f(0) = 1/2. This is not ideal.

    # A better approach for "fit score" would be to reward bins that are "almost full"
    # but can still fit the item.
    # This means bins with remaining capacity `c` such that `c >= item`.
    # Among these, we want `c` to be as close to `item` as possible.

    # Let's define the score based on the 'tightness' of the fit.
    # For bins where bins_remain_cap >= item:
    # score = sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))
    # This will make the score decrease as bins_remain_cap increases beyond item.
    # The maximum score is 0.5 when bins_remain_cap == item.
    # If we want the peak to be 1, we can scale or shift.

    # Let's try a different interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score" that focuses on
    # the "fitness" as the value being transformed by a sigmoid.
    # A bin is "fit" if its remaining capacity is greater than or equal to the item size.
    # For bins that are fit, we want to score based on how close the remaining capacity is to the item size.

    # Option 1: Gaussian-like approach for closeness.
    # sigma controls the width of the "good fit" zone.
    sigma = 0.5  # Hyperparameter controlling the "tightness" of the fit.
    scores_gaussian = np.exp(-(diff**2) / (2 * sigma**2))

    # Ensure bins that cannot fit the item have zero priority.
    invalid_mask = bins_remain_cap < item
    scores_gaussian[invalid_mask] = 0

    # This gives a Gaussian shape, peaking at 1 when diff=0.
    # If we want a sigmoid shape that smoothly transitions to 0, we could use
    # 1 / (1 + exp(k * diff)) for diff > 0 and something else for diff < 0.

    # Let's refine this to be more sigmoid-like, but still centered on 0 diff.
    # Consider a sigmoid where the input is proportional to `item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # Let k be the steepness.
    k = 2.0 # Steepness parameter
    # The standard logistic sigmoid: 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
    # If we use x = k * (item - bins_remain_cap), the peak is at item == bins_remain_cap.
    # When item > bins_remain_cap, x is positive, exp(x) is large, sigmoid -> 0.
    # When item < bins_remain_cap, x is negative, exp(x) is small, sigmoid -> 1.
    # This is the opposite of what we want if we interpret sigmoid(0) as the best.

    # Let's use the logistic function to penalize larger differences.
    # We want higher scores when bins_remain_cap is close to 'item'.
    # For bins where bins_remain_cap >= item:
    # Let's transform `bins_remain_cap - item`. We want smaller values of this to be good.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(x))` decreases as x increases.
    # If we set x = k * (bins_remain_cap - item), then when diff=0, x=0, score=0.5.
    # When diff > 0, x > 0, score < 0.5. When diff < 0, x < 0, score > 0.5.
    # This is also not quite right if we want the peak at diff=0.

    # Let's consider what "Sigmoid Fit Score" might imply more directly:
    # The "fitness" is the closeness of `bins_remain_cap` to `item`.
    # A function that maps `|bins_remain_cap - item|` to a score.
    # We want `score` to be high when `|bins_remain_cap - item|` is low.

    # Let's use a sigmoid to transform a measure of "badness" into a priority.
    # "Badness" could be `|bins_remain_cap - item|`.
    # Higher badness -> lower priority.
    # Let's use `1 - sigmoid(k * |diff|)` where sigmoid is logistic.
    # sigmoid(0) = 0.5. So 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.
    # As |diff| increases, sigmoid(k*|diff|) increases, so 1 - sigmoid(...) decreases.
    # This gives a priority that peaks at 0.5 and decreases.

    # Another interpretation: "Sigmoid Fit Score" means the *probability* of fitting,
    # where this probability is modeled by a sigmoid function of some quality metric.
    # Quality metric = how close `bins_remain_cap` is to `item`.

    # Let's use the idea that bins with remaining capacity *just* large enough to fit
    # the item are good candidates. We want to prioritize bins that are "tight fits".
    # We can model this using a sigmoid that peaks when `bins_remain_cap` is
    # slightly larger than `item`.

    # Let's define a measure of "how well the item fits":
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, fit is impossible (very low score).
    # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`, the fit is possible. The "tightness" is
    # `bins_remain_cap - item`. We want this difference to be small.
    # Let `tightness = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want to maximize priority when `tightness` is small (close to 0).

    # Let's use a sigmoid of the form `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` where `x` is designed
    # to be high for small `tightness`.
    # If we use `x = -k * tightness`, then when `tightness = 0`, `x=0`, sigmoid=0.5.
    # When `tightness > 0` (but small), `x < 0`, sigmoid > 0.5.
    # When `tightness` is large, `x` is large negative, sigmoid -> 1. This is NOT what we want.

    # Let's flip the sigmoid: `1 / (1 + exp(x))`. This decreases as x increases.
    # If `x = k * tightness`, when `tightness=0`, `x=0`, sigmoid=0.5.
    # When `tightness > 0` (small), `x > 0`, sigmoid < 0.5.
    # When `tightness` is large, `x` is large positive, sigmoid -> 0.
    # This penalizes large `tightness`.
    # The peak is at 0.5, not 1.

    # To achieve a peak of 1, we can consider:
    # `1 - 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` => `exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # Let `x = k * (item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # If `item == bins_remain_cap`, `x=0`, score = 0.5 / (1+0.5) = 1/3. Still not 1.

    # Let's use a sigmoid to map the *normalized* "closeness" to a priority.
    # Normalize `bins_remain_cap - item` relative to `item` itself, or some max capacity.
    # For a fixed bin capacity `C` and item size `s`:
    # If `c < s`, invalid.
    # If `c >= s`:
    # Consider the "waste" `w = c - s`. We want to minimize `w`.
    # `w` ranges from 0 up to `C - s`.

    # Let's consider a simplified sigmoid score: the proportion of remaining capacity that is *unused* by the item.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, unused proportion is effectively infinite or invalid.
    # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
    #   Unused capacity = `bins_remain_cap - item`
    #   Total capacity available for this item (that isn't strictly needed) = `bins_remain_cap`
    #   Unused proportion = `(bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap`
    # This value is between 0 (perfect fit) and `(C-item)/C` (if `bins_remain_cap` is `C`).
    # We want to penalize larger unused proportions.
    # Let `u = (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap` for `bins_remain_cap > 0`.
    # We want a sigmoid that maps `u` to a priority.
    # If `u=0` (perfect fit), priority should be high (e.g., 1).
    # If `u` is large, priority should be low.
    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * u))` works well for this.
    #   When `u=0`, score=0.5.
    #   When `u > 0`, `exp(k*u)` increases, score decreases.
    #   To get a peak of 1 at `u=0`, we could use `1 - (1 / (1 + exp(-k*u)))` (logistic),
    #   or similar, but we need to manage the invalid cases.

    # Let's define a "fit quality" function first, then apply a sigmoid.
    # A simple fit quality: `item / bins_remain_cap` if `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # This value is between `item/item = 1` (perfect fit) and `item/C` (if `bins_remain_cap` is `C`).
    # We want to maximize priority when `fit_quality` is close to 1.
    # Let `q = item / bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want a sigmoid that maps `q` to priority.
    # `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (q - 1)))`
    # When `q = 1` (perfect fit), `x=0`, sigmoid = 0.5.
    # When `q < 1` (bins_remain_cap > item), `q-1 < 0`, `x < 0`, sigmoid > 0.5.
    # When `q > 1` (bins_remain_cap < item), this case is invalid.

    # Let's simplify and use a common heuristic for BPP which is often called "Best Fit".
    # Best Fit: choose the bin that leaves the least remaining capacity.
    # This means prioritizing bins where `bins_remain_cap - item` is minimized.
    # Our sigmoid approach should reflect this.

    # Let's focus on the structure: sigmoid(f(item, bins_remain_cap))
    # where f is a metric of "goodness" of fit.
    # metric `m = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want to minimize `m`.
    # A function `g(m)` that is high for small `m` and low for large `m`.
    # Then apply sigmoid: `Sigmoid(k * g(m))`.

    # Let `g(m) = -m` if `m >= 0`, and some very small value otherwise.
    # If `m >= 0`: Sigmoid(k * (-m)) = 1 / (1 + exp(k*m)).
    # This gives peak of 0.5 at m=0, and decreases.

    # If we want the peak to be 1:
    # Consider a shifted and scaled sigmoid.
    # A standard sigmoid is S(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
    # We want S(0) = 1. This is not possible with this form.

    # Let's use a Sigmoid-like function that peaks at 1.
    # A bell curve scaled to be like a sigmoid that goes from 0 to 1.
    # e.g. `0.5 + 0.5 * tanh(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
    # `tanh(x)` goes from -1 to 1. `tanh(0)=0`.
    # So, `0.5 + 0.5 * tanh(0)` = 0.5. Still not peaking at 1.

    # Revisit the Gaussian-like approach:
    # `np.exp(-(diff**2) / (2 * sigma**2))` is a good candidate for a *fitness* score,
    # peaking at 1 when diff is 0. It's not strictly sigmoid, but it's often used
    # as a smooth priority function.

    # Let's try to interpret "Sigmoid Fit Score" as using the sigmoid function itself
    # to define the priority for bins that can accommodate the item.
    # For bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
    # The "degree of fit" can be measured by how much capacity is "left over".
    # Left over = `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want to assign higher priority to smaller "left over" values.

    # Consider the transformation: `1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap == item`, score = 0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap > item` (and `k > 0`), score < 0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item` (invalid), `k*(negative value)` would lead to a large score.

    # Let's set `k` and then handle invalid bins.
    # A moderate `k` could be 2 or 3.
    k_sigmoid = 3.0

    # Calculate potential scores using sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))
    # This maps item == bin_remain_cap to 0.5.
    # item < bin_remain_cap maps to > 0.5.
    # item > bin_remain_cap maps to < 0.5.

    # We want:
    # - High priority when `bins_remain_cap` is *just enough* (i.e., `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and non-negative).
    # - Low priority when `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`.
    # - Zero priority when `bins_remain_cap < item`.

    # Let's define a function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` as our sigmoid.
    # We want to input a value `v` such that `v=0` gives `f(0)=0.5`, and we want to
    # transform `v` to center the desired priority.
    # If `bins_remain_cap == item`, we want high priority.
    # Let `residual = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want high priority when `residual` is close to 0.

    # A robust sigmoid approach for prioritizing closeness to a target `T`:
    # Priority = sigmoid(slope * (target - current_value))
    # Here, `target = item`, `current_value = bins_remain_cap`.
    # Priority = sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))

    # If item == bins_remain_cap: `k * 0` -> `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`
    # If item < bins_remain_cap: `k * negative` -> `sigmoid(negative) > 0.5`
    # If item > bins_remain_cap: `k * positive` -> `sigmoid(positive) < 0.5`

    # This is prioritizing bins where `bins_remain_cap` is *larger* than `item`, which is incorrect.

    # Let's try the inverse:
    # Priority = sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))
    # If bins_remain_cap == item: `k * 0` -> `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`
    # If bins_remain_cap > item: `k * positive` -> `sigmoid(positive) > 0.5`
    # If bins_remain_cap < item: `k * negative` -> `sigmoid(negative) < 0.5`

    # This prioritizes bins with *more* remaining capacity, not less.

    # The "Sigmoid Fit Score" strategy should really focus on the "fit" itself.
    # Consider the "slack" or "waste": `waste = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We want to maximize priority for `waste = 0`.
    # Let's map `waste` to a sigmoid.
    # A function that maps `waste=0` to 1, and increases as `waste` increases (decaying priority).
    # Try `1 / (1 + exp(k * waste))`.
    # If `waste=0`, score = 0.5.
    # If `waste > 0`, score < 0.5.
    # If `waste < 0` (invalid), `k*waste` is negative, score > 0.5.

    # We need to ensure invalid bins get 0 priority.
    # Let's define `scaled_waste = (bins_remain_cap - item) / max_possible_waste`.
    # `max_possible_waste` could be `bin_capacity - min_item_size` or similar.

    # A simpler approach that is often described as sigmoid-like for BPP is to use
    # the value `item / bins_remain_cap` if `bins_remain_cap >= item`, and 0 otherwise,
    # and then apply a sigmoid transformation.

    # Let's use the sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` as the core.
    # We need to find an input `x` that, when fed into this sigmoid, gives us the desired priority.
    # We want priority = 1 when `bins_remain_cap` is just slightly larger than `item`.
    # And priority decreases as `bins_remain_cap` grows larger.

    # Let `penalty = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If `penalty < 0`, priority is 0.
    # If `penalty >= 0`:
    # We want a function that is high for small `penalty` and low for large `penalty`.
    # Consider `sigmoid_score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * penalty))`
    # If `penalty = 0`, score = 0.5.
    # If `penalty = 1`, score = `1 / (1 + exp(k))`.
    # If `penalty = large`, score approaches 0.

    # To get a peak of 1 at `penalty = 0`, we can try:
    # `1 - 0.5 * sigmoid_score`  => `1 - 0.5 * (1 / (1 + exp(k * penalty)))`
    # If `penalty = 0`, `1 - 0.5 * 0.5` = `1 - 0.25` = 0.75. Still not 1.

    # Let's use the "Best Fit" heuristic concept and warp it with a sigmoid.
    # Best Fit Score: `bins_remain_cap - item`. Minimize this.
    # We want to convert `bins_remain_cap - item` (which is >= 0 for valid bins)
    # into a priority, where smaller values yield higher priorities.

    # Define `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If `x < 0`, priority = 0.
    # If `x >= 0`, priority = `1 / (1 + exp(k * x))` is a decreasing function.
    # To make it peak at `x=0` and go to 0 for large `x`, we want `f(0) = 1`.

    # Let's use a transformation of `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # A function that is 0 when `x` is large, and 1 when `x` is close to 0.
    # Sigmoid properties: mapping a continuous input to (0, 1) or (-1, 1).

    # Let's consider the probability that a bin is "ideal" for the item.
    # Ideal = remaining capacity is very close to item size.
    # Probability = `sigmoid(k * (target - current))`
    # We want target = item, current = bins_remain_cap.
    # But we need to handle the constraint `bins_remain_cap >= item`.

    # Let's re-implement the logic for a tight fit:
    # Prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap` is *just* large enough.
    # This means `bins_remain_cap - item` should be small and non-negative.

    # Metric `m = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If `m < 0`, priority = 0.
    # If `m >= 0`:
    #   We want to map `m` to `[0, 1]` such that `m=0` maps to `1`.
    #   And `m` increasing maps to `priority` decreasing.
    #   A sigmoid like `1 / (1 + exp(k * m))` achieves decreasing, but peaks at 0.5.

    # Let's shift and scale the input to the sigmoid to achieve the desired range.
    # Target function: f(m) where f(0)=1 and f(large)=0.
    # We can use `1 - sigmoid(a*m + b)`.
    # sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))
    # 1 - 1/(1+exp(-a*m - b)) = exp(-a*m - b) / (1+exp(-a*m - b))
    # This function decreases. If we want it to start at 1 for m=0:
    # At m=0: exp(-b) / (1+exp(-b)) = 1. This is only possible if exp(-b) -> infinity, which is not standard.

    # A common way to model priorities for a "best fit" approach with a sigmoid shape:
    # Normalize the "slack": `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We only consider bins where `slack >= 0`.
    # Scale the slack to be in a range that makes sense for sigmoid.
    # E.g., if bin capacities are up to 100, item sizes up to 50, max slack could be 100.
    # Let `scaled_slack = (bins_remain_cap - item) / MAX_CAPACITY`.

    # A simpler sigmoid definition:
    # Let's assign a high priority to bins where `bins_remain_cap` is slightly above `item`.
    # Use `sigmoid(slope * (item - (bins_remain_cap - threshold)))`
    # where threshold is small positive value to ensure `bins_remain_cap > item`.

    # Final attempt with a direct sigmoid mapping:
    # Let `quality = item / bins_remain_cap` for valid bins.
    # This is >= 1 for good fits. We want priority to be high when this is close to 1.
    # Let `x = k * (item / bins_remain_cap)`.
    # `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # If `item/bins_remain_cap = 1`, `x=k`, sigmoid = 0.5.
    # If `item/bins_remain_cap < 1` (bins_remain_cap > item), `x < k`, sigmoid > 0.5.
    # If `item/bins_remain_cap > 1` (bins_remain_cap < item), this is invalid.

    # Let's combine the "invalid bin" condition with the sigmoid.
    # For valid bins (`bins_remain_cap >= item`):
    # Calculate a "fit score" that is high when `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item`.
    # Metric: `1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / MAX_SINGLE_ITEM_SIZE` (or similar scaling)
    # This metric is 1 for perfect fit, and decreases.

    # A common way to implement "best fit" with a sigmoid-like characteristic is to prioritize
    # the bin that leaves the *least* remaining capacity.
    # We can represent this by transforming `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # For invalid bins (`x < 0`), priority is 0.
    # For valid bins (`x >= 0`):
    # We want a function `f(x)` where `f(0)` is max, and `f(x)` decreases as `x` increases.
    # A sigmoid function of `x` could work if we invert it or scale it correctly.
    # `1 - sigmoid(k * x)` is a candidate if `k > 0`.
    # `1 - 1/(1+exp(-k*x))` = `exp(-k*x) / (1+exp(-k*x))`.
    # For `x=0`, this is `1 / (1+1) = 0.5`. Still not 1.

    # Let's use `1 - sigmoid_inv(x)` where `sigmoid_inv` is increasing.
    # Consider `sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))`.
    # Let's define `priority = 1 - sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap == item`: `1 - sigmoid(0)` = `1 - 0.5` = 0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap > item`: `1 - sigmoid(positive)` = `1 - (>0.5)` = `(<0.5)`. This is decreasing priority.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`: `1 - sigmoid(negative)` = `1 - (<0.5)` = `(>0.5)`. This is incorrectly prioritizing invalid bins.

    # Let's ensure invalid bins get 0 priority, and then apply a sigmoid to the rest.
    # Parameter `k`: Controls how sharply the priority drops as remaining capacity increases.
    # Higher `k` means tighter fit preference.
    k_fit = 2.0 # Steepness parameter for the sigmoid

    # Calculate `residual = bins_remain_cap - item` for all bins.
    residual = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priorities to zero (for bins that cannot fit the item).
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that can fit the item.
    fit_mask = residual >= 0

    # For bins that can fit, calculate a score using a sigmoid function.
    # We want to give high priority to bins with small `residual` (i.e., tight fits).
    # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` increases with x.
    # So we want to transform `residual` to be a decreasing function of `x`.
    # Let's use `1 / (1 + exp(k_fit * residual))`.
    # This function decreases from 1 (as residual -> -inf) to 0 (as residual -> inf).
    # If `residual=0`, score is 0.5.
    # If `residual>0`, score < 0.5.
    # If `residual<0`, score > 0.5.

    # To make it peak at 1 when residual=0:
    # Consider `1 - 0.5 * sigmoid(k_fit * residual)` => `1 - 0.5 / (1 + exp(-k_fit * residual))`
    # This seems complicated.

    # A common strategy in literature is to use `1 / (1 + exp(k * (b_rem - item)))`
    # and apply it only to bins that fit.
    # If `b_rem - item = 0`, score = 0.5.
    # If `b_rem - item = large`, score -> 0.

    # Let's use this:
    # `priority_for_fit_bins = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k_fit * residual[fit_mask]))`
    # This yields scores between (0, 0.5] for `residual >= 0`.
    # To get scores in [0, 1] and peak at 1, we need to transform.

    # Let's scale the residual relative to something like the item size or a typical bin size.
    # For simplicity, let's use the residual directly but control the sigmoid's steepness.

    # A more principled approach for "Sigmoid Fit Score":
    # Imagine a probability of *selection* based on fit quality.
    # Fit quality = how close `bins_remain_cap` is to `item`.
    # Let `value_to_sigmoid = -k_fit * residual`. This maps small residuals to large positive values.
    # `sigmoid(value_to_sigmoid)` would be close to 1 for small residuals.
    # So, for valid bins:
    # `sigmoid_scores = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-k_fit * residual))`
    # If `residual=0`, score = 0.5.
    # If `residual > 0`, score < 0.5.
    # If `residual < 0`, score > 0.5.

    # The typical "Best Fit" heuristic aims to MINIMIZE `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # So, we want the priority to be high when `bins_remain_cap - item` is small.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Consider the sigmoid transformation `1 / (1 + exp(k * x))`.
    # This maps small `x` to high values and large `x` to low values.
    # For `x=0`, score=0.5. For `x>0`, score<0.5. For `x<0`, score>0.5.

    # Let's use a robust sigmoid that maps distance to 0.
    # `priority = sigmoid(k * (target_value - current_value))`
    # Target value for `bins_remain_cap` is `item`.
    # We want higher priority as `bins_remain_cap` approaches `item`.

    # Let's try: `priority = 1 - sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` on valid bins.
    # For valid bins: `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # `k = 2.0`
    # `metric = bins_remain_cap - item`
    # `priority_valid = 1 - (1 / (1 + np.exp(-k * metric)))`
    # For `metric = 0`, `priority = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.
    # For `metric > 0`, `1 - sigmoid(positive)` = `1 - (>0.5)` = `(<0.5)`.
    # This gives a decreasing priority for increasing residuals.

    # Let's make it peak at 1.
    # `priority = C * sigmoid(k * (ideal - current))`
    # We want `ideal = item` for `bins_remain_cap`.
    # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` has range (0, 1).
    # We want to center it and scale it.

    # Consider the function: `f(r) = exp(-k*r)` where `r = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # For valid bins `r >= 0`.
    # `f(0) = 1`. `f(r)` decreases as `r` increases.
    # This is close to what we want. It's Gaussian-like but decays exponentially.
    # Let's add epsilon to avoid log(0) if we ever use logs.

    # Let's try: `priority = exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item) / scale)`
    # This is exponential decay.

    # For Sigmoid Fit Score, let's use the standard sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # and find a suitable `x`.
    # We want priority to be high when `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item`.
    # Let's consider the metric `item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`, then `item - bins_remain_cap <= 0`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, then `item - bins_remain_cap > 0`.

    # Let `x = k * (item - bins_remain_cap)`
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap == item`: `x = 0`, `priority = 0.5`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap > item`: `x < 0`, `priority > 0.5`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`: `x > 0`, `priority < 0.5`.

    # This prioritizes bins with MORE capacity. Not what we want.

    # Let's reverse the argument: `x = k * (bins_remain_cap - item)`
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap == item`: `x = 0`, `priority = 0.5`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap > item`: `x > 0`, `priority > 0.5`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`: `x < 0`, `priority < 0.5`.

    # This still prioritizes bins with more capacity.

    # To prioritize bins with *less* remaining capacity, we want a function that
    # DECREASES with `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Use `1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If `x = 0` (perfect fit), `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(0))` = `1 / 2` = 0.5.
    # If `x > 0` (more capacity), `exp(k*x)` is larger, `priority` is smaller.
    # If `x < 0` (invalid bin), `exp(k*x)` is smaller, `priority` is larger.

    # We must handle invalid bins explicitly.
    # Define `k` as a parameter affecting the "tightness" of the fit.
    k_tightness = 3.0  # Higher k means tighter fit preference

    # Calculate the "slack" or "waste" in each bin: remaining capacity minus item size.
    slack = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priorities to 0 (for bins that are too small).
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Find the indices of bins that have enough remaining capacity to fit the item.
    can_fit_mask = slack >= 0

    # For bins that can fit, calculate their priority.
    # We want higher priority for smaller slack values.
    # Use the sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`.
    # We need to map `slack` to `z` such that:
    # - `slack = 0` (perfect fit) maps to a high priority.
    # - `slack` increasing maps to priority decreasing.

    # Let's use `z = -k_tightness * slack`.
    # For `slack = 0`, `z = 0`, `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
    # For `slack > 0`, `z < 0`, `sigmoid(z) < 0.5`.
    # For `slack < 0`, `z > 0`, `sigmoid(z) > 0.5`.

    # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * slack))` is better for decreasing priority.
    # It ranges from (0, 1) as slack goes from inf to -inf.
    # At `slack = 0`, score = 0.5.
    # At `slack > 0`, score < 0.5.
    # At `slack < 0`, score > 0.5.

    # So, apply this to `can_fit_mask` bins:
    # Use `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k_tightness * slack[can_fit_mask]))`
    # This yields priorities in (0, 0.5] for valid bins.
    # To get it into [0, 1] with a peak of 1 at slack=0, we can transform.

    # A common mapping for "best fit" that resembles a sigmoid:
    # Maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` for valid bins.
    # Map this to a sigmoid-like score.

    # Let's use the logistic function `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.
    # We want to set `x` such that for valid bins (`slack >= 0`),
    # the priority is high when `slack` is small.
    # Let `x = k_tightness * (-(bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # For valid bins: `x = k_tightness * (item - bins_remain_cap)`
    # If `slack = 0` (`bins_remain_cap = item`): `x = 0`, `priority = 0.5`.
    # If `slack > 0` (`bins_remain_cap > item`): `x < 0`, `priority < 0.5`.

    # This prioritizes bins with MORE remaining capacity when scaled by sigmoid.
    # The reverse mapping for descending priority:
    # `priority = 1 - 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` where `x` is an "error" or "badness"
    # Error `e = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # `priority = 1 - 1 / (1 + exp(-k_tightness * e))`
    # If `e = 0`, `priority = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.
    # If `e > 0`, `priority = 1 - (<0.5)` = `(>0.5)`. Wrong.

    # Let's reconsider the exponential decay form for "closeness"
    # `exp(-k * abs(slack))` is like a Gaussian.
    # `exp(-k * slack)` for slack >= 0.

    # Let's adopt a pragmatic approach based on common heuristic implementations:
    # Prioritize bins that leave the least waste.
    # The score is inversely related to `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Use `1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))` for valid bins.
    # This gives (0, 0.5] for valid bins.
    # To shift this to [0, 1] and peak at 1:
    # Add 0.5: `0.5 + 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # At slack=0: `0.5 + 0.5 = 1`.
    # At slack>0: `0.5 + (<0.5)` = `(<1)`.
    # This looks promising.

    # Ensure k_tightness is positive.
    if k_tightness <= 0:
        k_tightness = 1.0 # Default to a reasonable value if invalid

    # Calculate slack for all bins.
    slack = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priorities array.
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that can fit the item.
    can_fit_mask = slack >= 0

    # Calculate the core sigmoid-like score for fitting bins.
    # Using `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` where `x` should be larger for better fits.
    # Let `x = k_tightness * (-(slack))` which is `k_tightness * (item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # For `slack = 0`, `x=0`, score=0.5.
    # For `slack > 0`, `x < 0`, score < 0.5.

    # This is also not quite right if we want a peak at 1.

    # Let's consider the input `bins_remain_cap` and `item`.
    # The desired outcome is a high score when `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item`.
    # Use `f(c) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (c - item)))` where `c = bins_remain_cap`.
    # If `c = item`, `f = 0.5`.
    # If `c > item`, `f < 0.5`.
    # If `c < item`, `f > 0.5`.

    # Let's transform this output. We only care about `c >= item`.
    # Let `v = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (c - item)))`. For valid bins, `v` is in (0, 0.5].
    # We want to map `v=0.5` to `1` and `v->0` to `0`.
    # This is like inverting `0.5 + v` and then mapping to `[0,1]`.
    # `priority = 2 * v` is problematic (range (0, 1]).

    # How about `priority = 1 - (item / bins_remain_cap)` for bins that fit?
    # If `item=5`, `bins_remain_cap=5`, priority = `1-1=0`. WRONG.
    # If `item=5`, `bins_remain_cap=10`, priority = `1-0.5=0.5`.

    # Final strategy:
    # We want to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity.
    # Metric: `bins_remain_cap - item`. We want to minimize this non-negative value.
    # Use `priority = sigmoid(gain * (ideal - current))`
    # `ideal = item`
    # `current = bins_remain_cap`
    # `gain` relates to steepness.
    # A function `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # Input `x = k * (item - bins_remain_cap)`.
    # If `item == bins_remain_cap`, `x=0`, score=0.5.
    # If `item < bins_remain_cap`, `x<0`, score<0.5.
    # If `item > bins_remain_cap`, `x>0`, score>0.5.

    # This prioritizes bins with *more* capacity, not less.

    # Let's try to model the *probability of being the best fit*.
    # Best fit means minimizing `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Use `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))` where the sigmoid maps input `z` to `(0,1)`.
    # We want high priority when `item - bins_remain_cap` is `0` or negative.

    # Let's use the inverse of a decreasing function of `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # A good function is `exp(-k * slack)`. It's 1 at slack=0, and decays.
    # Let's map this to the (0, 1) range of a sigmoid if needed.
    # `sigmoid(log(exp(-k*slack) / (1-exp(-k*slack))))`

    # A robust choice that uses sigmoid properties:
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))` for `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # This gives scores in `(0, 0.5]`.
    # To map to `[0, 1]` and peak at `1` when `bins_remain_cap == item`:
    # Add `0.5`: `0.5 + 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # This maps `0.5` to `1` and `0` to `0.5`.
    # Let's ensure it goes up to 1.
    # For bins with `bins_remain_cap` far greater than `item`, the second term goes to 0.
    # So the score goes to `0.5`. We want it to approach 0 for very large slacks.

    # A simple transformation:
    # For valid bins (`bins_remain_cap >= item`):
    # Score = `exp(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # Scale this to `[0, 1]` if necessary.
    # This gives a value that decays exponentially.

    # Let's use the common sigmoid form `1 / (1 + exp(-z))`.
    # We want high priority for low `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # So we want `z` to be high when `slack` is low.
    # Let `z = k * (-slack)`.
    # For valid bins (`slack >= 0`):
    # `z` will be 0 or negative.
    # If `slack=0`, `z=0`, score = 0.5.
    # If `slack > 0`, `z < 0`, score < 0.5.

    # To get a peak of 1 at `slack=0`, we can use `1 - sigmoid(k * slack)`.
    # This gives `1 - sigmoid(0) = 0.5` for `slack=0`.
    # And `1 - sigmoid(positive)` = `1 - (>0.5)` = `(<0.5)` for `slack > 0`.

    # Let's use a robust approach to get a peak of 1 for `slack=0`.
    # For valid bins, `priority = exp(-k * slack)`. This is already a decaying function.
    # Let's scale it.
    # The maximum value is 1 when slack=0.
    # This is already in the `[0, 1]` range.

    # Let's use `exp(-k * slack)` but transform to sigmoid form.
    # Let `y = exp(-k * slack)`.
    # We want to map `y` (which is in `(0, 1]`) to a priority.
    # The priority should be `y` itself if we accept the exponential decay.

    # If we MUST use sigmoid form `1/(1+exp(-z))`.
    # Let `priority = 1/(1+exp(-z))`.
    # For `slack=0`, we want priority=1. `1/(1+exp(-z)) = 1` implies `exp(-z)=0`, which is not possible.
    # If we want priority approaching 1. Let `z` be large positive.
    # This means `-k * slack` must be large positive. So `k` negative and `slack` positive.

    # A common interpretation of "sigmoid fit score" for bin packing
    # is to prioritize bins that leave the *least* amount of residual space.
    # This is the "Best Fit" heuristic.
    # We want to maximize `P(bin | item)` where `P` is high for bins with small `bins_remain_cap - item`.

    # A simple implementation of this using sigmoid:
    # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # This score for valid bins is in `(0, 0.5]`.
    # We can map this to `[0, 1]` by `2 * score`.
    # So, `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 2.0 * (1 / (1 + np.exp(k_tightness * slack[can_fit_mask])))`
    # At slack=0: `2.0 * 0.5 = 1.0`.
    # At slack > 0: `2.0 * (<0.5)` = `(<1.0)`.
    # This is a valid interpretation and implementation.

    # Let's use this form.
    k_sigmoid_fit = 4.0 # Higher k means preference for tighter fits

    # Calculate slack: how much capacity is left after putting the item in.
    slack = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priorities to zero.
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Find bins that have enough capacity.
    can_fit_mask = slack >= 0

    # For bins that can fit, calculate their priority using the sigmoid form.
    # The expression `1 / (1 + exp(k * slack))` ranges from (0, 0.5] for slack >= 0.
    # We multiply by 2 to scale the range to (0, 1] and peak at 1.
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = 2.0 * (1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(k_sigmoid_fit * slack[can_fit_mask])))

    # Ensure priorities are not exactly zero unless the bin cannot fit.
    # Small positive values are fine for bins that fit.
    # The sigmoid output `1 / (1 + exp(k*slack))` is strictly positive for finite inputs.
    # The `2.0 * ...` multiplication ensures it's also strictly positive.

    return priorities
