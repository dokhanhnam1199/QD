Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Exploration-Exploitation, Diversification, Intensification, Robustness, Efficiency.
*   **Advice:** Focus on mechanisms that actively balance exploring novel solution spaces with exploiting promising areas. Design mechanisms to foster diversity within a search population.
*   **Avoid:** Passive or purely greedy exploration, neglecting potential for premature convergence, and overlooking edge cases that break numerical stability.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection should identify *why* a heuristic might fail (e.g., getting stuck in local optima) and proactively design mechanisms (like simulated annealing or adaptive random restarts) to mitigate these weaknesses, leading to more robust and efficient exploration.
