This is a more sophisticated attempt at balancing exploration and exploitation than Heuristic 1's fixed diversification bonus.\n\nComparing Heuristics 2 and 3: Heuristic 3 refines the adaptive strategy by making the \"beta\" parameter (controlling Softmax sharpness) adaptive to the mean slack. It also explicitly handles near-perfect fits with a bonus, which is a valuable addition for reducing fragmentation.\n\nComparing Heuristics 3 and 4: Heuristic 4 introduces a \"penalty for overly full bins\" and a stronger \"bonus for perfect fits\" using a scaled sigmoid. It's more complex than Heuristic 3's adaptive beta but might over-penalize tight fits.\n\nComparing Heuristics 4 and 5: Heuristic 5 is a basic \"Softmax-Based Fit\" and lacks the adaptive or penalty mechanisms of Heuristics 3 and 4. It's a good baseline but less sophisticated.\n\nComparing Heuristics 5 and 6: Heuristic 6 is very similar to Heuristic 5, essentially a cleaner implementation of Softmax-Based Fit with slightly better handling of edge cases (e.g., all scores being identical).\n\nComparing Heuristics 6 and 7: Heuristic 7 introduces a \"perfect fit bonus\" and uses \"inverse proximity\" for non-perfect fits. This is simpler than Heuristic 3's adaptive beta but explicitly rewards perfect fits, which is beneficial. However, its scaling might be less nuanced than Heuristic 3's adaptive beta.\n\nComparing Heuristics 7 and 19: Heuristic 19 attempts a more complex balance between \"Best Fit\" and \"Worst Fit\" using an adaptive `epsilon` based on variance. This is a sophisticated attempt at balancing exploration and exploitation. Heuristic 7's \"perfect fit bonus\" is more direct.\n\nComparing Heuristics 19 and 20: Heuristics 19 and 20 are identical.\n\nComparing Heuristics 2 and 10: Heuristic 10 combines \"Best Fit\" with a \"diversification bonus\" proportional to remaining capacity, aiming to balance fitting tightly and spreading items. This is a more direct approach to diversification than Heuristic 2's variance-based method.\n\nComparing Heuristics 10 and 11-15: Heuristics 11-15 are all very similar, implementing a basic \"inverse remaining capacity\" heuristic, often without Softmax normalization or sophisticated adaptive strategies. They are simple but potentially less robust than Softmax-based approaches.\n\nComparing Heuristics 11-15 and 16-18: Heuristics 16-18 use `np.exp(effective_capacities)` which is essentially a form of Softmax but without explicit negative scaling for Best Fit. This might prioritize larger remaining capacities too much.\n\nOverall: Heuristics that dynamically adjust parameters (like beta or epsilon) based on the current state (variance, slack) and explicitly handle \"perfect fits\" tend to be better. The complexity in Heuristics 3, 4, and 19/20 suggests a trend towards more adaptive and nuanced scoring. Simple inversions (Heuristics 11-15) are generally less effective.\n- \nHere's a redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\" focused on designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Parameters, Hybridization, Reward Structures, Numerical Stability.\n*   **Advice:** Design adaptive strategies that dynamically tune parameters based on problem characteristics (e.g., variance, resource slack) to balance exploitation and exploration.
