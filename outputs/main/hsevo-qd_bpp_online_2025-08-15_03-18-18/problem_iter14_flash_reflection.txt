**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1 and 5: Heuristic 1 uses `-(valid_bins_remain_cap - item)` as its base score, which directly implements the "Best Fit" principle by maximizing this value (minimizing waste). Heuristic 5 also uses this, but adds robustness checks for identical scores and zero sums, making it slightly more stable.

Comparing Heuristics 2 and 6: Both introduce an "adaptive diversification" component. Heuristic 2 uses variance to adjust the score, aiming to diversify when variance is low. Heuristic 6 refines this by adding a specific "perfect fit bonus" and a more complex adaptive diversification score tied to relative variance, making it more nuanced.

Comparing Heuristics 3 and 4: Heuristic 3 attempts to balance "Best Fit" with a tendency to favor less full bins based on overall bin capacity spread. It introduces a `spread_factor` and `relative_remaining_cap`. Heuristic 4 introduces an adaptive temperature parameter for Softmax, controlled by the number of valid bins and their standard deviation, along with a diversity bonus. Heuristic 4's adaptive temperature is a more sophisticated mechanism for controlling exploration/exploitation.

Comparing Heuristics 7 and 20: Heuristic 7 is identical to Heuristic 5. Heuristic 20 introduces a blend of "Best Fit" and "Worst Fit" tendencies, adapting the balance using an `epsilon` parameter derived from the variance of remaining capacities. This adaptive blending is a strong strategy for managing exploration vs. exploitation.

Comparing Heuristics 9-16 (repeated implementations of `1 / (potential_fits + epsilon)`) with Heuristics 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 20: The latter group uses more sophisticated scoring mechanisms, often involving combinations of factors (Best Fit, diversification, adaptive elements) and applying Softmax for probabilistic selection. Heuristics 9-16 are simple, potentially prone to extreme values and don't incorporate adaptive strategies or explicit diversification. Heuristic 17-19 use `np.exp(effective_capacities)` which would disproportionately favor bins with very large remaining capacities, not necessarily ideal for packing efficiency.

Overall: Heuristics 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 20 demonstrate a progression towards more complex, adaptive, and robust strategies. Heuristics 20, 4, and 6 appear to be the most advanced, incorporating adaptive parameters (temperature, epsilon) and multi-faceted scoring. Heuristics 1, 5, and 7 represent a solid "Best Fit" baseline with Softmax. Heuristics 9-16 are simplistic and less effective. Heuristics 17-19 have an unusual scoring mechanism.

**Experience:**
Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple objectives (e.g., Best Fit, diversification) with adaptive mechanisms (e.g., temperature, epsilon based on state). Softmax is a good choice for generating probabilities. Avoid overly simplistic scoring functions and ensure numerical stability. Testing and tuning weights/parameters are crucial.
