**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1 and 2: Heuristic 2 introduces an "adaptive diversification" component based on the variance of remaining capacities. This is a more sophisticated attempt at balancing exploration and exploitation than Heuristic 1's fixed diversification bonus.

Comparing Heuristics 2 and 3: Heuristic 3 refines the adaptive strategy by making the "beta" parameter (controlling Softmax sharpness) adaptive to the mean slack. It also explicitly handles near-perfect fits with a bonus, which is a valuable addition for reducing fragmentation.

Comparing Heuristics 3 and 4: Heuristic 4 introduces a "penalty for overly full bins" and a stronger "bonus for perfect fits" using a scaled sigmoid. It's more complex than Heuristic 3's adaptive beta but might over-penalize tight fits.

Comparing Heuristics 4 and 5: Heuristic 5 is a basic "Softmax-Based Fit" and lacks the adaptive or penalty mechanisms of Heuristics 3 and 4. It's a good baseline but less sophisticated.

Comparing Heuristics 5 and 6: Heuristic 6 is very similar to Heuristic 5, essentially a cleaner implementation of Softmax-Based Fit with slightly better handling of edge cases (e.g., all scores being identical).

Comparing Heuristics 6 and 7: Heuristic 7 introduces a "perfect fit bonus" and uses "inverse proximity" for non-perfect fits. This is simpler than Heuristic 3's adaptive beta but explicitly rewards perfect fits, which is beneficial. However, its scaling might be less nuanced than Heuristic 3's adaptive beta.

Comparing Heuristics 7 and 19: Heuristic 19 attempts a more complex balance between "Best Fit" and "Worst Fit" using an adaptive `epsilon` based on variance. This is a sophisticated attempt at balancing exploration and exploitation. Heuristic 7's "perfect fit bonus" is more direct.

Comparing Heuristics 19 and 20: Heuristics 19 and 20 are identical.

Comparing Heuristics 2 and 10: Heuristic 10 combines "Best Fit" with a "diversification bonus" proportional to remaining capacity, aiming to balance fitting tightly and spreading items. This is a more direct approach to diversification than Heuristic 2's variance-based method.

Comparing Heuristics 10 and 11-15: Heuristics 11-15 are all very similar, implementing a basic "inverse remaining capacity" heuristic, often without Softmax normalization or sophisticated adaptive strategies. They are simple but potentially less robust than Softmax-based approaches.

Comparing Heuristics 11-15 and 16-18: Heuristics 16-18 use `np.exp(effective_capacities)` which is essentially a form of Softmax but without explicit negative scaling for Best Fit. This might prioritize larger remaining capacities too much.

Overall: Heuristics that dynamically adjust parameters (like beta or epsilon) based on the current state (variance, slack) and explicitly handle "perfect fits" tend to be better. The complexity in Heuristics 3, 4, and 19/20 suggests a trend towards more adaptive and nuanced scoring. Simple inversions (Heuristics 11-15) are generally less effective.

**Experience:**
Adaptive strategies that adjust parameters based on problem state (e.g., variance, slack) improve performance. Explicitly rewarding "perfect fits" is crucial for reducing fragmentation. Balancing "Best Fit" with diversification/exploration is key for robust heuristics. Avoid overly simplistic scoring mechanisms.
