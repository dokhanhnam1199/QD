Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Probabilistic, Hybrid, Robustness.
*   **Advice:** Focus on adaptive parameter tuning for dynamic exploration-exploitation balance, leverage normalized probabilistic selection (e.g., Softmax with careful scaling) for diverse yet informed choices, and integrate hybrid strategies that blend greedy exploitation with systematic exploration.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic selection mechanisms (e.g., pure greedy), fixed parameter settings, and heuristics that don't account for edge cases like perfect fits or numerical instability.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection identifies *how* to dynamically adapt heuristic behavior to problem characteristics, moving beyond static rules to create more generalizable and performant solutions.
