Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Heuristic 5 also uses this, but adds robustness checks for identical scores and zero sums, making it slightly more stable.\n\nComparing Heuristics 2 and 6: Both introduce an \"adaptive diversification\" component. Heuristic 2 uses variance to adjust the score, aiming to diversify when variance is low. Heuristic 6 refines this by adding a specific \"perfect fit bonus\" and a more complex adaptive diversification score tied to relative variance, making it more nuanced.\n\nComparing Heuristics 3 and 4: Heuristic 3 attempts to balance \"Best Fit\" with a tendency to favor less full bins based on overall bin capacity spread. It introduces a `spread_factor` and `relative_remaining_cap`. Heuristic 4 introduces an adaptive temperature parameter for Softmax, controlled by the number of valid bins and their standard deviation, along with a diversity bonus. Heuristic 4's adaptive temperature is a more sophisticated mechanism for controlling exploration/exploitation.\n\nComparing Heuristics 7 and 20: Heuristic 7 is identical to Heuristic 5. Heuristic 20 introduces a blend of \"Best Fit\" and \"Worst Fit\" tendencies, adapting the balance using an `epsilon` parameter derived from the variance of remaining capacities. This adaptive blending is a strong strategy for managing exploration vs. exploitation.\n\nComparing Heuristics 9-16 (repeated implementations of `1 / (potential_fits + epsilon)`) with Heuristics 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 20: The latter group uses more sophisticated scoring mechanisms, often involving combinations of factors (Best Fit, diversification, adaptive elements) and applying Softmax for probabilistic selection. Heuristics 9-16 are simple, potentially prone to extreme values and don't incorporate adaptive strategies or explicit diversification. Heuristic 17-19 use `np.exp(effective_capacities)` which would disproportionately favor bins with very large remaining capacities, not necessarily ideal for packing efficiency.\n\nOverall: Heuristics 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 20 demonstrate a progression towards more complex, adaptive, and robust strategies. Heuristics 20, 4, and 6 appear to be the most advanced, incorporating adaptive parameters (temperature, epsilon) and multi-faceted scoring. Heuristics 1, 5, and 7 represent a solid \"Best Fit\" baseline with Softmax. Heuristics 9-16 are simplistic and less effective. Heuristics 17-19 have an unusual scoring mechanism.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Adaptive, Probabilistic, Hybridization.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that integrate multiple criteria (e.g., fit quality, diversity) and dynamically adjust their behavior based on problem instance characteristics. Leverage robust probabilistic selection methods like Softmax with careful parameterization.\n*   **Avoid:** Simplistic, static scoring functions, neglecting numerical stability, and overly complex, untuned adaptive mechanisms.\n*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create intelligent, flexible heuristics that balance exploration and exploitation by understanding and responding to the problem's evolving state, ensuring both efficiency and robustness.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
