{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nFor better heuristics:\n1.  Prioritize robust score normalization (e.g., Softmax) for probability-based selection.\n2.  Consider hybrid approaches that balance greedy choices with exploration (e.g., weighted random).\n3.  Explicitly handle perfect fits for maximum efficiency.\n4.  Ensure numerical stability by avoiding division by zero and handling potential overflows.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
