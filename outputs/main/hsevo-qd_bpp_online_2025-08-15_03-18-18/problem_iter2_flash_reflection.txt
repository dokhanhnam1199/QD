**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1-3 (Softmax-based) with Heuristics 4-12 (Inverse proximity): The primary difference is the approach to score normalization. Heuristics 1-3 use Softmax, which converts scores into a probability distribution, ensuring that the sum of priorities is 1. This is generally a more robust approach for selection mechanisms that expect probabilities. Heuristics 4-12 use a simpler inverse proximity score, which can lead to very large or very small values and doesn't inherently normalize the probabilities.

Comparing Heuristics 1-3 with Heuristics 17-20 (Exponentiated effective capacities): Heuristics 17-20 use `np.exp(effective_capacities)` directly. While this also amplifies the preference for better fits, it doesn't normalize the output in the same way as Softmax. If all effective capacities are large and positive, the resulting priorities can become extremely large, potentially causing numerical issues. Softmax, by subtracting the max before exponentiation, mitigates this. The fallback to `np.ones_like(...) / len(...)` if the sum is zero is an interesting edge case handling in 17-20.

Comparing Heuristics 1-3 with Heuristics 13-16 (epsilon-weighted random + greedy): These heuristics introduce a random element, balancing exploration (random scores) with exploitation (greedy scores). The weighting factor `epsilon` controls this balance. This is a more sophisticated approach than purely greedy or purely Softmax-based methods, as it can help escape local optima and discover better packing configurations over time.

Comparing Heuristics 4-7 with Heuristics 8-12: Heuristics 8-12 introduce a special case for perfect fits (`remaining_cap == item`), assigning them a priority of 1.0. This is a sensible addition that directly rewards perfect utilization of bin space. Heuristics 4-7 and 9 also use `1.0 / (potential_fits + 1e-9)`, but they miss this explicit perfect-fit handling.

Comparing Heuristics 4-7, 9 with Heuristics 5-7, 9: These are identical. They represent a basic "best fit" heuristic where the priority is inversely proportional to the remaining space after placing the item. The addition of `1e-9` is a good practice to avoid division by zero.

Comparing Heuristics 1-3 and 17-20 with Heuristics 4-16: The Softmax-based (1-3) and exponential (17-20) approaches offer a more nuanced distribution of priorities compared to the simple inverse proximity (4-16). The Softmax approach in 1-3 is generally preferred over the raw exponential in 17-20 due to better numerical stability and explicit probability interpretation. The combination of greedy and random in 13-16 adds an element of exploration which can be beneficial.

Overall: The Softmax-based approach (1-3) offers a good balance of exploitation and robustness. The hybrid greedy-random approach (13-16) is a strong contender for its exploration capability. The explicit perfect-fit handling (8-12) is a valuable refinement.

**Experience:**
For better heuristics:
1.  Prioritize robust score normalization (e.g., Softmax) for probability-based selection.
2.  Consider hybrid approaches that balance greedy choices with exploration (e.g., weighted random).
3.  Explicitly handle perfect fits for maximum efficiency.
4.  Ensure numerical stability by avoiding division by zero and handling potential overflows.
