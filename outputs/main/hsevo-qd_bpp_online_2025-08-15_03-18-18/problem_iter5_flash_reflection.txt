**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Best) vs. Heuristic 10 (Worst): Heuristic 1 uses a more sophisticated approach by combining "Best Fit" with a diversification penalty, and then applying Softmax for probability distribution. Heuristic 10 is a simple "inverse proximity" (Best Fit) without normalization or diversification.

Comparing Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 2: Heuristic 1 employs a hybrid strategy with a penalty for overly full bins, while Heuristic 2 focuses on perfect fits and inverse proximity. Both use Softmax, but Heuristic 1's diversification penalty is a more nuanced approach to avoid premature bin exhaustion.

Comparing Heuristic 2 vs. Heuristic 3: Heuristic 2 explicitly rewards perfect fits with a bonus, whereas Heuristic 3 only implicitly favors tighter fits through its base score calculation. Heuristic 2's direct reward for perfect fits is a stronger signal for that specific good outcome.

Comparing Heuristic 3 vs. Heuristic 11: Both focus on inverse proximity. Heuristic 11 adds a specific high priority for perfect fits, making it more explicit about rewarding exact matches, which can be beneficial.

Comparing Heuristic 11 vs. Heuristic 14: These are nearly identical, both prioritizing perfect fits and then using inverse proximity. The subtle difference in variable naming doesn't significantly alter behavior.

Comparing Heuristic 14 vs. Heuristic 12: Heuristic 14 explicitly handles perfect fits separately before applying inverse proximity, while Heuristic 12 directly applies inverse proximity (which handles perfect fits as a limit). Heuristic 14's explicit handling might be slightly more robust for edge cases or clarity.

Comparing Heuristic 12 vs. Heuristic 15: Heuristic 12 directly applies `1 / (remaining_capacity - item + 1e-9)` to valid bins. Heuristic 15 does the same but appears to have a static `bin_capacities = 1.0` which might be a placeholder and not used, making it functionally similar to Heuristic 12 if `bins_remain_cap` are already calculated differences. The use of `potential_fits` is cleaner.

Comparing Heuristic 15 vs. Heuristic 10: Both use the inverse proximity strategy. Heuristic 15 uses `potential_fits` and a mask, which is slightly more idiomatic NumPy than the explicit loop in Heuristic 10.

Comparing Heuristic 18/19 vs. Heuristic 20: Heuristics 18/19 use `exp(effective_capacities)` which rewards larger remaining capacities (more "open" bins). Heuristic 20 attempts a more complex adaptive strategy combining "goodness of fit" and "openness," but its implementation might be overly complex or sensitive to parameter tuning. Heuristic 18/19's simplicity in rewarding openness is clear.

Comparing Heuristic 20 vs. Heuristic 1: Heuristic 1 is a more balanced and interpretable hybrid, directly penalizing overly tight fits. Heuristic 20's adaptive strategy with "epsilon" and scaled exponentials is more complex and potentially harder to tune effectively for general cases.

Overall: More complex heuristics that combine multiple objectives (like Best Fit + Diversification) and use Softmax for normalization generally perform better (Heuristics 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 20). Simple inverse proximity is decent but less robust (Heuristics 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). Reward for perfect fits is a good addition (Heuristics 2, 11, 14).

**Experience:**
Prioritize heuristics that combine multiple desirable properties (e.g., best fit, avoiding over-filling, perfect fits). Softmax normalization improves selection diversity. Simple inverse proximity is a baseline, but complex hybrids often yield better results by balancing exploitation and exploration. Avoid overly complex, un-tuned adaptive strategies.
