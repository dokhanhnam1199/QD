Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focused on designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Parameters, Hybridization, Reward Structures, Numerical Stability.
*   **Advice:** Design adaptive strategies that dynamically tune parameters based on problem characteristics (e.g., variance, resource slack) to balance exploitation and exploration. Integrate hybrid selection mechanisms that combine greedy "best fit" with probabilistic diversification.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simple scoring, ignoring perfect fits, fragile parameter tuning, and neglecting numerical precision.
*   **Explanation:** This approach emphasizes sophisticated, state-aware adaptation and balanced selection, drawing from robust techniques like Softmax and explicitly valuing efficient solutions (perfect fits) while ensuring computational reliability.
