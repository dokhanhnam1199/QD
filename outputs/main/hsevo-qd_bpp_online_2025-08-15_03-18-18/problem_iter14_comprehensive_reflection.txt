Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, Adaptive, Probabilistic, Hybridization.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that integrate multiple criteria (e.g., fit quality, diversity) and dynamically adjust their behavior based on problem instance characteristics. Leverage robust probabilistic selection methods like Softmax with careful parameterization.
*   **Avoid:** Simplistic, static scoring functions, neglecting numerical stability, and overly complex, untuned adaptive mechanisms.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create intelligent, flexible heuristics that balance exploration and exploitation by understanding and responding to the problem's evolving state, ensuring both efficiency and robustness.
