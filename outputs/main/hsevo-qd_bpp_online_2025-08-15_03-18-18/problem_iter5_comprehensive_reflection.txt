Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive hybridization, Pareto fronts, meta-learning, sensitivity analysis.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that adapt their strategies based on problem instance characteristics or performance feedback, rather than static combinations. Explore methods to identify and exploit "sweet spots" where certain heuristic components are most effective.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly applying pre-defined hybrid strategies without understanding their impact on diverse problem instances. Over-reliance on single-objective optimization without considering trade-offs between conflicting goals.
*   **Explanation:** True improvement comes from dynamic, data-informed adjustments, not just static mixing. Understanding how heuristic parameters or component choices affect outcomes across a spectrum of problems (like using sensitivity analysis or exploring Pareto fronts of heuristic properties) leads to more robust and performant designs.
