{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nAdaptive strategies that adjust parameters based on problem state (e.g., variance, slack) improve performance. Explicitly rewarding \"perfect fits\" is crucial for reducing fragmentation. Balancing \"Best Fit\" with diversification/exploration is key for robust heuristics. Avoid overly simplistic scoring mechanisms.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nFor better heuristics:\n1.  Prioritize robust score normalization (e.g., Softmax) for probability-based selection.\n2.  Consider hybrid approaches that balance greedy choices with exploration (e.g., weighted random).\n3.  Explicitly handle perfect fits for maximum efficiency.\n4.  Ensure numerical stability by avoiding division by zero and handling potential overflows.\n\nPrioritize heuristics that combine multiple desirable properties (e.g., best fit, avoiding over-filling, perfect fits). Softmax normalization improves selection diversity. Simple inverse proximity is a baseline, but complex hybrids often yield better results by balancing exploitation and exploration. Avoid overly complex, un-tuned adaptive strategies.\n\n*   Hybrid strategies combining Best Fit (exploitation) with diversification (exploration) are generally superior.\n*   Softmax normalization, especially with score shifting and appropriate scaling, provides robust probabilistic selection.\n*   Adaptive parameters (like `epsilon` based on variance) can significantly improve performance by dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation.\n*   Explicit handling of perfect fits and numerical stability is crucial for robust heuristics.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
