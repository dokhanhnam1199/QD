**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates inverse distance, node degree penalty, and variance-based normalization with safeguards against division by zero and NaN/Inf values, while the worst heuristic only uses inverse distance.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), heuristics (19th) is the same with (20th).

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the top two are exactly the same. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) ...Comparing (5th) vs (1st), all of them are the same.

Comparing (6th) vs (1st), the 6th version adds parameters `zero_replacement_value`, `std_replacement_value`, and `nan_replacement_value`, allowing more control over handling edge cases. This is an improvement. Comparing (7th) vs (6th)...Comparing (10th) vs (6th), all of them are the same.

Comparing (11th) vs (6th), the 11th is simplified by removing parameters.

Comparing (16th) vs (11th), we see the 16th version introduces sparsification and edge sharpening based on node mean heuristic values, followed by normalization across rows and columns using sums instead of standard deviations. This aims to emphasize promising edges and reduce noise.

Comparing (17th) vs (16th)...Comparing (18th) vs (16th), all of them are the same.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more sophisticated techniques like node degree penalty, variance-based normalization, and edge sharpening/sparsification to improve the quality of the heuristic matrix. The worst heuristics rely only on the inverse distance, which is a very basic approach.

**Experience:**

More sophisticated heuristics can be designed by combining multiple factors, such as distance, node degree, and normalization techniques. Adding parameters to control edge case handling can improve robustness. Sharpening edge scores, node degree penalties and sparsification may lead to better performance by focusing search efforts on more promising areas.
