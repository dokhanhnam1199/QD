- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine our self-reflection to design better heuristics, aiming for actionable insights:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, multi-factor integration, robustness, computational efficiency, parameter tuning, search space focusing.

*   **Advice:** Systematically experiment with combining diverse features (distance, degree, etc.). Quantify the impact of each addition on both solution quality and runtime. Explicitly design for edge cases and numerical stability.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting computational cost analysis.

*   **Explanation:** This approach encourages data-driven design, balancing complexity and efficiency, while ensuring generalizability through parameter tuning and careful consideration of edge cases.
