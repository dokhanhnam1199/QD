- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of generic advice.

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial analysis, Adaptive parameters, Edge case robustness, Search space focusing.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by integrating diverse factors (distance, node features, problem-specific attributes) with adaptive parameters tuned by feedback during the search.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic "consider normalization" or "handle edge cases" without specifying *how* or *why* within the specific heuristic context.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves critically evaluating *how* design choices (factor combinations, parameter settings) impact heuristic performance across different problem instances and adapting those choices accordingly.
