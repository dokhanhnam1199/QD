**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (14th), we see the best heuristic incorporates inverse distance, node degree penalty, and variance-based normalization, while the worst only uses inverse distance. (8th) vs (15th) reinforces this. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the top 3 heuristics are functionally identical. (4th) vs (5th) and (6th) vs (7th) also show identical functionality, merely differing in added (unused) imports. (16th) vs (14th), the 16th introduces node degree penalty and sparsification, edge sharpening. Comparing (8th) vs (14th), the 8th heuristic incorporates node degree penalty and variance based normalization. Comparing (13th) vs (14th), the 13th includes node degree penalty, and sparsification with edge sharpening. Comparing (16th) vs (14th), we see that the 16th includes node degree penalty, sparsification and edge sharpening. Comparing (16th) vs (13th), the 16th has exposed parameters. Comparing (13th) vs (8th), the 13th has edge sharpening and sparsification, normalization. Overall: Better heuristics combine inverse distance with node degree penalty and normalization techniques. Sparsification and edge sharpening may further enhance performance.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, start with basic components (e.g., inverse distance) and iteratively add complexity (e.g., node degree penalty, normalization, sparsification). Expose critical parameters for tuning to improve generalizability. Always consider computational cost vs. solution quality.
