- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, steering clear of ineffective practices:

*   **Keywords:** Comprehensive analysis, robustification, edge-case handling, multi-faceted evaluation.
*   **Advice:** Actively question initial assumptions. Explore diverse heuristic parameters and combinations. Stress-test heuristics with varied datasets. Quantify improvements systematically.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization on limited datasets. Over-reliance on intuition without empirical validation. Ignoring potential failure modes or boundary conditions.
*   **Explanation:** Current self-reflection should involve broad exploration, rigorous testing, and awareness of limitations, ensuring robustness across diverse scenarios.
