**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic incorporates inverse distance, node degree penalty, and variance-based normalization, while the worst only uses inverse distance. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see that all heuristics from 1st to 10th have the complete implementation, while from 11th to 20th, they only return inverse distance. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th), etc., we see that they are identical, suggesting no performance difference among the top 10. Comparing (11th) vs (20th), they are also identical, implying no performance difference among the bottom 10. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no difference, as both return 1/distance_matrix. Overall: The best heuristic uses inverse distance, node degree penalty and normalization, while the worst only uses inverse distance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors beyond just the most obvious one. Normalization and node degree penalties can significantly improve performance. Remember to handle edge cases like division by zero and NaN/Inf values for numerical stability.
