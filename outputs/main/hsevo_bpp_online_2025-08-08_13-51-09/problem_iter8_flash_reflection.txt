**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Best) vs Heuristic 2 (Worst): Heuristic 1 calculates complex priority scores considering tightness and consolidation, aiming for nuanced bin selection. Heuristic 2 directly implements a Best Fit strategy by setting the priority of the single best-fit bin to 1 and others to 0, which is a deterministic choice rather than a nuanced priority.

Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 3: Heuristic 1 focuses on minimizing remaining space and encouraging consolidation with a weighted sum. Heuristic 3 also combines "Best Fit" with favoring larger bins, but its normalization approach and combination might be less robust than Heuristic 1's focus on tightness.

Comparing Heuristic 3 vs Heuristic 4 (identical): Both use "Best Fit" and "favor larger bins" with similar normalization and weighting.

Comparing Heuristic 3 vs Heuristic 5 (identical): Same as above.

Comparing Heuristic 5 vs Heuristic 6: Heuristic 5 combines "Best Fit" with "favor larger bins" using normalization and weights. Heuristic 6 uses "tight fit" and "diversification bonus" with a simpler inverse scaling for both, and normalizes the final combined scores. Heuristic 6's approach to diversification using inverse remaining capacity is a good addition.

Comparing Heuristic 6 vs Heuristic 7 (similar to 1): Heuristic 7 is very similar to Heuristic 1, focusing on tightness and consolidation. Heuristic 6's "diversification" metric offers a different angle.

Comparing Heuristic 7 vs Heuristic 8 (identical): These are identical to Heuristic 1.

Comparing Heuristic 8 vs Heuristic 9: Heuristic 8 (and its duplicates) focuses on tightness and consolidation. Heuristic 9 combines "Best Fit" with a sigmoid penalty for large remaining capacities, offering a smoother penalty. The sigmoid approach in Heuristic 9 is an interesting variation for managing large remaining spaces.

Comparing Heuristic 9 vs Heuristic 10: Heuristic 9 uses a sigmoid penalty. Heuristic 10 balances "Best Fit" with "emptiness" using a log transformation, aiming to distribute items more evenly. The log transformation for emptiness in Heuristic 10 is a novel approach for diversification.

Comparing Heuristic 10 vs Heuristic 11 (identical): Both balance "Best Fit" and "emptiness" using log transformation.

Comparing Heuristic 11 vs Heuristic 12 (identical): Same as above.

Comparing Heuristic 12 vs Heuristic 13 (incomplete): Heuristic 13 is cut off and only initializes variables without logic.

Comparing Heuristic 13 vs Heuristic 14 (identical, incomplete): Same as Heuristic 13.

Comparing Heuristic 14 vs Heuristic 15: Heuristic 15 combines "Best Fit" (tight packing) with an "exploration bonus" using normalized remaining capacity. It uses a reciprocal for tight fit and min-max scaling for exploration. This is a more refined version of balancing fit and exploration.

Comparing Heuristic 15 vs Heuristic 16: Heuristic 16 also combines "Best Fit" and an "exploration bonus," using inverse for best fit and min-max scaling of the bin capacity itself for exploration. Heuristic 15's exploration bonus is based on remaining capacity after placement, while Heuristic 16's is based on the absolute remaining capacity of suitable bins. Heuristic 16's use of `-np.inf` initialization is also a good practice for clarity.

Comparing Heuristic 16 vs Heuristic 17 (identical): Same as above.

Comparing Heuristic 17 vs Heuristic 18: Heuristic 18 is a more refined version of 16/17, with clearer variable naming and explicit handling of the single suitable bin case for exploration bonus. The normalization for exploration bonus is correctly applied to the capacity itself, not remaining after placement.

Comparing Heuristic 18 vs Heuristic 19: Heuristic 18 combines best-fit (inverse difference) with an exploration bonus based on normalized bin capacity. Heuristic 19 uses a weighted sum of best-fit (inverse difference) and an exploration bonus derived from min-max scaling of remaining capacity. Heuristic 19's exploration bonus based on remaining capacity is a better proxy for "less utilized" than absolute capacity.

Comparing Heuristic 19 vs Heuristic 20 (identical): Both combine best-fit and exploration bonus on remaining capacity with weighted sum.

Overall: The best heuristics (1, 7, 8) focus on minimizing remaining space and encouraging consolidation. The next tier (3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 19, 20) blend "Best Fit" with diversification/exploration strategies using various normalization and transformation techniques. Heuristics 2, 13, 14 are either too simplistic or incomplete. Heuristics 16, 17, 18 use a good approach for exploration bonus on bin capacity but might be slightly less nuanced than using remaining capacity after fit.

**Experience:**
Heuristics should balance primary objectives (e.g., tight fit) with secondary goals (e.g., diversification). Use robust normalization (min-max) and mathematical transformations (log, inverse) to create nuanced scores. Avoid overly simplistic or incomplete logic; prioritize clear metrics and well-defined combination strategies.
