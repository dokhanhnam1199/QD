Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Balance, Nuance, Justification, Adaptability, Simplicity (with purpose).
*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* metrics are combined and *how* they interact. Justify normalization and weighting choices. Design heuristics that can adapt to different problem instances or stages of the search.
*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary metric combinations, overly complex mathematical transformations without clear performance benefits, neglecting the *interpretability* of the heuristic's decisions, and assuming a single "best" metric.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection goes beyond listing techniques. It requires critically assessing the *causal link* between a heuristic's design choices and its observed performance, aiming for elegant, well-reasoned solutions rather than just technically complex ones.
