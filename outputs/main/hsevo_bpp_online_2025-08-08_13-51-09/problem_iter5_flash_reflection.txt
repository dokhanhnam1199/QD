**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1 and 6 (identical): Heuristic 1 uses a combination of inverse difference and inverse remaining capacity, aiming for tight fits and penalizing large gaps. Heuristic 6 is identical.

Comparing Heuristics 2 and 10: Heuristic 2 scales the inverse difference by the inverse of remaining capacity, penalizing large gaps. Heuristic 10 uses a sigmoid on the fit ratio and normalizes the inverse remaining capacity, then combines them. Heuristic 2 is simpler and likely less prone to issues with parameter tuning that affect Heuristic 10's performance.

Comparing Heuristics 3 and 17/18 (identical): Heuristic 3 uses an inverse difference and then normalizes it with a sigmoid, aiming for a normalized priority range. Heuristics 17 and 18 are identical to Heuristic 3 but include additional parameters for sigmoid control, potentially offering more fine-tuning but increasing complexity.

Comparing Heuristics 4 and 5: Heuristic 4 combines Best Fit with a sigmoid penalty for large remaining capacities, using multiplication for combination. Heuristic 5 uses a composite score involving inverse remaining capacity and a fill ratio, aiming for tighter fits and better utilization. Heuristic 5's approach of combining metrics in a weighted manner seems more robust than Heuristic 4's multiplication which can lead to zero scores.

Comparing Heuristics 7, 8 (identical) and 11, 12, 15, 16 (identical): These heuristics combine "Best Fit" with an exploration bonus for less full bins using an epsilon-greedy approach. They prioritize tight fits but also explore less full bins. The difference lies in how the exploration bonus is calculated: Heuristics 7/8 use a raw difference from the average, while 11/12/15/16 use min-max scaling for normalization, potentially offering better control.

Comparing Heuristics 9 and 13 (identical): Identical to 7/8, using an epsilon-greedy approach with mean-based exploration bonus.

Comparing Heuristics 14 and 15/16: These are similar to 7/8 but use min-max scaling for the exploration bonus, which is generally more robust than using the mean.

Comparing Heuristics 19 and 20 (identical): These heuristics combine Best Fit with scores for original capacity and a fullness penalty, then normalize. This multi-component approach aims for a balanced solution.

Overall: Heuristics that combine multiple criteria (like Best Fit with utilization or exploration) tend to be more sophisticated. Simple inverse relationships are a good baseline. Methods involving sigmoid normalization offer controlled ranges but introduce complexity. Exploration strategies (epsilon-greedy) add robustness. Heuristics 19/20 offer a well-rounded approach by combining several factors and normalizing.

**Experience:**
Prioritize clear, well-defined metrics for "tight fit" and "utilization." Combining multiple metrics with appropriate weighting and normalization can create more robust heuristics. Exploration strategies help avoid local optima. Simplicity is often a virtue, but consider metrics that capture nuanced aspects of bin packing.
