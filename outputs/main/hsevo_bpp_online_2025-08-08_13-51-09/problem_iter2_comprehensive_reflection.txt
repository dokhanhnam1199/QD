*   **Keywords:** Bin packing, heuristic design, local search, neighborhood exploration, diversification.
*   **Advice:** Focus on refining the *quality* of "tight fit" assessment by exploring diverse metrics beyond simple inverse relationships. Consider how different neighborhood structures in local search can expose novel packing solutions.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on fixed scaling functions. Avoid neglecting the impact of initial solutions; consider a diversification strategy for starting points.
*   **Explanation:** "Tight fit" can be multifaceted. Instead of just inverse relationships, explore metrics that capture volume utilization *and* adjacency benefits. Different local search neighborhoods explore different parts of the solution space, preventing getting stuck in poor local optima. Diverse starting points ensure a broader exploration.
