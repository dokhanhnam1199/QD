**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1 and 2 (identical): They implement three metrics: Best Fit, Gap Exploitation, and Bin Fill Similarity, with dynamic weighting based on item size relative to max suitable capacity. The weights adapt to prioritize Best Fit for larger items and Gap Exploitation/Fill Similarity for smaller ones. Normalization is applied to each metric before combining.

Comparing Heuristics 3 and 4: Heuristic 3 combines Best Fit (tightness) with Exploration (larger initial capacity) using a fixed weighted sum. Heuristic 4 combines Best Fit (negative remaining capacity) with Exploration (normalized remaining capacity) using a weighted sum, favoring Best Fit. Heuristic 3 normalizes component scores via min-max scaling, while Heuristic 4 uses direct combination.

Comparing Heuristics 5, 6, 7, 8 (identical): These heuristics also use Best Fit (relative remaining capacity), Bin Fullness (inverse of remaining capacity), and Item Size Ratio. They employ dynamic weighting based on the item's size relative to the average suitable bin capacity. The weights adapt to prioritize Best Fit and Fullness for larger items, and Item Ratio/Fullness for smaller items. Normalization is applied to each metric before weighted combination.

Comparing Heuristics 9 and 10, 11, 12 (identical): Heuristic 9 combines Best Fit (tightness) with a fairness penalty (deviation from average remaining capacity). Heuristics 10-12 combine Modified Best Fit (sweet spot residual), Exploration (normalized remaining capacity after placement), and Usage Proxy (normalized current remaining capacity) with fixed weights.

Comparing Heuristics 13, 14, 15 (identical): These combine Refined Best Fit (log1p of inverse residual) with Exploration (min-max scaled remaining capacity after placement), using dynamic weights based on item size relative to a threshold.

Comparing Heuristics 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (identical): These combine Best Fit (inverse residual) with Exploration (log1p or log of remaining capacity). They use fixed weights and normalize the combined score. Heuristics 17-18 have slightly different weights (0.55/0.45) than 19-20 (0.55/0.45) and 16 (0.7/0.3) for Best Fit vs. Exploration.

Overall: The best heuristics (1-8) tend to use multiple metrics and adapt their weighting dynamically based on item characteristics or bin states, often involving normalization of individual metrics or the final combined score. Simpler fixed-weight combinations of Best Fit and Exploration (like 16-20) are less sophisticated but might be more robust. The use of logarithmic or Gaussian-like functions for scoring can provide smoother preference curves.

**Experience:**
Prioritize multiple, well-defined metrics. Dynamic weighting, especially based on item characteristics, generally improves performance. Normalizing intermediate or final scores is crucial for combining disparate metrics. Avoid overly complex or unstable calculations; simpler, well-tuned heuristics often perform better.
