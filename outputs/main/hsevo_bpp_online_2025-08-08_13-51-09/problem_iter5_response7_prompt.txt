Heuristic 6 is identical.\n\nComparing Heuristics 2 and 10: Heuristic 2 scales the inverse difference by the inverse of remaining capacity, penalizing large gaps. Heuristic 10 uses a sigmoid on the fit ratio and normalizes the inverse remaining capacity, then combines them. Heuristic 2 is simpler and likely less prone to issues with parameter tuning that affect Heuristic 10's performance.\n\nComparing Heuristics 3 and 17/18 (identical): Heuristic 3 uses an inverse difference and then normalizes it with a sigmoid, aiming for a normalized priority range. Heuristics 17 and 18 are identical to Heuristic 3 but include additional parameters for sigmoid control, potentially offering more fine-tuning but increasing complexity.\n\nComparing Heuristics 4 and 5: Heuristic 4 combines Best Fit with a sigmoid penalty for large remaining capacities, using multiplication for combination. Heuristic 5 uses a composite score involving inverse remaining capacity and a fill ratio, aiming for tighter fits and better utilization. Heuristic 5's approach of combining metrics in a weighted manner seems more robust than Heuristic 4's multiplication which can lead to zero scores.\n\nComparing Heuristics 7, 8 (identical) and 11, 12, 15, 16 (identical): These heuristics combine \"Best Fit\" with an exploration bonus for less full bins using an epsilon-greedy approach. They prioritize tight fits but also explore less full bins. The difference lies in how the exploration bonus is calculated: Heuristics 7/8 use a raw difference from the average, while 11/12/15/16 use min-max scaling for normalization, potentially offering better control.\n\nComparing Heuristics 9 and 13 (identical): Identical to 7/8, using an epsilon-greedy approach with mean-based exploration bonus.\n\nComparing Heuristics 14 and 15/16: These are similar to 7/8 but use min-max scaling for the exploration bonus, which is generally more robust than using the mean.\n\nComparing Heuristics 19 and 20 (identical): These heuristics combine Best Fit with scores for original capacity and a fullness penalty, then normalize. This multi-component approach aims for a balanced solution.\n\nOverall: Heuristics that combine multiple criteria (like Best Fit with utilization or exploration) tend to be more sophisticated. Simple inverse relationships are a good baseline. Methods involving sigmoid normalization offer controlled ranges but introduce complexity. Exploration strategies (epsilon-greedy) add robustness. Heuristics 19/20 offer a well-rounded approach by combining several factors and normalizing.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Performance, Robustness, Exploration, Nuance.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on how current metrics reflect problem dynamics and adapt exploration based on observed search progress.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on static metrics or single-purpose exploration without considering their interaction.\n*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves understanding *why* a metric or exploration strategy works (or doesn't) in relation to the problem's inherent complexity, leading to more sophisticated, adaptive heuristic design.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
