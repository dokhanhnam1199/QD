Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Performance, Robustness, Exploration, Nuance.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how current metrics reflect problem dynamics and adapt exploration based on observed search progress.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on static metrics or single-purpose exploration without considering their interaction.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves understanding *why* a metric or exploration strategy works (or doesn't) in relation to the problem's inherent complexity, leading to more sophisticated, adaptive heuristic design.
