**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st and 2nd: They are identical, indicating no difference in performance.

Comparing Heuristics 3rd, 4th, and 5th: These three heuristics are identical, suggesting they represent a single approach with consistent performance. They focus on a weighted sum of "Best Fit" and "Favor Larger Bins" using min-max scaling for the latter.

Comparing Heuristics 6th with 3rd/4th/5th: Heuristic 6th uses a different approach for exploration (less utilized bins) by directly using the difference from min/max suitable bin capacities for its score, and combines it with a negative best-fit score. This suggests a variation in how "exploration" is defined and combined.

Comparing Heuristics 9th with 1st/2nd: Heuristic 9th introduces a "Modified Best Fit" using a quadratic function around a target residual, and a refined "Exploration Bonus" with a sigmoid-like function, plus a "Bin Age/Usage" proxy. This is a more complex multi-metric approach compared to the simpler linear combinations in 1st/2nd.

Comparing Heuristics 10th/11th with 1st/2nd: Heuristics 10th and 11th are identical. They combine a "tightness_scores" (inverse of remaining space) with an "emptiness_bonus" (log of remaining capacity). This is a different combination than the more complex metrics in Heuristic 1.

Comparing Heuristics 12th/13th/14th with 10th/11th: These three heuristics are identical. They are very similar to Heuristics 10th/11th, using inverse of remaining space for tightness, and a normalized remaining capacity (min-max scaled) for exploration. The key difference is the normalization method for exploration and the weighting.

Comparing Heuristics 15th with 12th/13th/14th: Heuristic 15th is identical to Heuristics 16th and 17th. It uses inverse of remaining space for Best Fit and log1p of remaining capacity for exploration, then normalizes the exploration score and combines them.

Comparing Heuristics 18th/19th with 15th/16th/17th: Heuristics 18th and 19th are identical. They are similar to 15th/16th/17th by using inverse remaining space for tightness and log of remaining capacity for exploration, but normalize the *combined* scores instead of just the exploration component.

Comparing Heuristics 20th with others: Heuristic 20th introduces "Fit Quality" (ratio of bin capacity to item size) and "Remaining Capacity Variance" reduction. This is a distinct approach that doesn't directly use "Best Fit" in the same way.

Overall: The heuristics generally explore variations of "Best Fit" (minimizing remaining space) and "Exploration" (favoring less full bins, or bins with specific properties). Normalization techniques and weighting schemes are varied. The complexity of metrics and their combination seems to loosely correlate with rank, with simpler combinations often appearing higher. Heuristics 7th and 8th are truncated and thus not fully comparable.

**Experience:**
Heuristics that combine simple, interpretable metrics like "tight fit" and "exploration" with appropriate normalization and weighting tend to perform well. Overly complex or inversely related metrics without clear justification might not improve performance. Dynamic weighting based on item size can be beneficial.
