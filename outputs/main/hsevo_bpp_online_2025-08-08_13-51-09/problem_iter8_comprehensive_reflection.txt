Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices:

*   **Keywords:** Objective balancing, nuanced scoring, robust metrics, avoiding simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how multiple objectives (primary/secondary) interact. Develop score combinations that reflect these interactions, not just additive weighting. Ensure metrics are sensitive to problem specifics.
*   **Avoid:** Sigmoid/inverse functions *solely* for scaling without justification. Blindly prioritizing "tight fit" over exploration. Over-reliance on simplistic, single-metric evaluations.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create heuristics that learn and adapt by understanding trade-offs, not by applying pre-defined, inflexible transformations. Complex interactions between objectives require thoughtful metric design and combination.
