{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize clear, well-defined metrics for \"tight fit\" and \"utilization.\" Combining multiple metrics with appropriate weighting and normalization can create more robust heuristics. Exploration strategies help avoid local optima. Simplicity is often a virtue, but consider metrics that capture nuanced aspects of bin packing.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize bins that offer a tight fit using inverse relationships or sigmoid functions for controlled scaling. Incorporate exploration mechanisms to balance greedy choices with discovering better packing configurations. Vectorized operations in NumPy are crucial for performance over explicit loops.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
