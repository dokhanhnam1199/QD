Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Metric selection, dynamic weighting, normalization, balance, robustness, simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Focus on a core set of well-defined, interpretable metrics. Systematically explore dynamic weighting and robust normalization techniques. Aim for a balance between primary objectives and secondary goals like diversification or exploration.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex or opaque mathematical transformations, unstable calculations, and prioritizing single, overly simplistic metrics.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection identifies *how* and *why* certain metric combinations and adjustments lead to improved performance by understanding their impact on the problem's core objectives.
