Prioritize bins by post-insertion remaining capacity. Add bonuses for almost-full bins and exploration noise.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, fills non-empty bins, and avoids fragmentation, yielding improved bin packing.

Prioritize perfect fits and minimize waste. Normalize waste using item size. Discourage infeasible assignments strongly.

The better code prioritizes bins with smaller waste relative to capacity, encouraging fuller bins.

Prioritize exact fits and nearly full bins; penalize infeasible bins; use a better waste minimization function.

Consider feasibility, remaining capacity, and bin emptiness. Dynamically adjust priorities using multiplication for boosting.

The better code uses normalized remaining capacity, explicit bonuses/penalties, and nuanced capacity matching for improved performance.

Focus on wasted space, avoid fragmentation, and balance bin utilization, with nuanced penalties.

Prioritize tight fits (using inverse remaining capacity), reward nearly full bins, and penalize infeasible bins strongly.

Prioritize tighter fits and consider current bin occupancy. Avoid near-full bins unless necessary.
