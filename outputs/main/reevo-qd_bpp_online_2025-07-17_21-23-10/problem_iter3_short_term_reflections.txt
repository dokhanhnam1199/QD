Prioritize feasibility, fill-rate, discourage near-empty bins, and encourage near-full bins for better packing.

The better code uses heuristics like "First-Fit Decreasing," remaining capacity, and avoiding near-full bins to improve packing.

Prioritize bins that tightly fit items. Avoid zero division and ensure bins always have a non-zero priority.

Prioritize feasibility, fullness (non-linearly), relative fit, and use a tie-breaker for exploration.

Consider bin utilization, future item placement, and handling infeasible solutions more explicitly.

Prioritize perfect fits, penalize overflow, and balance packing density with avoiding excessive fragmentation.

Prioritize feasibility, fill-rate, and avoiding near-empty bins. Reward near-full bins for better packing.

Prioritize fullness, penalize infeasibility, and add a bonus for almost-full bins to improve bin utilization.

Prioritize bins with `remaining_space <= item`, reward exact fits, and penalize significant wastage.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize waste, and boost almost-full bins. Consider bin usage history for further improvement.
