The better code prioritizes feasibility, fill-rate, and avoidance of near-empty/full bins, with a waste-minimization bonus.

Feasibility, tightness, fullness, waste reduction, and balanced bin usage are key for improved heuristics.

Refine thresholds, add nuanced penalties/bonuses (quadratic waste, near-empty discouragement), and dynamic scaling improve performance.

Feasibility, fullness, waste management, and balanced bin usage improve online bin packing heuristics.

The better code uses multiple heuristics: feasibility, tightness, fullness, balanced usage, and waste reduction to improve packing.

The better code uses feasibility checks, rewards tightness/fullness, penalizes waste, and balances bin usage.

Prioritize feasibility, reward tightness, encourage fullness, and penalize waste for better bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fits, fullness; penalize waste. Dynamically scale rewards/penalties based on bin capacity.

Refine thresholds dynamically, scale bonuses/penalties, and consider previous bin states for balanced usage.

The better code uses feasibility, tightness, fullness, waste avoidance, and balanced bin usage for improved performance.
