Feasibility, fill-rate, avoiding near-empty bins, and encouraging near-full bins are crucial. Minimize wasted space.

Prioritize feasibility, fullness, balanced bin usage, and penalize waste. Dynamically scale thresholds based on remaining capacities.

Tighter fit rewards, scaled penalties, and balanced bin usage improve online bin packing heuristics.

Scale penalties/bonuses dynamically. Reward balanced bin usage by considering initial capacity.

The better code uses relative metrics, scaled bonuses/penalties, and discourages extreme bin states, improving balance.

The better code uses feasibility, fullness, waste avoidance, and balanced bin usage for improved performance.

The improved code uses feasibility checks, fill-rate prioritization, and waste minimization with adjusted thresholds and bonuses.

Fine-tune weights, thresholds, and penalty functions. Add more nuanced rules discouraging fragmentation/imbalance.

Refine thresholds, scale penalties/bonuses dynamically, and discourage near-empty bins for improvement.

Better code uses reciprocal remaining space, scaled fullness boost, waste penalty, and balanced bin usage bonus.
