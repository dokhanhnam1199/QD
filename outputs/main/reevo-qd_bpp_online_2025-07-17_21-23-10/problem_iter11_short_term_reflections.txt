Tuning weights, non-linear penalties, and fragmentation avoidance improve bin packing heuristics.

Tighter thresholds, scaled penalties/bonuses, and balancing bin utilization improve packing performance.

Consider feasibility, waste, fullness, balanced usage, and avoid fragmentation for better heuristics.

Prioritize tight fits using inverse remaining space. Add fullness bonus, waste penalty, and balance bin usage.

Scale penalties/rewards. Encourage balanced bin use with initial capacity bonus.

Enhanced fit reward, scaled waste penalty, balanced bin usage, and discouraged near-empty bins are key improvements.

Tuning thresholds, non-linear penalties, and discouraging near-empty bins improve packing.

Prioritize tight fits, dynamically scale thresholds, and penalize waste more aggressively.

Scale penalties/bonuses dynamically based on remaining/initial capacity. Encourage balanced bin usage with bonuses.

Tuning thresholds, scaling bonuses/penalties, and encouraging balanced bin usage improved performance.
