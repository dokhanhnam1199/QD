Prioritize feasibility, fill-rate, and avoidance of near-empty bins. Reward near-full bins and minimize waste.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fits, fullness. Penalize waste. Dynamically scale rewards/penalties based on capacity.

Prioritize fitting items, minimizing wasted space, and filling bins completely to avoid fragmentation.

Feasibility, tight fits, fullness, and waste management are crucial for bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, and reward near-full bins to reduce fragmentation.

Consider feasibility, remaining space, and fragmentation reduction for improved bin packing heuristics.

Consider feasibility, tight fits, fullness, and penalize waste. Explore dynamic scaling and avoid extreme values.

Prioritize feasibility, tight fits, fullness, and penalize waste to guide item placement effectively.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, fill-rate, and avoids near-empty bins, also encouraging nearly full bins and minimizing waste.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, and significantly penalize infeasible placements. Exploit domain knowledge (e.g., "almost full").
