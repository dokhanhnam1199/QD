[Prior reflection]
Prioritize tight fits using sigmoid or softmax for smooth preference. Minimize `remaining_capacity - item`. Break ties with lower bin indices. Focus on simple, inversely proportional relationships for tightness.

    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For bins that can fit the item, assign a priority based on their remaining capacity.
    # The strategy is to prioritize bins that are *almost full*.
    # This means we want to select bins with the smallest positive remaining capacity
    # after placing the item.
    # A higher priority should be given to bins with *less* remaining capacity
    # after the item is placed, but only if they can still accommodate it.
    #
    # The remaining capacity after placing the item is `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # To give higher priority to smaller remaining capacities, we can use the
    # negative of the remaining capacity.
    #
    # Example:
    # If bin_remain_cap = [5, 3, 7] and item = 2:
    #   - Bin 0: can_fit = True, remaining_after_item = 3. Priority: -3
    #   - Bin 1: can_fit = True, remaining_after_item = 1. Priority: -1 (HIGHER PRIORITY)
    #   - Bin 2: can_fit = True, remaining_after_item = 5. Priority: -5
    #
    # So, the priority is `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.

    priorities[can_fit_mask] = -(bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item)

    # To further refine AFF, we might want to break ties.
    # A common tie-breaking mechanism for bin packing is to prefer bins that have
    # been used for longer, or simply the first encountered bin.
    # In this implementation, numpy's default behavior will handle ties by
    # returning the indices in the order they appear, which implicitly favors
    # earlier bins in case of identical priority scores.

    # We want to prioritize bins with *smaller* remaining_after_item.
    # A sigmoid function can map these values to a (0, 1) range, where smaller
    # remaining_after_item values map to values closer to 1.
    #
    # To use sigmoid effectively:
    # - We want the input to sigmoid to be a decreasing function of remaining_after_item.
    # - So, we use `-remaining_after_item`.
    # - To control the steepness and center of the sigmoid, we can scale and shift.
    #   Let's assume we want tighter fits to have higher priority.
    #   A large negative value of `-remaining_after_item` (i.e., large positive `remaining_after_item`)
    #   should result in a low sigmoid output.
    #   A small negative value of `-remaining_after_item` (i.e., small positive `remaining_after_item`)
    #   should result in a high sigmoid output.
    #
    # A common form of sigmoid is 1 / (1 + exp(-x)).
    # If we input `-remaining_after_item`, then as `remaining_after_item` decreases,
    # `-remaining_after_item` increases, and the sigmoid output increases.
    #
    # To ensure we prioritize *very* tight fits (small positive `remaining_after_item`),
    # we can transform `remaining_after_item` to emphasize smaller positive values.
    #
    # Let's consider a transformation that is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity.
    # However, direct inverse might cause division by zero if remaining capacity is zero.
    #
    # A simpler approach for "tight fit" without complex scaling for sigmoid
    # is to directly use the negative of the remaining capacity as in v1,
    # but we can slightly modify it to emphasize smaller positive differences.
    #
    # For a smooth preference, we can use a form like:
    # priority = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (remaining_after_item - offset)))
    # where k controls steepness and offset is a reference point.
    #
    # To prioritize small positive `remaining_after_item`:
    # We want `priority` to be high when `remaining_after_item` is small and positive.
    # If `remaining_after_item` is small positive, `k * (remaining_after_item - offset)`
    # should be a large negative number (if `offset` is positive and `remaining_after_item` < `offset`).
    #
    # Let's use a simpler, yet effective, approach that emphasizes tighter fits without explicit sigmoid:
    # Prioritize bins where `remaining_after_item` is small.
    # We can achieve this by using a transformation that is inversely related to `remaining_after_item`.
    # For instance, `1 / (1 + remaining_after_item)` would give higher values for smaller `remaining_after_item`.
    # To make it more like a priority score (higher is better), we can use `1 / (1 + remaining_after_item)`.
    #
    # For tie-breaking with lower bin indices, we can add a small value proportional to the inverse of the index.
    # However, numpy's `argmax` on the priority array will naturally select the first encountered maximum if priorities are equal.
    # To explicitly favor lower indices, we can add a small penalty for higher indices.
    # A common way to do this is to add `epsilon * (N - index)` to the priority, where N is total bins.
    # A simpler way is to add a small value that is decreasing with index, like `1/index`.

    # Let's use the inverse of (1 + remaining_after_item) as the core priority.
    # Adding a small bonus for lower indices to break ties.
    # We need to ensure that these added values don't overshadow the primary priority.
    # A simple approach for tie-breaking is to scale the index negatively.
    # For example, priority_score = base_priority - (index * small_epsilon).
    # Or, priority_score = base_priority + (1.0 / (index + 1)) * small_epsilon.
    # Let's aim for a simple heuristic: prioritize tightest fits, and among those,
    # favor bins that were opened earlier (lower index).

    # A simple priority: `1 / (1 + remaining_after_item)` gives higher scores to smaller gaps.
    # To include tie-breaking for lower indices, we can modify the score.
    # If we want lower indices to have higher priority in case of ties, we can subtract
    # a small value that increases with index.
    # Let's subtract `index * epsilon` where epsilon is a very small number.
    # Example: index 0 gets `0`, index 1 gets `-epsilon`, index 2 gets `-2*epsilon`.
    # This way, if two bins have the same `1 / (1 + remaining_after_item)` value,
    # the one with the lower index will have a higher final priority.

    # Small epsilon to ensure index-based tie-breaking doesn't dominate.
    epsilon_tie_break = 1e-9

    # Calculate priorities for bins that can fit the item.
    # The core idea is to prioritize smaller `remaining_after_item`.
    # The function `1 / (1 + x)` is decreasing for x >= 0.
    # So, smaller `remaining_after_item` will result in a higher score.
    # We use `1 + remaining_after_item` to avoid division by zero if `remaining_after_item` is 0.
    core_priorities = 1.0 / (1.0 + remaining_after_item)

    # Apply tie-breaking by subtracting a small value proportional to the index.
    # We need the original indices to subtract the correct amount.
    # `np.where(can_fit_mask)[0]` gives the indices of bins that can fit.
    fitting_indices = np.where(can_fit_mask)[0]

    # Create a refined priority array for only the fitting bins
