Prioritize tight fits. Use softmax for soft prioritization of good fits.
Prioritize bins minimizing `remaining_capacity - item`. Focus on "tightest fit".
Prioritize smaller remaining capacities after packing for better bin utilization.
Prioritize minimal slack. Use sigmoid for graceful preference.
Prioritize minimal slack. Sigmoid functions elegantly penalize excess capacity for better fits.
Prioritize tightness, use simple scoring, and break ties with bin index.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after placement.
Focus on simple, inversely proportional relationships for tightness; avoid complex multi-stage logic.
Prioritize tight fits, then use softmax for smoother probability distributions.
Prioritize based on smoothed differences or ratios; avoid hard thresholds.
