[Reflection]
The current `priority_v1` function implements an "Almost Full Fit" strategy by prioritizing bins with the smallest remaining capacity *after* the item is placed. This is achieved by assigning a priority of `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`. This means smaller `bins_remain_cap - item` values result in larger (less negative) priority scores, which is correct for a maximization problem.

The reflection suggests:
1.  **Prioritize tight fits using sigmoid or softmax for smooth preference.** The current approach uses a linear relationship. Sigmoid or softmax can introduce non-linearity and make the preference for tighter fits "smoother". Sigmoid maps values to (0, 1), and softmax maps to a probability distribution. For a priority score, sigmoid might be more appropriate as it produces a continuous score. A common way to use sigmoid for this is `sigmoid(C - (remaining_capacity - item))` where `C` is a constant to tune the steepness of the preference. A large `C - (remaining_capacity - item)` (meaning small `remaining_capacity - item`) will result in a high sigmoid value.
2.  **Minimize `remaining_capacity - item`.** This is already implicitly done by making `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` the priority. Smaller `remaining_capacity - item` leads to a higher priority.
3.  **Break ties with lower bin indices.** NumPy's `argmax` (which would be used to find the highest priority bin) naturally returns the first index in case of ties. So, this is already handled.

Let's focus on incorporating the sigmoid for smoother preference. We can define the priority as `sigmoid(K - (remaining_capacity - item))`, where `K` is a scaling factor. A larger `K` would make the preference for a tighter fit stronger. For simplicity and to ensure that bins that *cannot* fit the item get a low priority, we can apply the sigmoid only to those that can fit.

Consider the function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.
If we want to prioritize smaller `remaining_capacity - item`, we can use `sigmoid(K * (item - remaining_capacity))` or `sigmoid(K * (MaxCapacity - bins_remain_cap - item))`.
Let `diff = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want smaller `diff` to have higher priority.
So, `sigmoid(K * (some_value - diff))`. A simple choice for `some_value` could be 0 or a small positive constant.
Let's try `sigmoid(K * (item - bins_remain_cap))`. If `bins_remain_cap = 5`, `item = 2`, then `item - bins_remain_cap = -3`. `sigmoid(K * -3)` is close to 0. If `bins_remain_cap = 3`, `item = 2`, then `item - bins_remain_cap = -1`. `sigmoid(K * -1)` is larger. This seems counter-intuitive.

Let's rethink the argument to sigmoid. We want a larger output for smaller `remaining_capacity - item`.
So, we want an argument that *decreases* as `remaining_capacity - item` increases.
The term `bins_remain_cap - item` itself increases as we move away from a tight fit.
So, let's use `sigmoid(K * -(bins_remain_cap - item))` or `sigmoid(K * (item - bins_remain_cap))`.
If `bins_remain_cap = 5`, `item = 2`, `diff = 3`. `item - bins_remain_cap = -3`. `sigmoid(K * -3)` is low.
If `bins_remain_cap = 3`, `item = 2`, `diff = 1`. `item - bins_remain_cap = -1`. `sigmoid(K * -1)` is higher.
This is still giving higher priority to *less tight* fits.

Okay, let's try again. We want to maximize priority. Priority should be high for small `bins_remain_cap - item`.
Let `tightness_score = -(bins_remain_cap - item)`. This score is higher for tighter fits.
We can apply sigmoid to this score: `sigmoid(K * tightness_score) = sigmoid(K * -(bins_remain_cap - item))`.
Let `K=1`.
`bins_remain_cap = [5, 3, 7]`, `item = 2`.
Bin 0: `rem=5`, `tightness = -(5-2) = -3`. `sigmoid(-3)` ≈ 0.047
Bin 1: `rem=3`, `tightness = -(3-2) = -1`. `sigmoid(-1)` ≈ 0.269
Bin 2: `rem=7`, `tightness = -(7-2) = -5`. `sigmoid(-5)` ≈ 0.0067
This seems to work. The highest priority is for the bin with `remaining_capacity = 3`.

To ensure that bins that *cannot* fit are completely ignored, we can set their priority to 0 (or a very small negative number if sigmoid output is always positive). Since sigmoid output is in `(0, 1)`, setting priorities to 0 for non-fitting bins is appropriate.

Let's choose a value for `K`. A larger `K` will make the preference steeper. Let's start with `K=1` or `K=2` for demonstration.
We can also add a small constant to shift the sigmoid's output range if needed, but for relative priorities, `sigmoid(K * tightness_score)` should be fine.

Consider the original AFF priority: `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
For `bins_remain_cap = [5, 3, 7]`, `item = 2`: priorities are `[-3, -1, -5]`. Max is `-1`.
Using sigmoid: `[0.047, 0.269, 0.0067]`. Max is `0.269`.
The relative order is preserved, but the preference is smoothed.

The reflection also mentions "Minimize `remaining_capacity - item`". This is what `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` does.
"Break ties with lower bin indices." This is handled by `argmax`.

Let's implement the sigmoid approach. We need `numpy` and `scipy.special.expit` (which is sigmoid).

A potential issue: if `bins_remain_cap` is very large and `item` is small, `bins_remain_cap - item` can be large positive, leading to `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` being large negative. `sigmoid` of a large negative number is close to 0. This is good, as these bins are not tight fits.
If `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`, `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive, `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` is small negative. `sigmoid` of small negative is near 0.5.
If `bins_remain_cap == item`, `bins_remain_cap - item = 0`, `-(bins_remain_cap - item) = 0`. `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
If `bins_remain_cap < item`, these are filtered out.

So, a bin that exactly fits (`bins_remain_cap == item`) gets a priority of 0.5. A bin that is slightly larger (`bins_remain_cap = item + epsilon`) gets a priority less than 0.5. A bin that is much larger gets priority close to 0.
This might be counter-intuitive. We want bins that are *almost full* to have the highest priority.

Let's re-evaluate the sigmoid argument. We want higher priority for *smaller* `bins_remain_cap - item`.
Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want `f(x)` to be high for small `x >= 0`.
The sigmoid function `sigmoid(a*x + b)` increases with `x`.
We need a function that *decreases* with `x`.
So, let's use `sigmoid(-a*x + b)`.
`sigmoid(-a * (bins_remain_cap - item) + b)`
Let `a` be a positive constant, controlling steepness. Let `b` be a constant to shift the curve.
If `bins_remain_cap = 3`, `item = 2`, then `x = 1`. Priority: `sigmoid(-a + b)`.
If `bins_remain_cap = 5`, `item = 2`, then `x = 3`. Priority: `sigmoid(-3a + b)`.
We want `sigmoid(-a + b) > sigmoid(-3a + b)`, which is true if `-a + b > -3a + b`, which simplifies to `2a > 0`, which is true since `a > 0`.

So, `sigmoid(-a * (bins_remain_cap - item) + b)` is the correct form.
What should `a` and `b` be?
Let `a` be a scaling factor for the difference. A larger `a` means the preference for tightness is stronger. Let's pick `a=1` for now.
What about `b`? `b` shifts the activation threshold. If we want the "sweet spot" to be around a remaining capacity of 0 (i.e., `bins_remain_cap - item = 0`), then setting `b=0` would make `sigmoid(0) = 0.5` for perfect fits.
If `bins_remain_cap - item = 1`, priority is `sigmoid(-1)`.
If `bins_remain_cap - item = 0`, priority is `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
If `bins_remain_cap - item = -1` (item too large), this case is filtered.

This means bins that are *exactly* full get priority 0.5, slightly fuller bins get higher priority (e.g., `bins_remain_cap = item - 1` would yield `sigmoid(1) approx 0.73`), and bins that leave more space get lower priority. This seems correct.

Let's choose `a=2` to make the preference steeper for tighter fits.
So, `priority = sigmoid(2 * (item - bins_remain_cap))`.
For `bins_remain_cap = [5, 3, 7]`, `item = 2`:
Bin 0: `rem=5`, `arg = 2*(2-5) = -6`. `sigmoid(-6)` ≈ 0.0025
Bin 1: `rem=3`, `arg = 2*(2-3) = -2`. `sigmoid(-2)` ≈ 0.119
Bin 2: `rem=7`, `arg = 2*(2-7) = -10`. `sigmoid(-10)` ≈ 0.000045

This seems to prioritize the *least* tight fit among the valid ones. This is the opposite of what we want.

Let's try argument `K * (remaining_capacity - item)`. We want this to be *negative* for tight fits, and the more negative, the better.
`sigmoid(K * (remaining_capacity - item))`
Let `K=1`.
Bin 0: `rem=5`, `item=2`, `arg = 1*(5-2) = 3`. `sigmoid(3)` ≈ 0.95
Bin 1: `rem=3`, `item=2`, `arg = 1*(3-2) = 1`. `sigmoid(1)` ≈ 0.73
Bin 2: `rem=7`, `item=2`, `arg = 1*(7-2) = 5`. `sigmoid(5)` ≈ 0.993

This prioritizes the *loosest* fit.

Okay, let's go back to basics. We want to maximize `priority`.
Priority should be high when `remaining_capacity - item` is small (and non-negative).
Let `diff = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want to maximize `f(diff)` where `f` is high for small `diff >= 0`.
The function `-diff` is high for small `diff`. So, `priority = -diff` is a good linear starting point.

To use sigmoid smoothly:
We want `sigmoid(g(diff))` where `g(diff)` is decreasing.
So `g(diff) = -diff` or `g(diff) = C - diff`.
Let's use `sigmoid(C - diff) = sigmoid(C - (bins_remain_cap - item))`.
Let `C=0`. Priority is `sigmoid(-(bins_remain_cap - item))`.
Bin 0: `rem=5`, `item=2`, `arg = -(5-2) = -3`. `sigmoid(-3)` ≈ 0.047
Bin 1: `rem=3`, `item=2`, `arg = -(3-2) = -1`. `sigmoid(-1)` ≈ 0.269
Bin 2: `rem=7`, `item=2`, `arg = -(7-2) = -5`. `sigmoid(-5)` ≈ 0.0067
This prioritizes bin 1 (tightest fit) correctly.

Now, let's consider the scaling factor `K` for steepness.
We want to prioritize tighter fits more strongly. This means the function should drop off faster as `bins_remain_cap - item` increases.
So, we want `sigmoid(-K * (bins_remain_cap - item))` where `K > 0`.
Let `K=2`.
Bin 0: `rem=5`, `item=2`, `arg = -2*(5-2) = -6`. `sigmoid(-6)` ≈ 0.0025
Bin 1: `rem=3`, `item=2`, `arg = -2*(3-2) = -2`. `sigmoid(-2)` ≈ 0.119
Bin 2: `rem=7`, `item=2`, `arg = -2*(7-2) = -10`. `sigmoid(-10)` ≈ 0.000045

This seems to provide a smoother preference, and the relative ordering is maintained, with the tightest fit still having the highest score. The reflection asks to prioritize tight fits *using sigmoid*. This seems to be the correct interpretation.

We should also handle the case where `bins_remain_cap < item`. For these, the priority should be effectively negative infinity (or zero if using sigmoid).
The `can_fit_mask` handles this. For bins that cannot fit, their priority should remain `-np.inf` or be set to a value that ensures they are never chosen. Since sigmoid outputs are in `(0, 1)`, setting non-fitting bins to `0` is appropriate.

Let's use `scipy.special.expit` for sigmoid.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a sigmoid-based

    """
    # Initialize priorities to 0. This ensures bins that cannot fit the item
    # will have the lowest possible priority (since sigmoid outputs are > 0).
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins that can fit the item
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For bins that can fit the item, calculate priority using a sigmoid function.

    # for tighter fits. A higher K makes the preference for tighter fits steeper.
    #
    # Let diff = bins_remain_cap - item. We want higher priority for smaller diff >= 0.

    # Let's use K=2 for a reasonably steep preference.
    K = 2.0
    
    # Calculate the argument for the sigmoid function: K * (item - remaining_capacity)
    # This term will be negative for bins that can fit the item.
    # Tighter fits (smaller remaining_capacity) will result in a less negative argument,
    # leading to a higher sigmoid output.
    argument = K * (item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])

    # expit(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = expit(argument)

    # Tie-breaking: If multiple bins have the exact same highest priority,
    # np.argmax will select the one with the lowest index. This fulfills the
    # tie-breaking requirement.

    return priorities
```

Let's test with some values:
`item = 5`
`bins_remain_cap = [10, 7, 5, 3, 12]`

`can_fit_mask = [True, True, True, False, True]`
Relevant `bins_remain_cap`: `[10, 7, 5, 12]`
Item: `5`

Bin 0: rem=10. diff = 10-5=5. arg = 2*(5-10) = -10. sigmoid(-10) ~ 4.5e-5
Bin 1: rem=7. diff = 7-5=2. arg = 2*(5-7) = -4. sigmoid(-4) ~ 0.018
Bin 2: rem=5. diff = 5-5=0. arg = 2*(5-5) = 0. sigmoid(0) = 0.5
Bin 3: rem=3. Cannot fit. Priority = 0.
Bin 4: rem=12. diff = 12-5=7. arg = 2*(5-12) = -14. sigmoid(-14) ~ 0.8e-6

Priorities: `[4.5e-5, 0.018, 0.5, 0, 0.8e-6]`
The highest priority is for bin 2 (exact fit), followed by bin 1 (slightly larger remaining capacity). This is the desired behavior.

What if we use `K=5` for a steeper preference?
Bin 0: rem=10. diff = 5. arg = 5*(5-10) = -25. sigmoid(-25) ~ 1.3e-11
Bin 1: rem=7. diff = 2. arg = 5*(5-7) = -10. sigmoid(-10) ~ 4.5e-5
Bin 2: rem=5. diff = 0. arg = 5*(5-5) = 0. sigmoid(0) = 0.5
Bin 4: rem=12. diff = 7. arg = 5*(5-12) = -35. sigmoid(-35) ~ 2.9e-16

Priorities: `[1.3e-11, 4.5e-5, 0.5, 0, 2.9e-16]`
With `K=5`, the preference for the exact fit (0.5) is much stronger compared to the next best fit (0.000045). This demonstrates the effect of `K`.

The prompt asks for a mutated function `priority_v2`. The core difference is the use of sigmoid.

Final check on requirements:
- Priority function for online Bin Packing BPP. Yes.
- Input: item, bins_remain_cap. Yes.
- Returns priority score for each bin. Yes.
- Bin with highest priority score selected. Yes (implicit use of argmax).
- Prioritize tight fits using sigmoid for smooth preference. Yes, `sigmoid(K * (item - bins_remain_cap))` achieves this.
- Minimize `remaining_capacity - item`. Yes, this is achieved by making the sigmoid argument increasingly negative as `remaining_capacity - item` increases.
- Break ties with lower bin indices. Yes, handled by `np.argmax`.

The function appears solid.
