[Prior reflection]
The previous `priority_v1` function implements the "Almost Full Fit" (AFF) strategy by prioritizing bins with the smallest remaining capacity after an item is placed. This is a good heuristic for minimizing wasted space. However, the reflection suggests improvements:

1.  **Smooth Preference with Sigmoid:** Instead of a linear relationship, use a sigmoid function to provide a smoother preference for bins that are "almost full." This can prevent drastic jumps in priority and might lead to more stable packing decisions.
2.  **Ensure Items Always Fit:** The current logic already ensures items fit by using `can_fit_mask`. The sigmoid function should also be designed such that it only applies to bins where the item *can* fit.
3.  **Tie-breaking with Lower Bin Indices:** While `v1` has implicit tie-breaking due to NumPy's behavior, explicitly adding a penalty for higher indices could make this tie-breaking mechanism more robust and predictable.

Let's break down the implementation of `priority_v2`:

*   **Sigmoid Function:** A sigmoid function like `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` squashes values between 0 and 1. We want higher priority for smaller remaining capacities. So, we can apply sigmoid to a transformation of the remaining capacity.
    *   The core idea of AFF is to prioritize bins where `remaining_capacity - item` is small. Let `r = remaining_capacity - item`. We want higher priority for smaller `r`.
    *   A simple sigmoid applied to `-r` would work: `sigmoid(-r) = 1 / (1 + exp(r))`. As `r` gets smaller (closer to 0), `exp(r)` gets closer to 1, and the sigmoid approaches `1/2`. As `r` gets larger, `exp(r)` gets larger, and the sigmoid approaches 0. This is not quite right; we want *higher* priority for *smaller* `r`.
    *   Let's re-evaluate: we want to maximize priority for bins where `remaining_capacity - item` is minimal and positive.
    *   Consider `f(r) = K - r` for some large `K`. We want to maximize this. This is essentially what `v1` does.
    *   To make it smooth, we can use a sigmoid on a transformed `r`. If `r` is small positive, we want high priority. If `r` is large positive, we want low priority.
    *   Let's map `r` to a value where a sigmoid function makes sense. We want small `r` to map to a high value in the sigmoid's steep region, and large `r` to map to a lower value.
    *   A function like `sigmoid(C - r)` where `C` is a scaling constant might work. If `r` is small, `C - r` is large, sigmoid is close to 1. If `r` is large, `C - r` is small, sigmoid is closer to 0. This seems appropriate.
    *   We need to choose `C` and potentially scale the output. The `bins_remain_cap` can vary. A fixed `C` might not generalize well.
    *   Alternatively, consider prioritizing based on `1 / (1 + (remaining_capacity - item))`. Small positive `remaining_capacity - item` gives a high score. Large positive gives a low score. This is still linear-ish.
    *   Let's stick to the idea of prioritizing bins with small *positive* remaining capacity *after* placing the item.
    *   Let `residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`. We want to prioritize smaller `residual_capacity`.
    *   A possible transformation for sigmoid: `priority_score = sigmoid(k * (some_value - residual_capacity))`. If `some_value` is large, smaller `residual_capacity` leads to larger argument, higher sigmoid.
    *   What if we use the *proportion* of capacity used? If a bin is `c` capacity and item is `i`, after placing it, remaining is `c-i`. The proportion used is `i/c`. Prioritizing bins that are "almost full" means prioritizing those where `i/c` is large, or `c-i` is small.
    *   Let's focus on `residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`.
    *   We want a score that is high for small `residual_capacity` and low for large `residual_capacity`.
    *   The sigmoid function `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` is increasing. If we want higher priority for smaller `residual_capacity`, we need to feed it a value that *decreases* as `residual_capacity` increases.
    *   So, let's consider `priority_component = sigmoid(-k * residual_capacity)` for some scaling factor `k`.
        *   If `residual_capacity` is small (e.g., 0.1), `-k * 0.1` is negative but close to zero. Sigmoid is around 0.5.
        *   If `residual_capacity` is very small positive (e.g., epsilon), `-k * epsilon` is close to zero, sigmoid is near 0.5.
        *   If `residual_capacity` is slightly larger (e.g., 1), `-k * 1` is more negative, sigmoid is smaller.
        *   This is still not quite right. We want small positive `residual_capacity` to yield the *highest* priority.
    *   Let's reconsider the goal: prioritize bins that are *almost full*. This means the remaining capacity `bins_remain_cap` is just slightly larger than `item`.
    *   So, we are interested in `bins_remain_cap - item` being small and positive.
    *   Let's use `sigmoid(a - b * residual_capacity)` where `a` is an offset and `b` is a steepness factor.
    *   If `residual_capacity` is small, `a - b * residual_capacity` is large, sigmoid is close to 1 (high priority).
    *   If `residual_capacity` is large, `a - b * residual_capacity` is small, sigmoid is close to 0 (low priority).
    *   We need to choose `a` and `b`. A simple approach might be to normalize `residual_capacity`.
    *   However, a direct mapping using a sigmoid centered around zero remaining capacity might be simpler. `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]))`.
        *   If `bins_remain_cap` is just slightly larger than `item`, then `item - bins_remain_cap` is small and negative. `-k * small_negative` is small positive. Sigmoid is > 0.5.
        *   If `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`, then `item - bins_remain_cap` is large and negative. `-k * large_negative` is large positive. Sigmoid is close to 1. This is the opposite of what we want!
    *   Let's try `sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item))`.
        *   If `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`, then `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive. `k * small_positive` is small positive. Sigmoid is > 0.5.
        *   If `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`, then `bins_remain_cap - item` is large positive. `k * large_positive` is large positive. Sigmoid is close to 1. This is still prioritizing *less full* bins.
    *   The core idea of AFF is to prioritize bins that leave the *least* space. So, we want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.
    *   Let's apply sigmoid to this value, possibly scaled. `sigmoid(k * -(bins_remain_cap - item))`.
        *   If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small positive (e.g., 0.1), then `-0.1k`. If `k` is positive, this is negative. Sigmoid is < 0.5.
        *   If `bins_remain_cap - item` is larger positive (e.g., 5), then `-5k`. Sigmoid is much smaller.
        *   This is also not quite right. We want high priority for small positive `remaining_capacity - item`.
    *   Perhaps the sigmoid should be applied to a value that is *inversely* related to `remaining_capacity - item`.
    *   Consider `1 / (1 + (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item))`. As `residual_capacity` approaches 0, this goes to 1. As it goes to infinity, it goes to 0. This looks promising, but it's not sigmoid.
    *   Let's use `sigmoid` on a transformed version of `residual_capacity`. We want small `residual_capacity` to map to values near 1.
    *   Let `x = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`. We want high priority for small `x`.
    *   Consider `priority = sigmoid(k * (M - x))` where `M` is a threshold. If `x < M`, `M-x` is positive, sigmoid is > 0.5. If `x > M`, `M-x` is negative, sigmoid is < 0.5. This gives preference to bins below a threshold.
    *   To make it smoothly prefer smaller `x`, we want the sigmoid's steep part around small `x`.
    *   Let's try `sigmoid(k * (TargetCapacity - residual_capacity))`. If `TargetCapacity` is the bin capacity, and `residual_capacity` is `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`, this means we're prioritizing bins that are closest to having `TargetCapacity - item` remaining.
    *   Let's use the concept of "slack": `slack = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`. We want to minimize slack.
    *   A sigmoid function that increases as slack decreases: `sigmoid(k * (-slack))`.
        *   If `slack` is small positive (0.1), `-0.1k`. If `k` is large positive, this is negative. Sigmoid < 0.5.
        *   If `slack` is close to zero (epsilon), `-epsilon*k` is near zero. Sigmoid is near 0.5.
        *   If `slack` is negative (item doesn't fit), this is positive. Sigmoid is > 0.5. But we've filtered these out.
    *   The reflection mentions "smallest *positive* remaining capacity." This means `bins_remain_cap[i] - item > 0`.
    *   Let's define `slack = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`. We want to maximize a function that decreases with `slack`.
    *   Consider `sigmoid(k * (1.0 / (slack + epsilon)))` for small `epsilon`.
        *   If `slack` is small positive (0.1), `1/(0.1+eps)` is large. Sigmoid is near 1.
        *   If `slack` is large positive (5), `1/(5+eps)` is small. Sigmoid is near 0.5.
    *   This seems to capture the "smallest positive remaining capacity" preference smoothly. Let's choose `k=1` and `epsilon = 1e-9` for numerical stability.

*   **Tie-breaking:** Add a small penalty based on the bin index. We want to prefer lower indices. So, we should subtract a value proportional to the index.
    *   `priority = sigmoid_score - index_penalty * bin_index`.
    *   The sigmoid scores are between 0 and 1. The penalty should be small enough not to override the sigmoid preference but significant enough for tie-breaking. A small fraction of the sigmoid range, like `0.1 * index / num_bins`, could work. Or simply subtract `index * small_constant`.
    *   Let's use `priorities[can_fit_mask] = sigmoid_score - tie_breaker_weight * np.arange(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])[can_fit_mask]`. The `tie_breaker_weight` should be small. A value like `0.01` might be sufficient.

Let's try combining these.
The sigmoid should be applied to `k * (1.0 / (slack + epsilon))`.
`slack = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`.
We need a scaling factor `k` for the sigmoid argument. The range of `1.0 / (slack + epsilon)` can be large. A sigmoid `1/(1+exp(-x))` has its steepest part around `x=0`. We want the steep part to cover the typical range of `1.0 / (slack + epsilon)`. If `slack` is typically between 0 and, say, 5, then `1/(slack+eps)` is between 0.2 and 10.
Let's scale the sigmoid argument by a factor `k` such that the typical values of `1/(slack+eps)` are in the "middle" range of the sigmoid.
If we use `sigmoid(k * arg)`, and we want the steep region around `arg = 0`, then `arg` should be `1.0 / (slack + epsilon)`.
If we want the steep part around `slack` values that are "small", say `slack` around `0.5`, then `1/(0.5+eps)` is around `2`. So we want the sigmoid to be centered around `arg = 2`.
Let's rethink the sigmoid transformation.
The goal is to prioritize bins with `slack = bins_remain_cap - item` being small and positive.
The function `f(slack) = 1 / (slack + epsilon)` is decreasing.
We want a smooth function that maps small positive slack to high priority, and large positive slack to low priority.
The sigmoid `S(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` is increasing.
So we need to map slack to an argument `y` such that `S(y)` increases as slack decreases. This means `y` must decrease as slack decreases.
Thus, `y` should be something like `k * (C - slack)`.
Let's try `y = k * (1.0 / (slack + epsilon))`. This is decreasing in slack.
If `slack` is small (e.g., 0.1), `y` is large positive. `sigmoid(y)` is near 1.
If `slack` is larger (e.g., 5), `y` is smaller positive. `sigmoid(y)` is less than 1, approaching 0.5.
This appears to work. Let's choose `k`. The range of `1.0 / (slack + epsilon)` for typical `slack` values (e.g., 0 to 10) is roughly 0.1 to 10.
If `k=0.5`, then `y` ranges from 0.05 to 5. `sigmoid(0.05)` is ~0.51, `sigmoid(5)` is ~0.99. This prioritizes smaller slack too much.
If `k=0.1`, `y` ranges from 0.01 to 1. `sigmoid(0.01)` is ~0.505, `sigmoid(1)` is ~0.73. This is too flat.
The "steepest" part of sigmoid is around argument 0. We want small slack values to map to arguments around 0, or slightly positive.
If we want the steep part to be around `slack=0.5`, we'd want `1/(0.5+eps)` to map to argument 0. This is tricky.

Let's simplify the sigmoid application.
The problem statement implies we want bins that are "almost full". This means `bins_remain_cap` is small, but still greater than or equal to `item`.
So, we are prioritizing small values of `bins_remain_cap` *among those that can fit the item*.
Consider `bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]`. We want to prioritize the smallest values in this subset.
A sigmoid applied to `(-bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])` would give higher values for smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
`sigmoid(-bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])`:
If `bins_remain_cap` is 3, `-3`. Sigmoid is small.
If `bins_remain_cap` is 1, `-1`. Sigmoid is larger.
This prioritizes bins with less *absolute* remaining capacity, which is good.

Let's try applying sigmoid to `k * (TargetValue - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])`.
If `TargetValue` is the bin capacity, and we want bins where `bins_remain_cap` is small.
A better approach for AFF is to prioritize bins that, after packing the item, will have the smallest *remaining capacity*.
This is `bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`. We want to minimize this.
Let `residual = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`. We want to prioritize smaller `residual`.
Consider `sigmoid(k * (M - residual))`.
If `M` is some target value (e.g., average residual capacity, or just a constant).
If `residual` is small (e.g., 0.1), `M - 0.1` is large positive (if M is positive). Sigmoid is near 1.
If `residual` is large (e.g., 5), `M - 5` is small positive or negative. Sigmoid is < 0.5 or near 0.5.

Let's use a sigmoid on the *negative* of the residual capacity, scaled.
`sigmoid(k * -(bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item))`
`sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]))`
Let `r = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`.
`sigmoid(k * (-r))`
If `r` is small positive (0.1): `sigmoid(-0.1k)`. If `k=10`, `sigmoid(-1)` ~ 0.27.
If `r` is large positive (5): `sigmoid(-5k)`. If `k=10`, `sigmoid(-50)` ~ 0.
This gives low priority to small residuals and high priority to large residuals. Again, the opposite.

The key is that `sigmoid` is *increasing*. We want a priority that *decreases* with residual capacity.
So the argument to sigmoid must *decrease* as residual capacity increases.
`Argument = f(residual_capacity)` where `f` is a decreasing function.
And we want the steep part of the sigmoid to cover the typical range of `residual_capacity`.

Let's use the inverse of residual capacity, plus a small epsilon for stability, as the argument.
`residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`
`argument = 1.0 / (residual_capacity + epsilon)`
This argument decreases as `residual_capacity` increases.
Now, we need to apply sigmoid. `sigmoid(k * argument)`
If `residual_capacity` is small (0.1), `argument` is large (~10). `k * 10`. If `k` is moderate, e.g., `0.1`, then `argument` is `1`. `sigmoid(1)` ~ 0.73.
If `residual_capacity` is larger (5), `argument` is smaller (~0.2). `k * 0.2`. If `k=0.1`, then `argument` is `0.02`. `sigmoid(0.02)` ~ 0.505.
This works! Small residual gives higher priority.

Now, the tie-breaking.
We want to prefer lower bin indices.
Let `sigmoid_priority = sigmoid(k * (1.0 / (residual_capacity + epsilon)))`.
`total_priority = sigmoid_priority - tie_breaker_weight * bin_indices_that_fit`.
The `tie_breaker_weight` should be small. Let's pick `0.01`.
The `bin_indices_that_fit` are `np.arange(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])[can_fit_mask]`.

We need to determine a reasonable `k`.
The range of `residual_capacity` might depend on the bin capacity and item sizes.
If bin capacity is 10, items are 1-9. Residuals can be 1 to 9.
`1.0 / (residual_capacity + epsilon)` range:
If residual = 1, arg = 1.0/(1+eps) ~ 1.
If residual = 9, arg = 1.0/(9+eps) ~ 0.11.
So `argument` is roughly in [0.11, 1].
We want `sigmoid(k * argument)` to smoothly transition from low to high priority.
If `k=1`, `arg` in [0.11, 1]. `sigmoid(0.11)` ~ 0.53, `sigmoid(1)` ~ 0.73. Too flat.
If `k=5`, `arg` in [0.55, 5]. `sigmoid(0.55)` ~ 0.63, `sigmoid(5)` ~ 0.99. This looks good.
Let's choose `k=5`.

Final check on the logic:
1.  Initialize priorities to `-np.inf`.
2.  Identify bins that can fit: `can_fit_mask`.
3.  Calculate `residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`.
4.  Calculate `epsilon = 1e-9` for stability.
5.  Calculate `argument = 1.0 / (residual_capacity + epsilon)`.
6.  Calculate `k = 5.0` (scaling for sigmoid).
7.  Calculate `sigmoid_priority = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-k * argument))`.
8.  Get indices of bins that fit: `fitting_indices = np.arange(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])[can_fit_mask]`.
9.  Calculate tie-breaker penalty: `tie_breaker_penalty = 0.01 * fitting_indices`.
10. Combine: `priorities[can_fit_mask] = sigmoid_priority - tie_breaker_penalty`.
This seems to fulfill all requirements.

Need to import `numpy`.

Self-reflection on the code:
*   The `sigmoid` helper function is good for numerical stability.
*   Initialization with `-np.inf` correctly handles bins that cannot fit.
*   `can_fit_mask` correctly identifies eligible bins.
*   The calculation `residual_capacity = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item` is correct.
*   The transformation `score_argument = 1.0 / (residual_capacity + epsilon)` correctly makes the argument inversely related to residual capacity.
*   The sigmoid function `sigmoid(k * score_argument)` with `k=5.0` provides a smooth preference for smaller residual capacities. The choice of `k` is heuristic and might need tuning based on typical problem instances.
*   The tie-breaking mechanism `priorities[can_fit_mask] = sigmoid_priorities - tie_breaker_penalties` correctly subtracts a penalty based on the bin index, favoring lower indices.
*   The `tie_breaker_weight` is set to a small value, ensuring it primarily affects ties.
*   The code is efficient, operating only on eligible bins.

The implementation seems solid and addresses the reflection points.
