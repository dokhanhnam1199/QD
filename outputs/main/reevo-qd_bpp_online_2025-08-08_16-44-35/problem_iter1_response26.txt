    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative, the item doesn't fit. We should

    # Let's try mapping `bins_remain_cap` to a score.
    # Bins with `bins_remain_cap >= item` are candidates.
    # Among these, we prefer those closer to `item`.

    # Option 1: Sigmoid of (item - bins_remain_cap), for bins that can fit the item
    # This will give values close to 1 for bins where item is slightly less than bin capacity,
    # and values close to 0 for bins where item is much less than bin capacity (lots of slack).
    # For bins where item doesn't fit (bins_remain_cap < item), the argument becomes positive,
    # resulting in very low sigmoid values, effectively giving them low priority.

    # To prevent potential issues with large negative numbers in exp,
    # we can shift the input. A common approach for fitting is to center around zero.
    # Let's consider the 'slack' `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If slack is negative, the item doesn't fit, priority should be 0.
    # If slack is 0, priority should be high (e.g., 1).

    # If slack is positive and large, priority should be lower.

    # Let's use the `bins_remain_cap` directly and adapt the sigmoid.
    # We want a function f(cap) such that f(item) is high, and f(cap) is low for cap << item or cap >> item.

    # A simple sigmoid: 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (target - x)))
    # Here, our 'target' is the `item` size, and 'x' is `bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want a high score when `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item`.

        # f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-beta * (x - alpha)))
        # We want this function to peak when bins_remain_cap is close to item.
        # Let alpha = item (the desired capacity).
        # Let beta control the steepness. A larger beta means a sharper peak.

        # A simpler approach related to sigmoid behavior for fitting:
        # We want the priority to be high when `bins_remain_cap` is `item`, and
        # decrease as `bins_remain_cap` deviates from `item` in either direction.
        # However, for bin packing, deviation towards larger remaining capacity is less bad
        # than deviation towards smaller capacity (which means item doesn't fit).

        # Let's redefine the goal: prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap` is "just enough" for the item.
        # This implies a preference for smaller remaining capacities among those that can fit the item.
        # The "First Fit Decreasing" strategy (though this is online) suggests fitting into the first bin that works.
        # The "Best Fit" strategy suggests fitting into the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can still fit the item.
        # Our Sigmoid Fit Score should aim for something like "Best Fit" but smoothed.

        # Let's apply a sigmoid to the inverse of the slack `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)`.
        # Or, to the 'tightness' `item / bins_remain_cap` for bins that fit.

        # Let's use the `bins_remain_cap - item` as the argument to the sigmoid,
        # but scale and shift it to put the "sweet spot" for the sigmoid's steepest
        # part around zero difference.

        # `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
        # If we use `x = bins_remain_cap - item`, then for perfect fit x=0, sigmoid is 0.5.
        # For larger remaining capacity (x > 0), sigmoid increases towards 1.
        # For smaller remaining capacity (x < 0), sigmoid decreases towards 0.
        # This doesn't quite capture "best fit" preference.

        # Let's try `sigmoid(- (bins_remain_cap - item)) = sigmoid(item - bins_remain_cap)`.
        # Argument is `item - bins_remain_cap`.
        # If `bins_remain_cap == item`, arg is 0, sigmoid is 0.5.
        # If `bins_remain_cap > item`, arg is negative, sigmoid < 0.5. (Less preferred as it wastes more space).
        # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, arg is positive, sigmoid > 0.5. (This would be preferred, which is wrong if item doesn't fit).

        # We must ensure that items only go into bins where they fit.
        # We can achieve this by multiplying the sigmoid score by a 'fit' indicator (1 if fits, 0 if not).

        # Let's use the sigmoid to represent how "close" the remaining capacity is to the item size,
        # while ensuring the item fits.
        # We want the score to be high when `bins_remain_cap` is small positive, and closer to `item`.
        # This is the "Best Fit" criterion.

        # Consider a function that peaks at `bins_remain_cap = item`.
        # Let's define `f(cap) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (cap - item)))`.
        # This function decreases as `cap` increases from `item`.
        # If `cap = item`, `f(item) = 0.5`.
        # If `cap > item`, `f(cap) < 0.5`. (Less preferred for wasted space)
        # If `cap < item`, `f(cap) > 0.5`. (This is bad if the item doesn't fit).

        # Let's refine:
        # Score for bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
        # Among these, we want to maximize the score when `bins_remain_cap` is minimized.
        # So, we want a function that decreases as `bins_remain_cap` increases.

        # A common transformation for 'best fit' is `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        # We want to minimize this difference.
        # To use a sigmoid, let's map this difference.
        # Let `score_component = item - bins_remain_cap`.
        # This is `0` for perfect fit, positive for more space, negative for less space.
        # `sigmoid(score_component)`:
        # `bins_remain_cap = item` -> `item - item = 0` -> `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`
        # `bins_remain_cap > item` -> `item - bins_remain_cap < 0` -> `sigmoid(<0) < 0.5` (lower priority)
        # `bins_remain_cap < item` -> `item - bins_remain_cap > 0` -> `sigmoid(>0) > 0.5` (higher priority)

        # This still prioritizes bins where the item *doesn't* fit if we use it naively.
        # The "Sigmoid Fit Score" usually implies finding a "good fit" using a sigmoid curve.
        # The key is often a normalized difference.

        # Let's re-interpret "Sigmoid Fit Score" as a measure of how well the item *fits* into the bin.
        # A good fit means the remaining capacity is just slightly larger than the item.
        # Let `diff = bins_remain_cap - item`.
        # If `diff < 0`, the item doesn't fit. Priority is 0.
        # If `diff == 0`, perfect fit. Max priority.
        # If `diff > 0` and small, high priority.
        # If `diff > 0` and large, lower priority (waste of space).

        # We can model this with a sigmoid that is peaked.
        # A bell-shaped curve can be approximated by `sigmoid(x) * (1 - sigmoid(x))`.
        # Or a Gaussian. But the request is "Sigmoid Fit Score".

        # Let's use `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))` and filter for valid bins.
        # This function is higher when `bins_remain_cap` is smaller (and less than item).
        # This is the opposite of what we want for "Best Fit".

        # A better candidate for "Best Fit" using sigmoid:
        # We want high score when `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and non-negative.
        # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
        # We want `g(x)` to be high for `x` close to 0 (and `x>=0`).
        # Consider the sigmoid `sigmoid(alpha * (item - cap))`.
        # For `cap >= item`, `item - cap <= 0`.
        # `sigmoid(alpha * (item - cap))` will be >= 0.5.
        # As `cap` increases (more slack), `item - cap` becomes more negative,
        # and `sigmoid` approaches 0. This gives lower priority for more slack, which is good for "Best Fit".

        # Let's use `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`.
        # `k` controls how sensitive the score is to the difference.
        # Let's scale the `item - bins_remain_cap` to map it effectively to the sigmoid's useful range.
        # If we expect `bins_remain_cap - item` to range from 0 to, say, `bin_capacity`,
        # then `item - bins_remain_cap` ranges from 0 to `-bin_capacity`.
        # The sigmoid is sensitive around 0. We want our "best fit" to be near 0.

        # Let's normalize the difference by the item size or bin capacity, perhaps.
        # `scaled_diff = (item - bins_remain_cap) / item` (if item > 0)
        # `scaled_diff = (item - bins_remain_cap) / max(1, item)`
        # `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-scaled_diff[can_fit_mask]))`

        # Let's simplify: The idea is to prioritize bins that have remaining capacity
        # closest to the item size, provided they are large enough.
        # `Best Fit` heuristic: Select the bin with the minimum `bins_remain_cap` such that `bins_remain_cap >= item`.

        # Sigmoid Fit Score: model this preference using a sigmoid.
        # A sigmoid typically maps to [0, 1].
        # Let's aim for:
        # - High priority for bins where `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`.
        # - Lower priority for bins where `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`.
        # - Zero priority for bins where `bins_remain_cap < item`.

        # If `cap > item`, `item - cap < 0`, `f(cap) < 0.5`.
        # If `cap < item`, `item - cap > 0`, `f(cap) > 0.5`.

        # To ensure items don't go into bins where they don't fit (where `cap < item`),
        # we can set their sigmoid score to a very low value, or simply 0.
        # And for bins where `cap >= item`, we want the score to decrease as `cap` increases.
        # This means `f(cap) = sigmoid(a * (item - cap))` works if `a > 0`.

        # Let `a = 1.0` (a default sensitivity).
        # We need to handle potential numerical issues with `exp`.

        # Calculate `item - bins_remain_cap` for fitting bins.
        # `arg = item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]`
        # `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-arg))`

        # To make it more "Sigmoid Fit Score" and capture the "best fit" idea,
        # let's normalize `item - bins_remain_cap` to control the steepness.
        # A common scaling factor is related to the typical range of differences.
        # If `bins_remain_cap` can vary significantly, a fixed `a` might be too steep or too shallow.

        # Let's assume `item` is positive and `bins_remain_cap` are non-negative.
        # For bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
        # Let `relative_slack = (bins_remain_cap - item) / item` (if item > 0) or `bins_remain_cap / max(1, item)`.
        # We want smaller `relative_slack` to give higher scores.
        # So, `sigmoid(k * (-relative_slack))` might be a good candidate.
        # `k` is a sensitivity parameter.

        # A simpler interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score" often involves using the
        # ratio `item / bins_remain_cap`. This ratio is close to 1 for good fits.
        # However, this doesn't handle the "item does not fit" case gracefully unless filtered.

        # Let's try using the normalized difference scaled by `item`:
        # `diff_from_item = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`
        # `normalized_diff = diff_from_item / item` (if item > 0)
        # A good fit means `normalized_diff` is close to 0.
        # `sigmoid(-k * normalized_diff)` or `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap) / item)`

        # Let's simplify the argument to avoid division by item, which can be zero.
        # Use `item - bins_remain_cap` directly as the argument.
        # To make the sigmoid sensitive around the "perfect fit" point (`bins_remain_cap = item`),
        # we need to scale the argument.
        # Consider a standard sigmoid transformation: `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.
        # We want `x = item - bins_remain_cap` to be around 0 for a good fit.
        # If `bins_remain_cap` can be very large, `item - bins_remain_cap` can be a large negative number.
        # If `bins_remain_cap` is just slightly larger than `item`, `item - bins_remain_cap` is a small negative number.

        # Let's try mapping `bins_remain_cap` such that `item` maps to the center (0.5),
        # values slightly larger than `item` map to values less than 0.5 (but still positive),
        # and values much larger than `item` map to values close to 0.
        # And for `bins_remain_cap < item`, the score is 0.

        # `sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))` seems to be the most direct interpretation for "Sigmoid Fit Score" targeting "Best Fit".
        # The sensitivity `k` is crucial. Let's set it to a reasonable value.
        # `k = 1.0` is a common starting point.
        # To avoid potential issues where `item - bins_remain_cap` is extremely large negative or positive,
        # we can clip the argument to the sigmoid, or use a scaled version.
        # Let's scale by `item` if `item > 0`. If `item` is 0, `item - bins_remain_cap` is `-bins_remain_cap`.

        # A common heuristic for "best fit" using a smoothed approach involves penalizing slack.
        # The priority for a bin `i` could be proportional to `sigmoid(C - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))`,
        # where `C` is a constant. If `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small, the argument is large.

        # Let's refine the sigmoid function to ensure the output is reasonable.
        # We are applying it to the difference `item - bins_remain_cap`.
        # Let `val = item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]`.
        # We want high scores when `val` is close to 0 or slightly negative (meaning `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`).
        # `sigmoid(val)`:
        # If `val = 0` (`bins_remain_cap = item`), score = 0.5.
        # If `val < 0` (`bins_remain_cap > item`), score < 0.5.
        # If `val > 0` (`bins_remain_cap < item`), score > 0.5.

        # To align with "Best Fit" (preferring minimum sufficient capacity):
        # We want score to be high when `bins_remain_cap` is close to `item` from above.
        # `f(cap) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (cap - item)))`
        # If `cap = item`, `f(item) = 0.5`.
        # If `cap > item`, `cap - item > 0`, `f(cap) < 0.5`. This score decreases as slack increases. Good.
        # If `cap < item`, `cap - item < 0`, `f(cap) > 0.5`. This implies preference for bins that are too small, which is wrong.

        # Let's combine the "fit" check and the score calculation.
        # For bins where `bins_remain_cap < item`, priority is 0.
        # For bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
        # We want to prioritize smaller `bins_remain_cap`.
        # Let's use `bins_remain_cap - item` as the input to a function that decays.
        # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` increases with `x`.
        # So we need an input that increases as `bins_remain_cap` decreases.
        # Let the input be `item - bins_remain_cap`. This is still problematic if `bins_remain_cap < item`.

        # Final approach: Use the standard sigmoid form `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.
        # Let `x = k * (target_value - actual_value)`.
        # Our `actual_value` is `bins_remain_cap`.
        # Our `target_value` for a perfect fit is `item`.
        # So, `x = k * (item - bins_remain_cap)`.
        # This provides:
        # - `x > 0` when `bins_remain_cap < item` (high score, bad if they don't fit)
        # - `x = 0` when `bins_remain_cap = item` (score = 0.5)
        # - `x < 0` when `bins_remain_cap > item` (score < 0.5, lower as bins_remain_cap increases)

        # To make this "Sigmoid Fit Score" and correctly handle non-fitting bins:
        # 1. Only calculate scores for bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
        # 2. For these bins, use a sigmoid that penalizes excess capacity.
        # The function `1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))` does this.
        # Here, if `bins_remain_cap = item`, arg = 0, score = 0.5.
        # If `bins_remain_cap > item`, arg > 0, score < 0.5. Score decreases as `bins_remain_cap` increases.
        # If `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`, score is slightly less than 0.5.
        # If `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`, score is close to 0.

        # The sensitivity `k` determines how quickly the priority drops for bins with excess capacity.
        # Let's choose `k=1.0` as a default.

        # Compute the argument for the sigmoid.
        # We only care about bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
        # Let `diff_slack = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`
        # We want a function of `diff_slack` that is high for small `diff_slack`.
        # Sigmoid of `-diff_slack` could work.
        # `sigmoid(-diff_slack)` = `1 / (1 + exp(diff_slack))`.

        # Let's try to map `bins_remain_cap` to a score where the peak is at `item`.
        # Use `bins_remain_cap` directly in a sigmoid but shifted and scaled.
        # Let `k` be a sensitivity parameter.
        # `priorities[can_fit_mask] = sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]))`
        # This means for `bins_remain_cap = item`, we get 0.5.
        # For `bins_remain_cap > item` (more slack), we get less than 0.5.
        # For `bins_remain_cap < item` (doesn't fit), we get more than 0.5. This is the issue.

        # Let's combine the best-fit idea with the sigmoid.
        # For bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
        # Priority is inversely related to the remaining capacity.
        # `priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item + 1e-6)` - Not sigmoid.

        # Final decision for `priority_v2`:
        # Apply sigmoid to the `bins_remain_cap - item` difference for bins that fit.
        # We want higher scores for smaller differences.
        # Sigmoid of `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` or `item - bins_remain_cap`.
        # To make this effective for "Best Fit", we need to ensure that:
        # 1. Items only go into bins they fit in.
        # 2. Among fitting bins, smaller remaining capacity is preferred.

        # Let's use `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
        # Where `k` is a positive sensitivity parameter.
        # If `bins_remain_cap < item`: The expression `bins_remain_cap - item` is negative.
        # `exp(negative)` is small. `1 + small` is close to 1. `1 / (1 + small)` is close to 1.
        # This means bins that are too small get high priority, which is incorrect.

        # A better formulation for best fit using sigmoid:
        # Consider the ratio of item size to remaining capacity: `item / bins_remain_cap`.
        # For perfect fit, this is 1. For more capacity, this is < 1. For less capacity, this is > 1.
        # We want values close to 1, but also handle the "doesn't fit" case.
        # Let `ratios = item / bins_remain_cap`.
        # We are interested in `ratios` near 1, for cases where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
        # Let `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (ratios - 1)))`.
        # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
        #   `ratios <= 1`.
        #   `ratios - 1 <= 0`.
        #   If `ratios = 1` (perfect fit), `exp(0)=1`, score = 0.5.
        #   If `ratios < 1` (more capacity), `ratios - 1 < 0`, `exp(<0) < 1`, score > 0.5.
        #   This prioritizes bins with *more* capacity, opposite of best fit.

        # Let's try `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - 1)))`
        # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`:
        #   `ratios <= 1`.
        #   `ratios - 1 <= 0`.
        #   If `ratios = 1` (perfect fit), `exp(0)=1`, score = 0.5.
        #   If `ratios < 1` (more capacity), `ratios - 1 < 0`, `exp(<0) < 1`, score > 0.5. Still problematic.

        # The problem is that sigmoid increases. We need something that decreases.
        # Let's use the inverse: `1 / (1 + exp(-k * (1 - ratios)))` = `1 / (1 + exp(k * (ratios - 1)))`.
        # This is the same function, still doesn't capture best fit.

        # The key is often to transform the variable to be something that, when put into a standard sigmoid,
        # results in the desired priority.
        # For "Best Fit", we want to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item` for `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
        # Let `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want to minimize `slack`.
        # Let `k` be a sensitivity parameter.
        # Sigmoid of `-k * slack`.
        # `sigmoid(-k * slack)` = `1 / (1 + exp(k * slack))`
        # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`, then `slack >= 0`.
        #   If `slack = 0` (perfect fit), `exp(0)=1`, score = 0.5.
        #   If `slack > 0` (more capacity), `exp(>0) > 1`, score < 0.5. Score decreases as slack increases. This is good for Best Fit.
        #   If `slack` is very large, score approaches 0.

        # This seems like the most suitable interpretation for "Sigmoid Fit Score" for "Best Fit" strategy.
        # We apply this only to bins that can fit the item.

        sensitivity = 1.0  # Controls how sharp the priority drop is for slack

        # Calculate slack for fitting bins
        slack = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

        # Calculate priority using sigmoid: 1 / (1 + exp(sensitivity * slack))
        # This means:
        # - Perfect fit (slack=0): priority = 0.5
        # - Positive slack (bins_remain_cap > item): priority < 0.5, decreasing with slack
        # - Negative slack (item doesn't fit): This case is excluded by `can_fit_mask`.
        #
        # We need to handle cases where `bins_remain_cap - item` can be very large or very small.
        # If `slack` is very large positive, `exp(sensitivity * slack)` becomes very large, score ~ 0.
        # If `slack` is very large negative (e.g., item almost fits, but `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`),
        # `exp(sensitivity * slack)` becomes very small, score ~ 1. This seems counter-intuitive for "best fit".

        # Re-thinking the goal: "Bin with the highest priority score will be selected."
        # For Best Fit, we want the bin with the *least* remaining capacity that still fits the item.
        # This means we want to maximize a function that is high when `bins_remain_cap` is minimal and `bins_remain_cap >= item`.

        # Let's consider the complementary problem: penalize slack.
        # The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-x))` increases.
        # We want to input something that increases as `slack` decreases.
        # Input `k * (C - slack)`. Let `C = 0`. Input `-k * slack`.
        # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * slack))`
        # `slack = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item`
        # If `slack = 0` (perfect fit): score = 0.5
        # If `slack > 0` (more slack): `-k * slack < 0`. `exp(<0) < 1`. `score > 0.5`.
        # This prioritizes bins with MORE slack. This is NOT "Best Fit".

        # The common interpretation of Sigmoid Fit Score in some contexts aims for a balance.
        # It doesn't strictly adhere to "Best Fit" but favors bins that are "close enough".

        # Let's use the structure `1 / (1 + exp(k * (value)))` where `value` is engineered.
        # We want to prioritize `bins_remain_cap` close to `item`.
        # Let's transform `bins_remain_cap` by subtracting `item`.
        # For `bins_remain_cap >= item`, `bins_remain_cap - item` is `slack >= 0`.
        # We want a score that is high for small `slack`.
        # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))` with `k>0`
        # If `bins_remain_cap = item`, score = 0.5.
        # If `bins_remain_cap > item`, `bins_remain_cap - item > 0`, score < 0.5.
        # This score decreases as remaining capacity increases. This favors "Best Fit".

        # Let's consider the range of `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        # If `item` is 10, and `bins_remain_cap` can be 10, 11, 15, 20.
        # Differences: 0, 1, 5, 10.
        # Sigmoid of `-k * diff`:
        # k=1:
        # diff=0: sigmoid(0) = 0.5
        # diff=1: sigmoid(-1) = 0.2689
        # diff=5: sigmoid(-5) = 0.0067
        # diff=10: sigmoid(-10) = 0.000045

        # This looks good. It strongly penalizes bins with significant excess capacity.
        # We need to select `k` appropriately. A larger `k` means a sharper drop.
        # A value of `k=1.0` seems reasonable as a starting point.

        # Calculate argument for sigmoid: `sensitivity * (item - bins_remain_cap)`
        # For bins that can fit, `item - bins_remain_cap` is non-positive.
        arg_values = sensitivity * (item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask])

        # Apply sigmoid function. `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`.
        # Where `x = arg_values`.
        # The formula is `1 / (1 + np.exp(-arg_values))`
        # This is equivalent to `1 / (1 + np.exp( -sensitivity * (item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]) ))`
        # which simplifies to `1 / (1 + np.exp( sensitivity * (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item) ))`.
        # This is indeed the function that decreases as slack (`bins_remain_cap - item`) increases.

        # Ensure stability for `np.exp`. Arguments to `np.exp` should not be extremely large positive or negative.
        # `bins_remain_cap - item` could be large.
        # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is very large positive, `exp` could overflow.
        # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is very large negative, `exp` can underflow to 0.

        # Let's cap the exponent to prevent overflow.
        # The typical range for `exp(x)` is about -700 to 700.
        # If `sensitivity * (bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item)` is `z`.
        # We want `exp(z)` to be calculated.
        # If `z` is very large positive, `exp(z)` will overflow. This happens when `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`.
        # In this case, the score should approach 0.
        # If `z` is very large negative, `exp(z)` is ~0. This happens when `bins_remain_cap` is slightly larger than `item`.
        # In this case, the score approaches 1. This is still problematic.

        # The issue is that `1 / (1 + exp(large_positive))` is close to 0.
        # And `1 / (1 + exp(large_negative))` is close to 1.

        # Let's re-evaluate `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`.
        # `k=1`, `item=10`.
        # `cap=10`: slack=0, score = 1/(1+exp(0)) = 0.5
        # `cap=11`: slack=1, score = 1/(1+exp(1)) = 1/(1+2.718) = 0.2689
        # `cap=15`: slack=5, score = 1/(1+exp(5)) = 1/(1+148.4) = 0.0067
        # `cap=20`: slack=10, score = 1/(1+exp(10)) = 1/(1+22026) = 0.000045
        # This is prioritizing smaller slack, which is Best Fit.

        # The problematic case is when `bins_remain_cap - item` becomes very negative.
        # Example: item=100, bin_cap=10. `bins_remain_cap=10`.
        # `bins_remain_cap - item` = -90.
        # `score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * -90))` = `1 / (1 + exp(-90))`. `exp(-90)` is extremely small.
        # Score becomes ~1. This implies a very small bin (that doesn't fit the item) gets high priority if we didn't filter.

        # Since we filter `can_fit_mask`, we only apply this to `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
        # So `bins_remain_cap - item >= 0`.
        # `k * (bins_remain_cap - item)` will always be non-negative if `k > 0`.
        # So `exp` will be `>= 1`.
        # The problem of `exp` overflowing can happen if `k * (bins_remain_cap - item)` is very large.
        # If `k * slack > 700`, `exp` might overflow.
        # For example, if `k=10` and `slack=71`, `exp(710)` overflows.
        # If `k=1` and `slack=701`, `exp(701)` overflows.
        # The score should approach 0 in these cases.

        # We can cap the argument to `np.exp`.
        # Let `exponent_arg = sensitivity * slack`.
        # `capped_exp_arg = np.clip(exponent_arg, -700, 700)` (adjust range as needed for robustness)
        # But we only care about `slack >= 0`. So `exponent_arg >= 0`.
        # We only need to worry about large positive `exponent_arg` causing overflow.
        # If `exponent_arg` is very large, `exp(exponent_arg)` becomes effectively infinity, and the score becomes 0.
        # This is desired.

        # Let's cap the argument at a value that ensures `exp` doesn't overflow but stays large.
        # `max_exp_arg = 100` (or some suitable value).
        # If `exponent_arg > max_exp_arg`, we can treat `exp(exponent_arg)` as infinity.

        capped_slack_term = sensitivity * slack
        # If `bins_remain_cap` is very large, `slack` is large, `capped_slack_term` is large.
        # `np.exp(large_positive)` -> overflow. Result is inf.
        # `1 / (1 + inf)` -> 0. This is the correct behavior.
        # So no explicit capping might be needed for overflow if `np.inf` is handled correctly.

        # To avoid `np.inf` in the denominator: `1 + np.inf` is `np.inf`.
        # `1 / np.inf` is `0`. This is fine.

        # Let's explicitly set priority to 0 for cases where `slack` is extremely large,
        # to avoid potential `inf` calculations and ensure behavior.
        # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is >, say, 1000 (if sensitivity is 1), it's a very bad fit.
        # Let's clip `bins_remain_cap - item` to a maximum value before multiplying by sensitivity.
        clipped_slack = np.clip(slack, 0, 1000.0) # Cap slack at 1000.0

        exponent_argument = sensitivity * clipped_slack
        # Ensure exponent_argument is not excessively large.
        # We are calculating `1 / (1 + exp(x))` where `x >= 0`.
        # `x` can be large. If `x=709`, `exp(x)` is near max float.
        # If `x > 709`, `exp(x)` might be `inf`.
        # A simple way to manage is to use `np.finfo(float).max` for `exp` argument.
        # Or if `exponent_argument` is large, the result is effectively 0.

        # Let's simplify and rely on numpy's handling of large exponents.
        # If `exponent_argument` leads to `inf` in `exp`, the result is `1 / (1 + inf) = 0`.

        # The `priority_v2` is a Sigmoid Best Fit score.
        # It prioritizes bins with remaining capacity closest to the item size,
        # preferring minimal waste.

        # applied to bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.

        priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(sensitivity * slack))

        # To ensure that bins with large remaining capacity (large slack) get very low priority,
        # and to potentially avoid `inf` in `np.exp`, we can clip the argument.
        # If `slack` is very large, say `> 100` and `sensitivity=1`, `exp(100)` is huge, score is ~0.
        # If `bins_remain_cap` is large, like the bin capacity, and item is small, slack can be large.
        # E.g., item=1, bin_cap=100. slack=99. exp(99) is huge.
        # The score should indeed be near 0.

        # Let's re-evaluate sensitivity. If `sensitivity = 0.1`, the drop is slower.
        # if `sensitivity = 10`, the drop is very fast.
        # `k=1` is a reasonable balance.
