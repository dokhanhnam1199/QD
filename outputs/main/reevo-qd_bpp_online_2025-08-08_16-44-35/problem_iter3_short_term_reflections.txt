Prioritize tight fits; use smooth functions like sigmoid for gradual preference.
Prioritize minimal waste. Negative remaining capacity scores optimize for tightest fits.
Prioritize "tight fits" for minimal waste, but ensure items always fit.
Prioritize snug fits; minimize remaining capacity for better bin utilization.
Prioritize bins with minimal leftover space for the item.
Prioritize bins by minimizing remaining capacity after fitting.
Prioritize tightest fits, then lower indices. Avoid zero differences for better scoring.
Prioritize small, positive differences. Use smooth functions like sigmoid for nuanced scores.
Prioritize bins with minimal excess capacity using a sigmoid function, ensuring items fit.
Prioritize bins by minimizing slack, using sigmoid for smooth preference.
