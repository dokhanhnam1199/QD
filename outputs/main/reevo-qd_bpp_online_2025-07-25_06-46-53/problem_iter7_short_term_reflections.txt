Use weighted combinations and smooth functions.
Consider near-full bins and exact fits.
Softened exact fit score improves performance.
Simplify and focus on key factors, like difference and capacity.
Prioritize perfect fits, minimize waste, and penalize poor fits.
Simplify and focus on key factors, like difference and remaining capacity.
Simplify and focus on minimizing waste and prioritizing near-full bins.
Prioritize perfect fits, minimize waste, and penalize poor fits.
Prioritize ratio, exact fits, and penalize excess capacity.
Combine multiple factors with weighted priorities.
