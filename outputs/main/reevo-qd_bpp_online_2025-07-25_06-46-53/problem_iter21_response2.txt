    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to prioritize near-full bins, simplify weights, 
    and focus on key factors like remaining capacity and size differences to minimize 
    waste and optimize online Bin Packing performance.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
