    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to minimize waste and prioritize bins 
    that are almost full, thereby reducing the number of bins needed.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
