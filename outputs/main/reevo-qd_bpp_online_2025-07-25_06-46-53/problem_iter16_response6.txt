def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to encourage the packing of items into bins 
    where the item size is closest to the remaining capacity, thereby minimizing waste.
    It combines ratio, difference, and exact fit considerations with balanced priorities, 
    prioritizing near-full bins and minimal waste.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    capacity_ratio = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-8)  # add a small value to avoid division by zero
