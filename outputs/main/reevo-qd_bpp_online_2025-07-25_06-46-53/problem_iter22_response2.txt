    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to prioritize near-full bins and minimize waste.
    It combines difference and ratio considerations with weighted priorities, 
    emphasizing near-full bins and minimal waste.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
