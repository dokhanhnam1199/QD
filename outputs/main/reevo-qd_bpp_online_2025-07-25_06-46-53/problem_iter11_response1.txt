    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to prioritize near-full bins, minimize waste, and simplify weights.
    It balances remaining capacity and weighted priorities for optimal online Bin Packing heuristics performance.

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
