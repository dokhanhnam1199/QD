    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to encourage the packing of items into bins 
    where the item size is closest to the remaining capacity, thereby minimizing waste.
    It prioritizes ratio over difference, near-full bins, and exact fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the inverse differences to give higher priority to bins with smaller differences
    inv_diff = 1 / (np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item) + 1e-8)
    
    # Calculate the priority score as a combination of the ratio and the inverse differences
