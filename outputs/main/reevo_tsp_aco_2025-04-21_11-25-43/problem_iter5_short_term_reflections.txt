Focus on neighbor-based penalties, global normalization, and percentile-based dynamic sparsification for improved heuristics.

Adaptive node preference, symmetry, controlled randomness, and distance-based sparsification improve heuristic quality.

The better code uses local normalization (row/column means) and adaptive sparsification, crucial for TSP heuristic design.

K-nearest neighbors, connectivity bonuses, and penalizing long edges improve TSP heuristic quality.

Node-specific sparsification, geometric mean for centrality, and a touch of randomness appear beneficial.

Better heuristics use adaptive node preference, percentile-based sparsification, and avoid excessive clipping/normalization.

Better heuristics:
- Use raw distances directly.
- Focus sparsification on a fixed threshold.
- Adjust parameters to control exploration.

Sparsification, appropriate normalization, and simpler node degree incorporation improved the heuristic.

Adaptive sparsification, degree centrality, distance emphasis, and normalization improve heuristic quality.

Dynamic thresholds, degree centrality, adaptive sparsification, and normalization boost heuristic performance by balancing exploration and exploitation.
