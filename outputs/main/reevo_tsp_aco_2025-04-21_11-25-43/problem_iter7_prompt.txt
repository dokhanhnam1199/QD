TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nPrioritize sparsification with adaptive thresholds and node degree. Use raw or inverse square distances. Favor local (row/column) normalization. Penalize geometric mean centrality and control randomness. Combine useful centrality features cautiously.\n- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\n\n[Code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics for TSP based on distance, degree centrality, and sparsification.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n\n    # Initialize the heuristic matrix with the inverse of the distance\n    heuristic_matrix = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-9)\n\n    # Degree centrality heuristic\n    degree_centrality = np.sum(1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-9), axis=1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] *= (degree_centrality[i] + degree_centrality[j]) / 2\n\n    # Sparsification\n    avg_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix)\n    sparsification_threshold = 1.5 * avg_distance\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if distance_matrix[i, j] > sparsification_threshold:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0\n    heuristic_matrix = heuristic_matrix / (distance_matrix**2 + 1e-9)\n\n    # Normalize the heuristic matrix to a range of 0 to 1\n    max_val = np.max(heuristic_matrix)\n    min_val = np.min(heuristic_matrix)\n\n    if max_val > min_val:\n        heuristic_matrix = (heuristic_matrix - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n    else:\n        heuristic_matrix = np.ones_like(heuristic_matrix) * 0.5\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\n[Improved code]\nPlease write a mutated function `heuristics_v2`, according to the reflection.
