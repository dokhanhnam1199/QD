Geometric centrality, adaptive sparsification, local normalization, and controlled randomness improve heuristic quality.

Geometric mean centrality, adaptive sparsification with percentile, local normalization, and distance-squared scaling improve heuristic quality.

Sparsification adapts better to local data. Normalization and centrality weighting improve stability.

Sparsification, degree centrality, randomness, and normalization are crucial. Adaptive thresholds and parameter tuning improve performance.

Dynamic sparsification, tuned normalization, and controlled randomness enhance TSP heuristic performance.

Geometric mean centrality, adaptive sparsification with percentile threshold, and targeted normalization improved performance.

Dynamic sparsification, refined normalization, and tuned randomness improve heuristic guidance in stochastic TSP solvers.

Sparsification, adaptive thresholds, tuned scaling, and controlled randomness are key to better TSP heuristics.

Incorporate geometric centrality, dynamic sparsification, row/column normalization, and distance-based adjustments for improved edge prioritization.

Distance weighting, adaptive sparsification, degree centrality integration, and iterative normalization enhance heuristic performance.
