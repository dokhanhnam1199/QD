Prioritize effective feature combination and normalization. Sparsification and centrality measures improve performance.

Focus on inverse square distance, normalized degree centrality, adaptive sparsification, and local normalization.

Prioritize inverse distance, adaptive sparsification, mild randomness, and refined normalization/scaling.

Sparsification via element-wise comparison and geometric mean centrality improves heuristic quality.

Sparsification and local normalization are key. Geometric mean centrality and degree centrality fusion can improve performance.

Refine sparsification thresholds, reduce randomness, and carefully tune normalization and edge weighting exponents.

Dynamic sparsification, adaptive weighting, and tuned normalization enhance TSP heuristic performance.

Consider inverse distance, adaptive sparsification, local normalization, randomness, pheromones, and symmetry.

Combining centrality measures effectively, sparsification, local normalization, and controlled randomness improves heuristic quality.

Refine sparsification, reduce randomness, and carefully tune parameters for better exploration-exploitation balance in heuristics.
