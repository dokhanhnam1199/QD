Focus on nearest neighbors, balance penalties/rewards, sparsify effectively, and ensure symmetry.

Consider k-nearest neighbors, penalize long edges, and ensure connectivity. Avoid hard thresholds and local percentiles.

Incorporate node preferences, randomness, and percentile-based sparsification for improved exploration and solution quality.

Better heuristic: Adaptive scaling, dynamic sparsity, and a degree penalty promote exploration and focus the search.

The better code incorporates node-specific information, and focuses on more aggressive, node-dependent sparsification and symmetrization.

The better code normalizes distances globally, dynamically sparsifies, and uses neighbor counts for degree penalty instead of static degrees.

Nearest neighbor prioritization, adaptive thresholding, and symmetry enforcement improve heuristic quality.

Prioritize nearest neighbors, add randomness, and sparsify based on quantiles for better exploration.

Sparsification via adaptive k, and using row/column means for edge prioritization improve heuristic quality.

Better heuristics use node degree, randomness, normalization, and re-normalization after sparsification for robust edge selection.
