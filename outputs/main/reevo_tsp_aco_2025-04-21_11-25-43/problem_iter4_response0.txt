def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Heuristic function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

    This version refines the heuristics by incorporating global distance normalization,
    dynamic sparsification based on percentiles, and a node degree penalty based on
    neighbor counts, aiming for better exploration and solution quality.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A square matrix where `distance_matrix[i, j]`
            represents the distance between node `i` and node `j`.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A matrix of the same shape as `distance_matrix`, where each
            element indicates the heuristic value (promise) of including the
            corresponding edge in a TSP solution. Higher values indicate a more
            promising edge.
