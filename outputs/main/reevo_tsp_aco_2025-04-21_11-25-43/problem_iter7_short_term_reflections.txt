Adaptive sparsification, degree centrality, and refined normalization/scaling improve TSP heuristic performance.

Sparsification, dynamic thresholds, degree centrality, and controlled randomness improve TSP heuristics.

Geometric mean centrality multiplication, targeted normalization, and sparsification contribute to the improved heuristic.

Geometric centrality penalization, combined row/column normalization, and inverse square distance weighting improve heuristic quality.

Geometric/harmonic means, degree centrality, adaptive sparsification, local normalization, and final distance adjustment improve TSP heuristics.

Geometric mean centrality, local normalization, and randomness hurt performance. Sparsification and degree centrality improve it.

Sparsification, geometric mean, adaptive thresholds, local normalization, and final distance adjustments improve heuristic quality.

Sparsification, inverse distance, and node degree (row/column means) are useful. Avoid geometric centrality and excessive randomness.

Centrality measures, adaptive sparsification, local normalization, and distance-based adjustments improve TSP heuristic performance.

Geometric mean centrality penalization, combined centrality features, and distance-squared scaling improved heuristic quality.
