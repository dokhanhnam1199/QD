    Heuristics function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

    This version combines several factors to estimate the desirability of each edge:
    - Inverse distance: Shorter edges are generally preferred.
    - Node degree:  Avoids edges that would lead to high-degree nodes early on.  (Not directly implemented due to lack of intermediate state)
    - Sparsification: Sets the least promising edges to zero to focus the search.
