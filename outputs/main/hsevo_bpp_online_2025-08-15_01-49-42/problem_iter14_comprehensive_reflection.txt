Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Fit, Slack, Normalization, Differentiation, Hierarchy.
*   **Advice:** Design scoring mechanisms that clearly distinguish between exact fits and various degrees of near-fits using normalized metrics. Establish a clear hierarchy of criteria, prioritizing exact fits, then minimal normalized slack, with tunable parameters for adaptability.
*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary penalties, direct division by zero or very small numbers without stabilization (epsilon), overly complex multi-objective functions without justification, and counter-intuitive negative scaling.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection in heuristic design centers on creating clear, robust scoring that prioritizes ideal outcomes while robustly differentiating between good-enough alternatives, ensuring numerical stability and intuitive logic.
