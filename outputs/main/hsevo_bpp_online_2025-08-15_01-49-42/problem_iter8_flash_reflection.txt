**Analysis:**

*   **Heuristics 1 vs 2:** Heuristic 1 prioritizes exact fits (score 1.0) and then uses an inverse of remaining capacity for others. Heuristic 2 implements a BFD-inspired approach, maximizing negative remaining capacity and using negative initial slack as a tie-breaker, scaled by a large factor. Heuristic 1's scoring for non-exact fits (1/(remaining+1)) is simpler but might not distinguish as well as Heuristic 2's combined score. Heuristic 2's explicit tie-breaking and scaling seem more robust for BFD.

*   **Heuristics 2 vs 5:** Heuristic 2 uses a scaled combination of minimizing remaining capacity and minimizing initial slack. Heuristic 5 focuses solely on minimizing remaining capacity (equivalent to maximizing negative remaining capacity). Heuristic 2's tie-breaking mechanism (considering initial slack) adds a refinement that Heuristic 5 lacks, potentially leading to better packing in cases of identical minimum remainders.

*   **Heuristics 5 vs 7:** These heuristics appear to be identical in their core logic: prioritizing bins that leave the minimum remaining capacity after fitting an item. Both assign a score as the negative of the remaining capacity after fit.

*   **Heuristics 1 vs 9:** Heuristic 1 rewards exact fits with 1.0 and uses inverse remaining capacity for others. Heuristic 9 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and then uses a normalized slack (remaining / current capacity) for non-exact fits, scaled to be between 0.5 and 0.99. Heuristic 9's normalization and scaling for non-exact fits offer a more nuanced approach than Heuristic 1's simple inverse.

*   **Heuristics 9 vs 10:** Heuristics 9 and 10 are identical. They both prioritize exact fits with 1.0 and then use a scaled normalized slack (1 - normalized_slack) for non-exact fits, mapping to [0.5, 0.99].

*   **Heuristics 10 vs 14:** Heuristic 10 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and then uses a scaled normalized slack (1 - normalized_slack) for non-exact fits, mapping to [0.5, 0.99]. Heuristic 14 also prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses (1 - normalized slack) for non-exact fits, but these scores are not explicitly scaled to a range like [0.5, 0.99], implying they could be [0, 1). Both use normalized slack, but Heuristic 10's explicit scaling might offer more control.

*   **Heuristics 14 vs 16:** Heuristic 14 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses `1.0 - normalized_slack` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 16 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses `0.5 * (1.0 - normalized_slack)` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 16's scaling factor of 0.5 ensures non-exact fits are always distinctly lower than exact fits, potentially offering clearer separation.

*   **Heuristics 16 vs 17:** Heuristic 16 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses `0.5 * (1.0 - normalized_slack)` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 17 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and then uses `1.0 + (1.0 / (normalized_slack + 1e-9))` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 17's scoring for non-exact fits is much higher and seems to invert the normalized slack, making smaller slack yield larger scores. This approach might overvalue non-exact fits.

*   **Heuristics 17 vs 15:** Heuristic 17 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses `1.0 + (1.0 / (normalized_slack + 1e-9))` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 15 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses `1.0 + (1.0 / (normalized_slack + 1e-9))` for non-exact fits. These appear identical.

*   **Heuristics 15 vs 18:** Heuristic 15 prioritizes exact fits with 1.0 and uses `1.0 + (1.0 / (normalized_slack + 1e-9))` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 18 prioritizes exact fits with a very high score (1e6) and then uses `-normalized_slack * 1e5` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 18's high score for exact fits and negative scaling for non-exact fits is a different approach. The negative scaling for non-exact fits is unusual for "higher score = higher priority."

*   **Heuristics 18 vs 20:** Heuristics 18 and 20 are identical. They prioritize exact fits with a very high score (1e6) and then use `-normalized_slack * 1e5` for non-exact fits, which appears to have the intention of maximizing the negative normalized slack (minimizing slack).

*   **Heuristics 19 vs 20:** Heuristic 19 is incomplete but aims for exact fits with a specific score and inverse slack. Heuristic 20 prioritizes exact fits with a very high score (1e6) and then uses `-normalized_slack * 1e5` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 20's explicit high score for exact fits and the negative scaling for non-exact fits are concrete implementations.

*   **Overall:** Heuristics 2 and 10/9/14/16 offer robust BFD-like strategies by combining primary (minimizing residual/slack) and secondary (initial slack) objectives or by using normalized slack. Heuristics 18/20 have a clear hierarchy with a very high score for exact fits and negative scaled slack for others, but the negative scaling for priority is counter-intuitive. Heuristics 15/17 use an unusual inversion for non-exact fits. Heuristics 1/5/7 focus on simple inverse remaining capacity.

**Experience:**
Prioritize exact fits with a high, distinct score. For non-exact fits, use normalized slack (slack / current capacity) and map smaller slack to higher scores. Combining objectives or using scaled inverse slack offers better differentiation than simple inverse. Avoid counter-intuitive negative priority scaling.
