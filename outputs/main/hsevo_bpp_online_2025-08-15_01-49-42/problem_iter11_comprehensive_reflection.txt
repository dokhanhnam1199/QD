Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on robust differentiation and avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Objective clarity, Score differentiation, Robustness, Scalability.
*   **Advice:** Design scores that clearly distinguish between excellent fits and good-enough options. Use a hierarchical approach, prioritizing exact matches, then finely tuned slack minimization (normalized or scaled), and finally, stable secondary metrics.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on absolute slack, direct division by capacities prone to instability, and complex, unexplainable scoring interactions.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create heuristics that make decisive, understandable choices. Clear scoring ensures that the algorithm consistently favors better solutions without getting lost in minor, unstable numerical variations, promoting robustness across different problem scales.
