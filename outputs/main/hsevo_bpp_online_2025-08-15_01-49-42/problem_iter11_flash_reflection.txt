**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristics 1, 5, 6, 12, 15 (Exact Fit + Normalized Slack variants) with Heuristics 2, 4, 7 (Almost Full Fit variants) and Heuristic 3 (Hybrid V1), we see that prioritizing exact fits offers a clear, high-priority strategy. Normalized slack provides a good way to differentiate non-exact fits based on relative space utilization. The "Almost Full Fit" heuristics (like V1, which is essentially maximizing -slack) are simpler but lack the explicit handling of exact fits or the nuanced scaling of normalized slack. Heuristic 3 attempts a hybrid but its implementation is less clear than the dedicated strategies.

Comparing Heuristics 1, 5, 6, 12, 15:
- Heuristics 1, 5, 15 are very similar, prioritizing exact fits (score 1.0) and then using a scaled version of `1.0 - normalized_slack` for non-exact fits, mapping them to a range like [0.5, 0.99]. This provides a clear hierarchy and differentiated scores.
- Heuristic 6 is very similar to 1, 5, 15 but uses slightly different scaling (0.5 to 0.99).
- Heuristic 12 uses `1.0` for exact fits and `0.5 + 0.49 * (1.0 - normalized_slack)` for non-exact fits, which is functionally identical to 1, 5, 15.
- Heuristic 13 attempts to combine exact fit priority with a Best Fit strategy (minimizing normalized residual) and a tie-breaker based on initial slack. The scoring mechanism (lexicographical preference via scaling) is more complex but aims for a multi-objective optimization.
- Heuristic 14 also prioritizes exact fits and then uses a normalized remaining capacity (mapped to [0.5, 0.95]) for non-exact fits, similar to 1, 5, 6, 12, 15.

Comparing "Almost Full Fit" variants (2, 4, 7) with others:
- Heuristics 2, 4, 7 are consistent in using `-slack` (maximizing negative slack) as the primary scoring mechanism. This prioritizes bins that become most full. They assign -1 to bins that cannot fit. This is a simple and effective "Best Fit" approach but doesn't explicitly handle exact fits as a special case.

Comparing Heuristics 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 20:
- Heuristic 8 attempts to use `-log(slack + epsilon)` for differentiation, which is a novel approach for small slack values.
- Heuristics 9, 10, 11 combine slack minimization with fit ratio `item / bins_remain_cap`, weighted. This adds a second dimension to the scoring.
- Heuristic 16 tries to balance tightness with avoiding extreme fills, using `-slack` as a base and adding a penalty for very tight fits (when `slack` is below a threshold relative to `item`). This is a more sophisticated attempt to balance competing goals.
- Heuristic 17 is identical to 16.
- Heuristic 20 prioritizes exact fits with a very high score (1e6), then uses a scaled `-remaining_after_fit` (Best Fit) and a penalty based on negative initial remaining capacity as a tie-breaker. This is a strong multi-objective approach.

Heuristics 18 and 19 are incomplete code snippets.

Overall, heuristics that combine a clear, high priority for exact fits with a well-defined scoring for non-exact fits (like normalized slack or scaled best-fit) tend to perform better. Heuristics that attempt multi-objective optimization (e.g., balancing tightness with avoiding fragmentation or using tie-breakers) show promise but can become complex. The "Almost Full Fit" (-slack) is a solid baseline but can be improved by explicit exact-fit handling or more nuanced differentiation.

**Experience:**
Prioritize exact fits with a distinct high score. For non-exact fits, use scaled normalized slack or best-fit scores for differentiation. Consider simple multi-objective approaches like combining primary fit criteria with secondary tie-breakers (e.g., initial slack) for robustness, ensuring clear score hierarchies. Avoid overly complex scoring functions unless well-justified.
