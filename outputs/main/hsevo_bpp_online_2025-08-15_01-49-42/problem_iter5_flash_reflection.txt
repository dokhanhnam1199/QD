**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 ([Heuristics 1st]) and Heuristic 7 ([Heuristics 7th]), they are functionally identical, both using `1.0 / (remaining_after_fit + epsilon)` with `epsilon=1.0` in Heuristic 1 and `epsilon=0.8954438612151145` in Heuristic 7. The choice of `epsilon` is a hyperparameter.

Comparing Heuristic 2 ([Heuristics 2nd]) and Heuristic 6 ([Heuristics 6th]), they are identical implementations using `1.0 / (differences + 1.0 + 1e-9)`.

Comparing Heuristic 3 ([Heuristics 3rd]) and Heuristic 11 ([Heuristics 11th]), both aim to minimize normalized slack `remaining_capacities_if_fit / current_bin_capacities`. Heuristic 3 uses `-(remaining_capacities_if_fit) - epsilon * eligible_bins_remain_cap` while Heuristic 11 uses `1.0 - normalized_slack`. Heuristic 11's `1.0 - normalized_slack` is a clearer objective function for minimizing slack. Heuristic 3's approach of penalizing already fuller bins might be an interesting secondary objective but adds complexity.

Comparing Heuristic 9 ([Heuristics 9th]) and Heuristic 11 ([Heuristics 11th]), they are identical, both implementing `1.0 - normalized_slack` where `normalized_slack` is `remaining_capacities_if_fit / (current_bin_capacities + epsilon)`.

Comparing Heuristic 10 ([Heuristics 10th]) and Heuristic 12 ([Heuristics 12th]), they are identical, implementing an exact fit priority of 1.0 and then scaling best fit priorities to a range like [0.5, 0.9].

Comparing Heuristic 13 ([Heuristics 13th]) and Heuristic 19 ([Heuristics 19th]), they are identical. They prioritize exact fits with 1.0 and then normalize other scaled inverse priorities so the highest is 1.0.

Comparing Heuristic 14 ([Heuristics 14th]) and Heuristic 17 ([Heuristics 17th]) and Heuristic 20 ([Heuristics 20th]), they are identical. They prioritize exact fits with 1.0 and then apply `0.1 / (non_exact_bins_remaining + 1.0)` for non-exact fits.

Comparing Heuristic 5 ([Heuristics 5th]) and Heuristic 16 ([Heuristics 16th]): Heuristic 5 directly uses `-(bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item)` which is equivalent to maximizing the negative slack. Heuristic 16 uses a sigmoid function on normalized differences, which is a more complex approach to prioritize smaller differences.

Overall, heuristics that directly prioritize minimizing slack (like `1.0 - normalized_slack` or negative slack) or exact fits with a clear scoring are generally better. The use of `epsilon` or other constants for stability and scaling is important. Combinations of exact fit with best fit are common and effective.

**Experience:**
Prioritize exact fits clearly. For non-exact fits, focus on minimizing slack, preferably normalized by bin capacity. Use stable numerical methods (e.g., adding small epsilons) and consider how to scale or map scores to ensure clear differentiation between good and suboptimal choices without introducing excessive complexity.
