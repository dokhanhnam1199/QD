Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Differentiated Scores, Scaled Objective Integration, Robustness, Contextual Prioritization.
*   **Advice:** Design self-reflection to create *distinct, contextually relevant scores* for candidate solutions. Integrate multiple objectives (e.g., fit quality, resource utilization) using scaling or weighted sums that reflect their relative importance.
*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic scoring (e.g., direct inverse slack), manual prioritization that's not data-driven, and brittle numerical operations.
*   **Explanation:** This focuses on creating nuanced, comparable scores that guide the heuristic towards robust, well-reasoned choices by considering the interplay of various factors and ensuring numerical stability.
