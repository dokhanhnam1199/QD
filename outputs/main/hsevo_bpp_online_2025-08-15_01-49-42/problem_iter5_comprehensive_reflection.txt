Here's a redefinition of "Current self-reflection" to inform heuristic design, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Exact fit, slack minimization, normalized slack, stable scoring, distinct ranking.
*   **Advice:** Design scoring functions that explicitly reward exact fits, and for imperfect fits, prioritize minimizing normalized slack (slack / bin capacity) to robustly compare options across different bin sizes.
*   **Avoid:** Direct comparisons of raw slack, numerical instability from division by zero or very small capacities, and overly complex scaling that obscures underlying trade-offs.
*   **Explanation:** Clear, stable scoring ensures the heuristic reliably identifies the best available bin without getting bogged down by numerical quirks or losing interpretability, crucial for effective optimization.
