Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Objective clarity, capacity normalization, adaptive masking, robust scaling.
*   **Advice:** Focus on precisely defining objective functions (e.g., exact fit satisfaction, minimizing slack), and consistently normalize or scale capacities to create a common comparison basis. Implement dynamic masking strategies that adapt to bin characteristics rather than fixed rules.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on absolute differences or direct division. Avoid rigid, non-adaptive masking logic that fails on diverse bin sizes.
*   **Explanation:** This ensures heuristics evaluate solutions meaningfully across different scales. Adaptive masking and robust scaling prevent edge cases and numerical instability, leading to more generalizable and effective optimization.
