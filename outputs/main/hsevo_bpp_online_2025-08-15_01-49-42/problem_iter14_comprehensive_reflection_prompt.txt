{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize exact fits unequivocally. For non-exact fits, a scaled inverse normalized slack (favoring minimal residual capacity relative to original bin size) offers robust differentiation. Tunable parameters for priority ranges can improve adaptability. Avoid arbitrary penalties; focus on clear criteria.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize clear objectives: exact fit, minimal remaining capacity, or scaled differences. Normalize or scale remaining capacities to handle varying bin sizes effectively. Use clear masking for fitting bins. Avoid direct division by small numbers; use epsilon for numerical stability.\n\nPrioritize exact fits clearly. For non-exact fits, focus on minimizing slack, preferably normalized by bin capacity. Use stable numerical methods (e.g., adding small epsilons) and consider how to scale or map scores to ensure clear differentiation between good and suboptimal choices without introducing excessive complexity.\n\nPrioritize exact fits with a high, distinct score. For non-exact fits, use normalized slack (slack / current capacity) and map smaller slack to higher scores. Combining objectives or using scaled inverse slack offers better differentiation than simple inverse. Avoid counter-intuitive negative priority scaling.\n\nPrioritize exact fits with a distinct high score. For non-exact fits, use scaled normalized slack or best-fit scores for differentiation. Consider simple multi-objective approaches like combining primary fit criteria with secondary tie-breakers (e.g., initial slack) for robustness, ensuring clear score hierarchies. Avoid overly complex scoring functions unless well-justified.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
