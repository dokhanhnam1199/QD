    """
    Exact Fit with Normalized Slack Minimization priority function.

    This strategy prioritizes bins that provide an exact fit for the item.
    If no exact fit is available, it prioritizes bins that minimize the
    "normalized slack" after placing the item. Normalized slack is defined
    as (remaining_capacity - item) / original_bin_capacity. This helps
    to favor bins that have a smaller relative waste, regardless of their
    absolute remaining capacity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.
        bin_capacities: Array of original capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of priority scores for each bin. Bins that cannot accommodate the item
        receive a priority of -1. Higher scores indicate higher priority.
        Exact fits receive the highest possible score (e.g., a large positive number).
        Other fits are ranked by the negative of their normalized slack (to maximize).

    # We'll use a placeholder if bin_capacities is not passed implicitly.

    # Placeholder for original bin capacities. In a real application, this would be known.
    # Let's assume for demonstration purposes that all bins have a capacity of 1.0
    # or that this information is accessible. If not, this heuristic needs adaptation.
    # A practical approach would be to pass `bin_capacities` as an argument.
    # For this problem, we'll simulate it assuming a fixed capacity for all bins
    # to make the "normalized slack" concept work. A better design would pass it.
    
    # If `bins_remain_cap` were derived from `original_capacity - current_fill`,
    # then `original_capacity` would be available. For a standalone function,
    # we'll use a proxy: assume original capacity is related to current fill + remaining.
    # A common simplification is to assume a standard bin capacity if not explicitly given.
    # Let's assume a nominal bin capacity for the normalization.
    # A safer approach is to actually pass the original bin capacities.
    # For this exercise, we'll make a simplifying assumption:
    # If item <= 1.0, and bins_remain_cap are used, it implies bins of capacity >= 1.0.
    # Let's assume all bins have an implicit capacity of 1.0 for normalization purposes.
    # If the actual bin capacities vary and are not provided, this normalization is problematic.
    # Assuming a fixed conceptual bin capacity for normalization.
    
    # Let's try to infer a capacity if possible or use a default.
    # A more robust way is to pass `original_bin_capacities` to the function.
    # For the purpose of this example, we will assume a common bin capacity
    # if bin_capacities is not an explicit parameter.
    # If we can't assume a fixed capacity, the normalization needs careful handling.

    # A common pattern in BPP is that items are a fraction of bin capacity,
    # so if item sizes are like 0.5, 0.2, etc., bin capacity is often 1.0.
