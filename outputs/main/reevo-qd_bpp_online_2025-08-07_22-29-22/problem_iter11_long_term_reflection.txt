Prioritize exact fits (±ε tolerance); if none, pick bin with minimal slack. Score feasible bins by ‑slack, apply softmax with temperature λ = EMA(median slack). Slightly penalize opening new bins. Tie‑break by oldest bin, add tiny deterministic jitter. Keep only EMA state, ensure numeric stability.
