Score feasible bins by negative slack, apply adaptive softmax (temperature/λ) to favor tight fits. Prioritize exact‑fit, then minimal waste; add a small age penalty. Resolve ties deterministically (oldest bin) with occasional tiny random tie‑breaks. Adapt thresholds via recent size statistics or short lookahead.
