```python
def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    First‑Fit priority.

    The priority score is determined solely by the bin index – the lower the
    index of a bin that can accommodate the incoming item, the higher the
    priority. Bins that cannot hold the item receive a score of -∞ so that
    they are never selected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    item : float
        Size of the incoming item.
    bins_remain_cap : np.ndarray
        1‑D array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Priority scores; argmax picks the chosen bin.
    """
    # Identify which bins have enough capacity
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # Simple index‑based priority: 0 for bin 0, -1 for bin 1, …
    idx = np.arange(bins_remain_cap.size, dtype=float)

    # Use -∞ for bins that cannot fit to force selection among feasible bins
    priorities = np.where(can_fit, -idx, -np.inf)

    return priorities
