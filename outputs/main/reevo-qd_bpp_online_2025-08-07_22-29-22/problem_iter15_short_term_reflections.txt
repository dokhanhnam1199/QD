Scale softmax temperature by slack variance, use slack as negative logits, add tiny random tie‑breaker, zero infeasible bins.
Apply softmax with adjustable temperature, add deterministic tie‑breaking noise, and incorporate running averages for look‑ahead guidance.
Use EMA for exact fit, adaptive temperature, penalize new bins, stable softmax, minimal random tie‑breaker.
Blend slack‑based logits, adaptive noise, running‑average look‑ahead, tie‑breakers, and new‑bin penalties; tune temperature for greedy‑random balance.
Softmax with adaptive temperature; penalize fresh bins; minimal index bias; avoid per‑item global noise and stats.
Use adaptive waste penalty, softmax, exact‑fit offset, EMA of sizes, and ratio weighting for better online packing.
Prioritize exact fits, softmax negative slack, adaptive temperature, penalize new bins, deterministic tie‑breakers.
Prioritize exact fits, use exponential slack score with EMA λ, penalize fresh bins, deterministic tie‑break, tiny jitter.
Score bins by remaining slack, adapt sigmoid parameters, filter infeasible, tie‑break with tiny random jitter.
EMA slack, adaptive temperature, random jitter, penalize brand‑new bins, boost near‑mean slack, prioritize exact fits.
