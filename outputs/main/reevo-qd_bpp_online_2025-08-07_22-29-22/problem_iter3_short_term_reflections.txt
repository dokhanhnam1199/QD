Blend best‑fit scoring with controlled randomness; add deterministic tie‑breakers; incorporate lookahead; adapt thresholds to item distribution.
Prefer tight‑fit priority via slack, use softmax with temperature, balancing exploration vs exploitation, avoid pure randomness.
Exact‑fit first, then smallest leftover; deterministic scores; penalize waste; add tie‑breakers or predictive lookahead.
Score bins by negative slack, apply softmax with temperature, favor tight fits, reduce randomness, adapt temperature dynamically.Score bins by negative slack, apply softmax with temperature, favor tight fits, reduce randomness, adapt temperature dynamically.
Score bins by slack using adaptive sigmoid; avoid pure randomness; calibrate with median and range.
Combine negative slack scoring with random tie‑breaks; add age‑penalty to reduce bias.
Prioritize exact fit (zero), then minimal waste (negative leftover); -inf for infeasible; avoid randomness.
Use adaptive‑λ softmax on waste, add item‑size ratio weight, and optionally employ reinforcement learning.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; add small random tie‑breaker for equal scores.
Mask infeasible bins, prioritize smallest leftover, deterministic tie‑break, avoid randomness, consider item size distribution or lookahead.
