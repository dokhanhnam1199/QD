```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Almost Full Fit priority function.

    Picks the bin that will be *almost* full after placing the item
    (i.e. the smallest positive slack).  Bins that cannot accommodate
    the item receive a very low priority of -∞.

    Parameters
    ----------
    item : float
        Size of the item to place.
    bins_remain_cap : np.ndarray
        Remaining capacities of each bin.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Priority score for each bin; higher scores are preferred.
    """
    # Compute the remaining slack after inserting the item.
    slack = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Bins that cannot fit the item are assigned -∞ priority.
    invalid_mask = slack < 0
    priorities = np.where(invalid_mask, -np.inf, -slack)  # smaller slack ⇒ larger priority

    return priorities
