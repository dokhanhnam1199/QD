- Prioritize exact fits, then best‑fit by negative slack.  
- Tie‑break deterministically (oldest or index).  
- Skip EMA/softmax; keep scoring simple.  
- Avoid penalizing new bins.  
- Early empty‑bin check and tiny deterministic jitter help.  
- Optionally weight by item‑to‑capacity ratio or add lookahead.  
- Keep state minimal, vectorized.
