Prioritize exact fits, then best‑fit by negative slack; apply softmax with temperature ∝ slack variance; add tiny deterministic jitter for tie‑breaks; penalize opening fresh bins; use EMA of slack for adaptive temperature; weight by item‑to‑capacity ratio; early empty‑bin check; keep state minimal, vectorized.
