Score bins by negative slack; apply temperature‑controlled softmax; optionally add minuscule noise for tie‑breaking.
Blend waste‑decay softmax with controlled randomness; adapt λ per item, test temperature schedules, monitor waste variance.
Adopt adaptive logistic scoring, blend slack and item size, random tie‑breaks, tune sigmoid, and employ local search.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize leftover, randomize ties, adapt thresholds based on size distribution, apply swap improvements.
Use best‑fit scoring, scale noise by leftover spread, add look‑ahead averages, and tie‑break deterministically by bin index.
Select feasible bins, compute slack, adapt scoring via median‑based sigmoid, favor tight fits, avoid pure random selection.
Prefer minimal slack, penalize new bins, weight by fill ratio, consider item‑size distribution, avoid random tie‑breaking.
Use slack‑based scores, smooth with softmax, penalize infeasibility, and tune temperature for exploration‑exploitation balance.
Score bins by negative slack, reward tighter fits; add infinitesimal noise for tie‑breaking; avoid pure random choice.
Blend Random‑Fit with softmax, adapt λ to mean waste, weight by item size, and consider predictive models.
