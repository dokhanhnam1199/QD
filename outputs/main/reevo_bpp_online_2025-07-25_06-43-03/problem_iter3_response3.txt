def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to prioritize bins that have just enough capacity to accommodate the item.
    It favors bins with remaining capacity closest to the item size, to minimize waste and maximize bin utilization.
    Additionally, it prioritizes feasible bins with the least remaining capacity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    ratio = np.where(bins_remain_cap == 0, 0, item / bins_remain_cap)

    # Calculate the priority score for each bin, with higher scores indicating a better fit
    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, 0, 1 / (1 + diff) * ratio)
