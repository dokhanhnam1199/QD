def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function is designed to encourage the packing of items into bins 
    where the item size is close to the remaining capacity, thereby minimizing 
    waste and reducing the number of bins needed.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the waste if the item is added to each bin
    waste = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item)
    # Calculate the utilization if the item is added to each bin
    utilization = bins_remain_cap / (bins_remain_cap + item)
    # Calculate the priority score as the inverse of waste and the utilization
    priority = 1 / (1 + waste) * utilization
    return priority
