**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), the first uses simpler calculations for waste, capacity, and fit, while the 20th uses a best-fit bonus, large bin penalty, and capacity factor. The 1st includes a small boost and a large negative value for infeasible bins, while 20th normalizes priorities.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the 2nd is a more parameterized version with weights and exponent, while the 3rd version focuses on utilization and close fit, adding a penalty for almost full bins.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd version combines waste minimization, utilization, and close fit, while the 4th version uses best-fit, fullness bonus, and infeasibility handling. The 4th version uses sigmoid for bonus, while the 3rd version uses direct penalties and rewards.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), the 4th emphasizes fullness bonus and infeasibility, whereas the 5th prioritizes fill ratio and fragmentation avoidance, with penalties for nearly full bins.

Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), both are similar with the same functionality. This indicates potential redundancy or the heuristic is not improving.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first uses hardcoded weights, and the second is parameterized, suggesting the first is a simplified version.

Overall: the best heuristics tend to be simpler and more direct in their approach, while the worst are either redundant or introduce complex calculations that don't necessarily improve performance. Good heuristics balance several factors (fit, capacity, fragmentation), handle infeasible bins appropriately, and avoid overly complex calculations that add noise.

**Experience:**
Prioritize simplicity and directness when designing heuristics. Start with a core set of factors (e.g., fit, capacity) and add complexity only if demonstrably beneficial. Avoid redundancy and parameterize only when necessary for significant improvement.
