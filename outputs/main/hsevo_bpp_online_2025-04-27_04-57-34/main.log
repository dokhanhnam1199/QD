You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Initialize priorities with a base value (e.g., 0).
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Iterate through each bin and calculate its priority.
    for i, remaining_capacity in enumerate(bins_remain_cap):
        if remaining_capacity >= item:  # Can the item fit?

            # Heuristic 1: Maximize filled space. A bin closer to being full after placement gets higher priority.
            fill_ratio = item / remaining_capacity
            priorities[i] += fill_ratio

            # Heuristic 2: Minimize wasted space (if item fits perfectly).
            if remaining_capacity - item < 1e-6: # consider very small difference as equals
                priorities[i] += 1.0  # Boost priority if item fits perfectly
            else:
                 # Heuristic 3: Avoid Fragmentation.
                 priorities[i] +=  1.0 / (remaining_capacity-item)


        else:
            priorities[i] = -np.inf  # Very low priority if item doesn't fit.

    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Inspired by the dance of planets! We favour bins where the item fits comfortably (like Venus nestled near the Sun), but also consider bins nearing fullness (like Jupiter pulling objects into its orbit).

        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:

    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    
    # First, consider only bins that can accommodate the item. Ignore those that cannot.
    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    if not np.any(feasible_bins):
        # No suitable bin exists. Return very low priorities. This will likely result in opening a new bin.
        return priorities

    #Calculate emptiness - bigger values mean less space
    emptiness = 1 - (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap))

    # A measure of 'fit'. Smaller ratios are better (item fits comfortably).
    fit_ratios = item / bins_remain_cap

    # Increase reward of filling up space of the bin
    scaled_emptiness = 1 / (1 + emptiness)

    # Final score with two combined bonuses
    priorities = feasible_bins * (scaled_fit + scaled_emptiness)

    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of fill ratio, perfect fit, and fragmentation avoidance, while the worst only considers fill ratio and perfect fit. (2nd best) vs (second worst), the heuristic emphasizes waste minimization and remaining capacity scaling, whereas its counterpart focuses solely on space usage and original fullness. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best heuristic explicitly calculates priorities for each bin using a for loop to apply conditions, while the second best leverages numpy vectorization for eligible bins and waste calculation. (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic incorporates bin utilization and close fit bonuses, while the fourth focuses on fill ratio and tightness, with a penalty for near-full bins. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical copies. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors (waste, utilization, fragmentation) and use numpy efficiently. They often include bonuses/penalties to fine-tune the selection process and avoid extremes (overfilling, leaving large gaps).
- 
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, actively avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, multi-objective, computational cost, edge-case mitigation.

*   **Advice:** Structure self-reflection around iterative refinement. Evaluate computational cost and trade-offs when combining factors. Design penalties/bonuses based on *data-driven* edge-case analysis, not intuition alone.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting computational cost analysis during iterative stages.

*   **Explanation:** Refine heuristics iteratively by tracking performance metrics (e.g., solution quality, runtime). A good approach involves a tight feedback loop: (1) design, (2) implement, (3) test, (4) analyze, (5) refine.


Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Utilizes a combination of factors, inspired by gravitational attraction and
    the principle of minimizing wasted space. Higher remaining capacity with closer
    size to the item results in higher priority, encouraging efficient packing.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Ensure bins_remain_cap is a numpy array to handle potential errors
    bins_remain_cap = np.array(bins_remain_cap)

    # Avoid division by zero and negative values inside log
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)  # Initialize all priorities to 0

    if np.any(valid_bins): # only compute priority if at least one bin is non-empty
        valid_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]

        # Proximity factor: smaller difference between item and bin capacity is better
        proximity = np.exp(-np.abs(valid_remain_cap - item) / item)

        # Capacity factor: higher remaining capacity is generally better, but penalize bins that are too large compared to the item
        capacity = valid_remain_cap / np.max(valid_remain_cap)
        capacity_penalty = np.where(valid_remain_cap > 2 * item, 0.5, 1) # slightly penalize bins where capacity is way larger than the item

        # Combine factors to produce priority
        priorities[valid_bins] = proximity * capacity * capacity_penalty
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, actively avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, multi-objective, computational cost, edge-case mitigation.

*   **Advice:** Structure self-reflection around iterative refinement. Evaluate computational cost and trade-offs when combining factors. Design penalties/bonuses based on *data-driven* edge-case analysis, not intuition alone.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting computational cost analysis during iterative stages.

*   **Explanation:** Refine heuristics iteratively by tracking performance metrics (e.g., solution quality, runtime). A good approach involves a tight feedback loop: (1) design, (2) implement, (3) test, (4) analyze, (5) refine.


Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!
