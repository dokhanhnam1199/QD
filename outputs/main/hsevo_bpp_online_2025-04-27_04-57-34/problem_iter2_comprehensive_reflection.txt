
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, actively avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, multi-objective, computational cost, edge-case mitigation.

*   **Advice:** Structure self-reflection around iterative refinement. Evaluate computational cost and trade-offs when combining factors. Design penalties/bonuses based on *data-driven* edge-case analysis, not intuition alone.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting computational cost analysis during iterative stages.

*   **Explanation:** Refine heuristics iteratively by tracking performance metrics (e.g., solution quality, runtime). A good approach involves a tight feedback loop: (1) design, (2) implement, (3) test, (4) analyze, (5) refine.
