
Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design, steering clear of the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a revised perspective:

*   **Keywords:** Parsimony, Evidence-based, Core Factors, Adaptive Complexity.
*   **Advice:** Begin with a minimal viable heuristic, focusing on essential factors. Rigorously test and validate each added layer of complexity based on performance gains.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, complex scoring functions without justification, and parameter proliferation without empirical evidence.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize creating a simple, understandable baseline. Only introduce complexity or parameterization if it demonstrably and significantly improves performance, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead. Focus on *why* additional factors are needed.
