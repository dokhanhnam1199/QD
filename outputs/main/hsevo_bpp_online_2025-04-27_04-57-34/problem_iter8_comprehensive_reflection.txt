
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, learning from what *not* to do.

*   **Keywords:** Factor interaction, scaling, edge case handling, parameter tuning, problem instance adaptation.
*   **Advice:** Systematically explore factor combinations, use non-linear scaling, build specific edge case responses, and design parameters for instance-specific optimization.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization (vectorization), overly complex penalty/bonus systems, unnecessary parameters, and redundancy.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on fundamental design principles first: understanding interactions, handling extreme situations, and allowing focused adaptation. Avoid performance tuning or added complexity until the basic heuristic is sound.
