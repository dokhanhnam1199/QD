**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of fill ratio, perfect fit, and fragmentation avoidance, while the worst only considers fill ratio and perfect fit. (2nd best) vs (second worst), the heuristic emphasizes waste minimization and remaining capacity scaling, whereas its counterpart focuses solely on space usage and original fullness. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best heuristic explicitly calculates priorities for each bin using a for loop to apply conditions, while the second best leverages numpy vectorization for eligible bins and waste calculation. (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic incorporates bin utilization and close fit bonuses, while the fourth focuses on fill ratio and tightness, with a penalty for near-full bins. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical copies. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors (waste, utilization, fragmentation) and use numpy efficiently. They often include bonuses/penalties to fine-tune the selection process and avoid extremes (overfilling, leaving large gaps).

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors to create a more nuanced priority score. Efficient use of vectorization is crucial for performance. Penalties and bonuses can help avoid edge cases and fine-tune the heuristic's behavior to reduce number of bins used.
