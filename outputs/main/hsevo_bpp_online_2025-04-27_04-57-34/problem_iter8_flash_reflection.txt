**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first heuristic includes a small boost for tie-breaking while the second does not. The first one also penalizes infeasible bins heavily with a large negative value, ensuring they are truly avoided. The second heuristic uses `1e-9` to avoid division by zero, which might not be a strong enough penalty.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the second heuristic directly calculates waste and uses `1.0 / (waste + 1e-9)` for prioritization, while the third heuristic uses an exponential function based on remaining capacity and utilization. The second heuristic uses a simple linear utilization factor, whereas the third uses a normalized utilization combined with an exponential fit priority. The third also explicitly checks for feasibility and returns early if no bins are feasible.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic prioritizes based on tightness of fit and bin utilization, while the fourth prioritizes based on waste, utilization, and close fit. They are very similar; the third checks feasibility early and the utilization factor is simpler. However, the fourth uses `1.0 / (waste + 1e-9)` similar to the second.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are duplicates.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), the seventh one has parameters that can be tuned.

Overall: The better heuristics tend to balance multiple factors (waste, utilization, best-fit) with carefully chosen functions (exponential, scaling). Explicitly handling infeasible bins with very large negative priorities is crucial. The use of tunable parameters is also a positive feature. A good balance avoids being too greedy and avoids fragmentation. Normalization of capacity is also helpful.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, using appropriate scaling or functions (e.g., exponential) to balance their influence. Explicitly handle edge cases (e.g., infeasible solutions) and consider adding tunable parameters to adapt to different problem instances.
