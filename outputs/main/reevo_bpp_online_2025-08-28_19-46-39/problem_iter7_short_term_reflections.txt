Prioritize tighter fits (smaller differences) & simpler scaling; avoid unnecessary inversions/means. Explore strategically.




Prioritize best-fit, then explore randomly (epsilon-greedy) to avoid premature convergence & improve robustness.




Prioritize tightest fit, normalize scores (sigmoid), and use epsilon-greedy for exploration & diversification. 




Prioritize exploitation (best-fit) & balanced exploration; consider bin density & item size.
Prioritize simplicity & feasibility. Explore exploitation-exploration trade-offs; avoid overly complex scoring.
Favor simplicity & exploitation (best fit); add controlled exploration (epsilon-greedy) for robustness.
Prioritize fit, add small random noise, and simplify—avoid complex scaling like sigmoid.
Focus on exploiting good fits, balanced with controlled exploration (e.g., epsilon-greedy) for robustness.
Prioritize tighter fits, use exploration (epsilon-greedy), and simplify scoring functions—avoid over-engineering.




Prioritize best fit, then explore randomly (epsilon-greedy) to avoid getting stuck locally.
