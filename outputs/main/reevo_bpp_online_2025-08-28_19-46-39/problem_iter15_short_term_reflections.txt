Prioritize exponentiated fit, decay exploration, and scale random boosts—subtle changes yield significant BPP performance gains.
Prioritize negative fit, smaller exploration boosts, and carefully tune exploration rate (epsilon) for balance.




Prioritize simpler scaling, decaying exploration, and small random boosts for better, robust performance.
Decaying exploration & simpler priority functions (avoiding arbitrary scaling) often yield better online BPP performance.
Prioritize tightest fit, decay exploration, and scale randomness appropriately—avoid normalization issues.
Focus on balancing exploitation (tightest fit) with controlled, smaller-scale exploration boosts. Avoid excessive randomness.
Prioritize tighter fits (smaller remainders) & use smooth, scaled priority values—avoid hard 0/1 assignments. Explore strategically.
Prioritize tighter fits (exponential scaling), and balance exploration—randomization improves performance, but judiciously.




Prioritize tighter fits (smaller remainders) & use smooth, scaled priorities—avoid hard 0/1 values. Explore strategically!




Prioritize tighter fits, tune exploration (decaying epsilon), and scale randomness carefully.
