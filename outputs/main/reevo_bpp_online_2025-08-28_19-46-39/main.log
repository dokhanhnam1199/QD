Your task is to write a priority function using the Sigmoid Fit Score strategy for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[2025-08-28 19:52:25,039][root][INFO] - Long-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Introduce randomness; consider item density & bin utilization beyond just remaining capacity. Explore hybrid approaches!
Prioritize remaining capacity, add small randomness, and avoid overly simplistic or purely greedy approaches.
Prioritize fit *and* randomness; avoid deterministic choices; consider remaining capacity directly.
Exploit bin emptiness & remaining capacity; randomness can surprisingly outperform simple worst-fit approaches.
Prioritize fit *and* avoid fragmentation; sigmoid scaling & penalties are key for nuanced bin selection.
Prioritize bins nearing item size; avoid division by zero; consider negative scores for impossible fits.
Prioritize bins based on *fit*, not just remaining capacity; consider a smooth, scaled fitness score.




Prioritize fit *and* explore bin diversity—randomness & remaining capacity matter! Avoid premature full bins.




Prioritize fit *and* consider bin utilization; avoid uniform/zero priorities. Explore inverse relationships for better packing.




Prioritize bins based on *how well* items fit, not just remaining capacity; sigmoid scaling helps!

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
## BPP Heuristic Design: Constructive Hints

**Focus on *fit* first, not just remaining capacity.** Use sigmoid scaling for nuanced bin selection & avoid deterministic choices with added randomness. Exploit bin emptiness, prioritize near-size bins, and penalize impossible fits to minimize fragmentation.





[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Epsilon-Greedy.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        epsilon: Exploration rate.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    # Calculate the 'greedy' priority (best fit)
    eligible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.any(eligible_bins):
        best_fit_bin_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[eligible_bins] - item)
        best_fit_bin_index = np.where(eligible_bins)[0][best_fit_bin_index]
        priorities[best_fit_bin_index] = 1.0

    # Epsilon-greedy exploration
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        # Assign a random priority to eligible bins
        eligible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
        if np.any(eligible_bins):
            random_bin_indices = np.where(eligible_bins)[0]
            random_index = np.random.choice(random_bin_indices)
            priorities[random_index] = np.random.rand()
    
    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
