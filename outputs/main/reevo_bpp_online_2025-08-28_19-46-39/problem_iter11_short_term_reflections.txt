Focus on fit, consistently scale priorities, and judiciously apply exploration—avoid redundant randomization.




Simpler, direct scoring often wins. Randomness should *perturb*, not dominate, priority signals.

Focus on exploiting best fits, then explore *other* options, not all, randomly.
Prioritize tighter fits with scaling (e.g., exponential) & tune exploration rates carefully.
Transform fit scores non-linearly; explore strategically, avoiding uniform randomness; consider bin rank/age.




Prioritize tighter fits (negative fit scores), and tune exploration (epsilon) carefully for balance.




Prioritize direct fitness (smaller remainder) & simpler exploration—avoid unnecessary exponentiation/perturbations.
Prioritize exploitation (best fit) & tune exploration (epsilon); avoid excessive randomness/scaling.
Focus exploration *only* on eligible bins; avoid perturbing irrelevant bins for efficiency.
Prioritize tighter fits (negative fit scores), tune exploration (epsilon), and avoid redundant randomness.
