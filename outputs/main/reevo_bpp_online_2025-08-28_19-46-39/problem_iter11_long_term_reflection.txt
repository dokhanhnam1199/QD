## BPP Heuristic Design: Constructive Hints

**Exploit best-fit first.** Score bins with *exponentially scaled remainders* (prioritize tighter fits). **Perturb bin selection *slightly* with targeted randomness** â€“ explore only eligible bins. **Keep scoring simple & tune exploration (epsilon) carefully.** Avoid over-scaling/normalization.
