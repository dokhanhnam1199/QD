Prioritize tighter fits (smaller remainders) with exponential scaling; balance exploration via epsilon-greedy randomness.
Prioritize tighter fits (smaller remainders) & balance exploration with exploitation (epsilon-greedy). Consider scaling/normalization.




Scale fit scores (e.g., exponentially) & refine exploration; avoid direct remainder use.
Prioritize exploitation (best fit) & use a *small*, decaying epsilon for exploration.
Prioritize tighter fits (smaller remainders) with exponential scaling; balance with targeted exploration (epsilon-greedy).




Prioritize direct reward (smaller remainder) & tune exploration carefully; avoid unnecessary exponentiation.




Prioritize scaling fit scores (e.g., exponential) & tune exploration rate (`epsilon`) for better performance.




Prioritize tighter fits non-linearly; explore strategically with randomized, not perturbed, priorities.
Prioritize tighter fits (smaller remainders) & explore randomly, but avoid overly boosting specific bins.
Focus on fit, then exploreâ€”consistent randomization improves performance; avoid unnecessary conditional logic.
