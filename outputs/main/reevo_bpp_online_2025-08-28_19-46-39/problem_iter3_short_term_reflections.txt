Introduce randomness; consider item density & bin utilization beyond just remaining capacity. Explore hybrid approaches!
Prioritize remaining capacity, add small randomness, and avoid overly simplistic or purely greedy approaches.
Prioritize fit *and* randomness; avoid deterministic choices; consider remaining capacity directly.
Exploit bin emptiness & remaining capacity; randomness can surprisingly outperform simple worst-fit approaches.
Prioritize fit *and* avoid fragmentation; sigmoid scaling & penalties are key for nuanced bin selection.
Prioritize bins nearing item size; avoid division by zero; consider negative scores for impossible fits.
Prioritize bins based on *fit*, not just remaining capacity; consider a smooth, scaled fitness score.




Prioritize fit *and* explore bin diversityâ€”randomness & remaining capacity matter! Avoid premature full bins.




Prioritize fit *and* consider bin utilization; avoid uniform/zero priorities. Explore inverse relationships for better packing.




Prioritize bins based on *how well* items fit, not just remaining capacity; sigmoid scaling helps!
