Prioritize exploitation (tightest fit), modulate exploration’s impact—avoid small, consistent boosts. Randomness should *sometimes* dominate.
Prioritize exploitation (tightest fit), then bolder, less frequent exploration for improved BPP heuristics.
Reduce exploration rate & scale random boosts; tighter fits consistently outperform random choices.
Tune exploration strength; consider bin count/item size ratios; prioritize consistently tight fits.




Dynamically adjust exploration (epsilon decay) & randomness scale; prioritize tighter fits consistently.
Dynamically adjust exploration; scale random boosts based on remaining bin capacity. Consider bin count.
Tune exploration rate (epsilon) & randomness scale; prioritize tighter fits via exponential scaling.
Prioritize tighter fits exponentially; tune exploration (epsilon) carefully; avoid small, fixed random boosts.
Prioritize tightest fit, balance exploration (epsilon-greedy) & adaptive randomness—avoid fixed scales.
Increase exploration rate (epsilon) & random boost magnitude—balance exploitation & discovery effectively.
