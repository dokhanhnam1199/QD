Scale exploration by item size & bin fullness; prioritize tighter fits exponentially. Tune exploration rate!
Lower exploration rates & scaled randomness often improve performance; prioritize tighter fits exponentially.
Decaying exploration & scaled randomness are key; tighten fit prioritization consistently improves BPP performance.
Lower, decaying exploration rates & tighter fit prioritization consistently outperform aggressive, scaled randomness. 




Normalize scores, tune exploration strength dynamically, and consider bin fullness explicitly.
Scale exploration with bin capacity; prioritize boosting smaller, eligible bins for better performance.
Scale exploration to bin capacity; avoid boosting ineligible bins—balance exploitation & exploration.




Prioritize tighter fits (exponential scaling). Dynamically adjust exploration (decaying epsilon & randomness scale) for balance.
Prioritize tightest fit, tune exploration (epsilon), and control random boost magnitude—avoid scaling to item size.
Focus on simpler fit functions & adaptive exploration rates; avoid unnecessary normalization/scaling.
