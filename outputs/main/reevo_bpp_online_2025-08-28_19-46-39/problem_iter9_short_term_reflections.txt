Scale fit scores non-linearly (e.g., exponential) to amplify tight-fit preference; explore strategically.
Focus on simplicity & tightest fit first; controlled exploration boosts performance. Avoid unnecessary density calculations.
Prioritize tighter fits directly; focused epsilon-greedy on *one* bin boosts exploration effectiveness.
Prioritize simpler, direct scores (remainder) & strategically add exploration noise—avoid complex normalization.
Prioritize tighter fits, balance exploration (randomness), and consider bin utilization beyond just remaining capacity.




Prioritize simplicity & exploit bin-specific best-fit; avoid unnecessary normalization/scaling. Exploration helps, but focus greedy selection.




Scale fit scores non-linearly (e.g., exponential) to amplify subtle differences & guide bin selection.
Scale fit scores—exponentials amplify subtle differences, improving prioritization & performance. Exploration is key!
Small, *scaled* random perturbations for exploration are key; avoid full random priority resets.
Focus on bin density, best-fit, and targeted exploration—avoid uniform randomization.
