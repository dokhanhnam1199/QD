Dynamically tune exploration (epsilon) based on *item size* & scale boosts by *bin capacity*.
Scale exploration adaptively with bin utilization; fixed rates can hinder performance. Prioritize tightest fit strongly.




Scaling exploration by bin capacity & adjusting epsilon significantly impacts performance; prioritize tightest fit, balance exploration.
Scale exploration by bin capacity; adapt exploration rate (epsilon) dynamically for improved performance.




Increase exploration (epsilon) cautiously, avoid division by zero, and prioritize tighter fits exponentially.
Reduce exploration rate & scale randomness by remaining capacity; favor tighter fits.
Increase exploration rate (epsilon) & tune scaling; prioritize tightest fit consistently.
Scale exploration dynamically with bin capacity; adjust epsilon and scaling factors for performance.
Fixed exploration rates often outperform dynamic ones; scale randomness by bin capacity.
Dynamically adjust exploration (epsilon) based on item size & bin fullness for improved performance.
