Prioritize exploitation (best fit) but balance with controlled exploration (epsilon-greedy) for robust online BPP heuristics.
Prioritize fit, penalize fragmentation, and tune sigmoid shape for optimal exploration/exploitation balance.
Prioritize tight fits, encourage diversity, and add small randomness for exploration—avoid premature convergence.




Prioritize fit *and* avoid fragmentation; sigmoid scaling/shifting tunes aggressiveness, penalizing near-full bins.
Prioritize eligibility, emptiness, fit, and near-size; combine scores & add exploration (noise).
Prioritize fit *and* utilization, consider non-linear scoring (sigmoid), and penalize near-full/unfitting bins.
Emphasize tightest fit, explore via randomness, and tune randomness magnitude carefully.
Prioritize fit, encourage diversity, and add small randomness for exploration—avoid premature convergence.
Favor simple, capacity-driven prioritization with slight randomization for exploration—avoid complex, unstable fits.
Prioritize simplicity & exploration; best-fit first, then introduce controlled randomness (epsilon-greedy).
