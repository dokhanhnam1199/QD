Prioritize tighter fits exponentially; controlled, random exploration (epsilon-greedy) prevents premature convergence. Tune epsilon!
Prioritize tightest fit, but balance exploration (epsilon-greedy) – decay exploration over time.
Simpler scaling (direct exponentiation) often works better; avoid unnecessary normalization/constants. Explore strategically!
Prioritize tightest fit, use decaying randomness (epsilon-greedy), and tune exploration scale carefully.
Prioritize tightest fit, but balance exploration via adaptive randomness—decaying epsilon or scaled boosts.
Decaying epsilon & exploiting tightest fit consistently yields better online bin packing performance.
Reduce exploration randomness; smaller boosts & focused exploration yield better bin packing performance.
Prioritize tightest fit, but balance exploration—consider adaptive epsilon or weighted randomization schemes.
Prioritize tightest fit, balance exploration (epsilon-greedy) & avoid excessive randomness—small boosts help.
Prioritize tighter fits, tune exploration (epsilon), and consider scaling/randomization strategies carefully.
