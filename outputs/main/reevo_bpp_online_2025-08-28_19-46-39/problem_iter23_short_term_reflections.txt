Dynamically adjust exploration; prioritize bins, scale randomness, and avoid zero-division issues.
Prioritize simplicity & dynamic randomness scaling; avoid complex fullness calculations & normalization. Explore bin capacity directly.
Scale randomness by bin capacity; avoid uniform exploration & boost eligible bins.
Normalize fitness scores by item size; scale exploration randomness carefully for better performance.
Dynamic, scaled exploration—focusing randomness on viable bins—and simpler priority functions often outperform complex, static ones.
Prioritize tightest fit, balanced with controlled, small-scale random exploration for escaping local optima.




Simpler exploration (scaled randomness) often outperforms complex, dynamic schemes. Prioritize fit; avoid excessive normalization.
Prioritize tightest fit, tune exploration rates adaptively, and control random boost magnitude carefully.
Tune exploration via item/bin characteristics; decaying randomness & scaling boost improves performance.
Dynamically adjust exploration; scale randomness to bin capacity; prioritize tighter fits directly.
