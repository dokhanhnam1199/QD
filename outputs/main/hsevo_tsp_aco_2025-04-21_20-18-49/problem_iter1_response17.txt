    Heuristics for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) based on a combination of
    inverse distance, node degree, and a simulated annealing-inspired exploration.
    This is analogous to path integrals by considering possible trajectories.

        A numpy ndarray of the same shape as distance_matrix, representing
        prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution.
