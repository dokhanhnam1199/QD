**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (8th), we see that the first one uses default values for `attractiveness_exponent` and `sparsification_factor`, while the second one hardcodes these values. The first one is more flexible.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th), we see that both are exactly the same.

Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the 6th introduces more parameters (`inverse_distance_offset`, `node_attractiveness_scaling`, `node_centrality_scaling`, `temperature_scaling`) that control the heuristic calculation, offering finer-grained control. The 6th also imports `random`, `math`, `scipy`, and `torch` which are not used, indicating potential future extensions or debugging artifacts.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), we see that both are exactly the same.

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the first uses node centrality penalty, while the second one does not.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), we see that both are exactly the same.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), (15th) vs (14th), the 15th normalizes the combined heuristic matrix before sparsification, leading to a more robust and stable performance, and the 14th use different weights for `inverse_distance`, `gravitational_attraction` and `randomness`.

Overall: The better heuristics introduce more parameters for fine-grained control, incorporate centrality penalties, and normalize heuristics matrix for stable performance. They also focus on adaptive sparsification.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize flexibility by using parameters, consider normalization for stable performance, and explore adaptive sparsification techniques to focus on promising solutions. Also, remove unused libraries.
