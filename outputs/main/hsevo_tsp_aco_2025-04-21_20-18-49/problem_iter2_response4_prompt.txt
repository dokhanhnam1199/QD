Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following \"heuristics\". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    A more sophisticated heuristics function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n\n    This version combines several ideas inspired by physics and common-sense heuristics\n    to provide more informative edge priors.  It aims to balance exploration\n    (allowing for non-obvious edges) with exploitation (favoring short, promising edges).\n\n    Specifically, it uses:\n    1.  Inverse distance: Shorter edges are generally more desirable.\n    2.  Node degree desirability: Nodes with fewer short connections are made more desirable\n        as endpoints of edges.  This encourages exploring parts of the graph that\n        are less well-connected initially. This simulates a sort of 'attractive force'.\n    3.  Distance normalization: The 'temperature' variable adjusts how strongly we adhere to\n        short distances. At higher temperatures, we're more willing to explore longer edges.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): The distance matrix representing the distances\n                                         between cities.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A matrix of the same shape as distance_matrix, representing the\n                     prior probabilities of including each edge in a solution.

Inverse Distance:  Nodes closer together are naturally more promising.\n\n    2.  Gravity-Inspired Attraction:  Nodes exert a \"gravitational\" pull\n        proportional to the inverse square of their distance, enhancing\n        the attraction of closer nodes.  We use inverse-square for the \"attractive force\", but avoid 0 division.\n\n    3.

The key difference lies in how node degree is used and the exploration strategy; the best uses \"attractiveness\" to less-connected nodes, while the worst uses a simpler inverse degree and a more direct random addition.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the second best heuristic uses inverse distance, rank-based normalization, and radioactive decay analogy (edge half-life), and then normalizes the heuristic matrix between 0 and 1; The second worst heuristic combines inverse distance with node degree and randomness with a weight. Key difference here is rank-based normalization that emphasize relative edge importance, independent of scale and the decay factor.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first heuristic focuses on a temperature-controlled balance between exploitation and exploration, normalizing node attractiveness to drive towards isolated nodes, while the second employs rank-based normalization and a radioactive decay analogy to favor shorter edges probabilistically. The first heuristic is more grounded in a simulated physical process, while the second adopts concepts from radioactivity.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic uses inverse distance, nearest neighbor influence, avoidance of long edges, and start/end point bias; the fourth uses inverse distance, gravity-inspired attraction, global connectivity boost, and local optimization influence (row and column means). The third favors nearest neighbors explicitly and penalizes long edges aggressively, while the fourth balances inverse distance with gravitational attraction and local optimization metrics, adding a constant boost to all edges.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), the 19th and 20th are identical. They use inverse distance, node degree heuristic (favor nodes with fewer connections), and simulated annealing-inspired exploration, and then normalizing.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors, including inverse distance, node degree information, and some form of exploration strategy (temperature, randomness, rank-based normalization, radioactive decay). They often normalize the heuristic matrix to a specific range. The use of more sophisticated metaphors and analogies (radioactive decay, gravity) appears correlated with better performance. Emphasizing relative edge importance independent of scales might be more useful. Adding some kind of exploration strategy is vital for escaping local optima.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, here's a refined concept of \"Current Self-Reflection\" aimed at improving heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative Improvement, Performance Analysis, Adaptability, Bias Mitigation.\n*   **Advice:** Critically analyze heuristic performance across diverse problem instances.
