- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a refined concept of "Current Self-Reflection" aimed at improving heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative Improvement, Performance Analysis, Adaptability, Bias Mitigation.
*   **Advice:** Critically analyze heuristic performance across diverse problem instances. Identify strengths and weaknesses. Quantify the impact of individual components.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on intuition or anecdotal evidence. Neglecting edge cases or focusing solely on average performance. Premature optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Effective reflection involves data-driven analysis, constant questioning of assumptions, and a commitment to refining heuristics based on empirical results. Focus on adaptability and identifying biases.
