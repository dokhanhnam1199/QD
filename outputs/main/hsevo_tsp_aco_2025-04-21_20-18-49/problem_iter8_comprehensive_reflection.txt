- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I understand. Here's a redefined "Current self-reflection" aimed at designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection," and focusing on actionable insights:

*   **Keywords:** Parameterization, Normalization, Adaptive Sparsification, Dynamic thresholds, Modular design.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with tunable parameters and dynamic thresholds for robustness. Implement normalization techniques to mitigate scale issues when combining diverse factors. Explore adaptive sparsification for efficient solution space exploration by focusing computational effort.

*   **Avoid:** Hardcoding constants and over-reliance on single analogies. Neglecting validation of components regardless of inspiration.

*   **Explanation:** Parameterization allows fine-tuning, normalization ensures fair comparison, and adaptive sparsification focuses search. Dynamic thresholds provide robustness. Modular design promotes flexibility.
