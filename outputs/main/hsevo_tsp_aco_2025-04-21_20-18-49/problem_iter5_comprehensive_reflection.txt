- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to provide more actionable advice for designing better heuristics, while avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Parameterization, Normalization, Dynamic Adaptation, Factor Combination.

*   **Advice:** Focus on creating modular heuristic components with adjustable parameters. Normalize inputs to allow fair comparisons. Design mechanisms that dynamically adapt to problem characteristics during runtime.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly combining factors without understanding their interactions. Over-reliance on single, static threshold values.

*   **Explanation:** Robust heuristics result from carefully integrating adaptable components. Parameterization facilitates tuning and generalization. Dynamic adaptation allows the heuristic to respond to the problem's nuances. Normalization ensures fair evaluation of different factors.
