{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize flexibility by using parameters, consider normalization for stable performance, and explore adaptive sparsification techniques to focus on promising solutions. Also, remove unused libraries.\nAdaptive parameters and dynamic thresholds are important for creating robust heuristics. Combining diverse factors and normalizing results generally improves performance. Avoid hardcoding constants where possible, and allow for flexibility through parameters.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nFor designing better heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing values to a consistent scale, and incorporating a well-controlled exploration strategy. Sophisticated analogies can inspire useful components, but validation is essential. Always consider relative importance of edges independently of scales.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
