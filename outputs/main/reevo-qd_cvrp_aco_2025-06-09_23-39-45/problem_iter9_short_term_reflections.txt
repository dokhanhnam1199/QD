Savings, demand considerations, normalization, sparsification, and depot prioritization improve the heuristic.

The better code uses a simpler, more direct combination of savings, demand, and distance, with a global threshold.

Incorporate savings, demand, and distance. Normalize factors and sparsify the heuristic matrix, biasing depot connections.

Consider multiplicative combination, harmonic mean for demand, and thresholding on positive heuristic values.

Geometric mean in demand factor, explicit distance normalization, and increased sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Harmonic mean for demand, normalized distance, and multiplicative combination improve edge selection. Adjust sparsification percentile.

Savings, demand considerations, and distance normalization improve edge selection compared to raw distance.

The better heuristic combines savings, demand, and distance, then sparsifies and biases depot connections.

The better heuristic combines savings, demand, and distance, sparsifies, and biases depot connections. Normalization is crucial.

Consider multiplicative combination, harmonic mean for demand, and sparsity based on positive values.
