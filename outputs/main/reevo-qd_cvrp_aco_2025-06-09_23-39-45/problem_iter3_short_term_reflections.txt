Consider savings, demand, and distance. Normalize and combine them, then sparsify and boost depot connections.

Incorporate savings, demand, and distance. Normalize factors, sparsify, and prioritize depot connections.

Better heuristics incorporate savings, demand, distance normalization, sparsification, and depot prioritization.

Incorporate savings, demand, and distance. Sparsify the matrix and prioritize depot connections for better heuristics.

Consider savings, demand, sparsification, and depot connections. Normalize and combine factors effectively.

The better heuristic incorporates savings, demand, and sparsification, prioritizing depot connections to guide search.

Savings, demand, and distance normalization improve edge selection. Sparsity and depot prioritization also help.

The better heuristic combines savings, demand, and distance, then sparsifies and biases depot connections.

The better heuristic considers savings, demand, and distance, using normalization and sparsification for improved edge selection.

Consider savings, demand, distance normalization, sparsification, and depot connection weighting for improved heuristics.
