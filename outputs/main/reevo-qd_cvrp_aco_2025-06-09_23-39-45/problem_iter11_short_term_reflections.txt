Savings, demand consideration, normalization, sparsification, and depot prioritization improve edge selection for CVRP.

Better heuristics use multiplicative combination, harmonic mean for demand, and capacity consideration.

Harmonic mean for demand, normalized distance, multiplicative combination, and adjusted sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Harmonic mean for demand, capacity consideration, and distance prioritization improve heuristic quality.

Harmonic mean for demand, normalized distance, multiplicative combination, and sparsification percentile adjustment improve heuristic quality.

The better code uses harmonic mean for demand, adjusts sparsification, adds capacity considerations, and prioritizes shorter distances.

Prioritize distance, use harmonic mean for demand, combine factors multiplicatively, and add capacity consideration.

Savings, demand, distance, and capacity considerations are key. Normalization and sparsity improve exploration.

Prioritize distance more, explicitly consider capacity, and reward routes with lower combined demand.

Demand factor: Geometric mean divided by sum is better. Multiplicative combination and aggressive sparsification works better.
