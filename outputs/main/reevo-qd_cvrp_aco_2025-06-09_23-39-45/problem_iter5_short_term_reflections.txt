Careful weighting, distance normalization, and adjusted sparsification improve heuristic performance.

The better heuristic incorporates savings, demand, and sparsification for improved edge selection.

Savings, demand considerations, normalization, sparsification, and depot prioritization improve heuristic performance.

Incorporate problem-specific knowledge (savings, demand) and normalize values. Sparsify to encourage exploration and bias toward the depot.

1. Normalize distance, weight factors, and tune percentile threshold.
2. Experiment with different weighting and normalization schemes.

Consider savings, demand, sparsification, and depot prioritization for enhanced heuristic design.

Prioritize weighting factors, normalize distances, and adjust sparsification percentile for better exploration.

Prioritize distance normalization and weighted combinations. Adjust sparsity threshold for better exploration.

Incorporate savings, demand, and sparsification. Prioritize depot connections. Normalize to avoid bias from scale.

Savings, demand consideration, normalization, sparsification, and depot prioritization improve edge selection significantly.
