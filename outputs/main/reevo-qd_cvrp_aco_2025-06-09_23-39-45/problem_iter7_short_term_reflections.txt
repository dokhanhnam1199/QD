Incorporate savings, demand, and distance. Sparsify the matrix. Prioritize connections to the depot.

Consider savings, demand, distance, normalization, sparsification, and depot biasing for improved edge selection.

Prioritize normalized factors (savings, demand, distance) via multiplication. Tune sparsity threshold and depot connection weights.

Demand calculation, distance normalization, combination strategy, and sparsification notably impact heuristic performance.

Geometric mean demand factor hurts. Multiplicative combination and a global sparsification threshold helps.

Consider savings, demand, distance, normalization, sparsification, and depot connection biasing for improvement.

Geometric mean in demand factor is less effective than the sum. Combining factors via division improved performance.

The better code uses a different demand factor, combines factors via division, and applies sparsification more effectively.

Multiplicative combination, direct distance consideration, and adjusted depot biasing improve heuristic quality.

Consider savings, demand, distance jointly. Sparsity and depot prioritization are beneficial.
