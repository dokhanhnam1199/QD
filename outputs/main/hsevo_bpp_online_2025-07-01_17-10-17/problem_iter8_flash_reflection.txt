**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that both prioritize waste minimization and target fill. However, the 1st uses `half_full_priority` which is a more nuanced approach to targeting a half-full state, while the 20th calculates `fill_priority` towards 75% full. The 1st directly calculates the distance to half-full *after* placing the item.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the 2nd prioritizes waste and targets 75% fill, penalizing almost full bins. The 3rd incorporates a "diversity bonus" intended to spread items across bins and weights the priorities using fixed factors (0.6, 0.3, 0.1).

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), the functions are identical, indicating a potential issue in ranking or a missed difference.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), these are identical and incomplete. They declare parameters like `waste_epsilon`, `target_fill_ratio`, `fill_std_dev_factor`, `almost_full_threshold_ratio`, and `almost_full_penalty` but don't implement any logic.

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), they both focus on waste minimization and a target fill level of 75%. They differ slightly in how the target fill distance is calculated.

Overall: The best heuristics combine waste minimization with a target fill level (often around 50-75%). More successful heuristics involve a good balance in assigning the weights for each factor that is used to calculate the final priorities (e.g. waste minimization, target fill). The weaker ones tend to either omit key elements, have less refined calculations, or fail to effectively combine different factors. Some heuristics are also simply duplicates.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating multiple factors with appropriate weights. Refine calculations to accurately reflect the desired behavior. Avoid redundancy and incomplete implementations. Prioritize waste minimization and target fill levels in bin packing problems, as these generally have a significant impact on performance.
