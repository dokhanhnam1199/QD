Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for heuristic design. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Waste reduction, resource utilization, balanced distribution, simplicity, direct measurement.

*   **Advice:** Focus on quantifiable metrics related to resource usage and imbalance. Prioritize heuristics that directly minimize waste and maximize utilization across multiple dimensions.

*   **Avoid:** Abstract concepts, over-complication, indirect proxies for performance.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are grounded in tangible improvements. Measure what matters (waste, utilization), balance competing needs, and keep it simple to improve the odds of creating a good heuristic!
