Okay, I understand the goal: to redefine "Current self-reflection" into a more actionable and effective guide for designing heuristics, explicitly avoiding pitfalls identified in "Ineffective self-reflection." Let's aim for clarity, conciseness, and practical advice.

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Efficiency, accuracy, balance, directness, simplicity, validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics focusing on directly measurable objectives like waste reduction and resource utilization. Combine relevant factors with clear, justifiable weights. Thoroughly validate the heuristic's performance across diverse scenarios.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on speed optimizations (premature optimization). Abstract analogies instead of direct measurements. Unnecessarily complex calculations.
*   **Explanation:** Emphasize fundamental objectives and validation. Prioritize understanding the problem and creating a transparent, well-justified heuristic over purely speed-focused or overly complicated approaches.
