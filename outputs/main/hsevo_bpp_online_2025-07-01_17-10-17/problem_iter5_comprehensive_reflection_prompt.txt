{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize vectorization for speed. Focus on key factors like waste minimization and target fill. Experiment with combining different factors using weighted sums, but be mindful of potential overfitting and the need for careful weight tuning.\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize direct measures of waste and utilization over complex analogies. A combination of factors that promote efficient packing and balanced distribution often yields better results than relying on a single, abstract concept. Furthermore, avoid over-engineering the solution with needlessly complex calculations.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
