**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the top-performing heuristics use a combination of factors, including waste minimization, encouraging bins to be closer to half-full, and penalizing almost-full bins. The worst performing heuristics, focus only on a gravity/momentum analogy, without incorporating factors that directly address waste and bin utilization. (2nd best) vs (second worst) is nearly identical to (best) vs (second worst). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that there are no differences between the code, which is peculiar given that they are ranked differently. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical and perform poorly. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both use similar gravitational/momentum concepts, but the second worst does incorporate avoidance of bins that cannot fit the item. Overall: The better heuristics prioritize a balance between minimizing waste, targeting a good fill level (around half-full), and preventing bins from becoming excessively full, while penalizing bins that cannot fit an item. They also avoid overly clever analogies that don't directly contribute to these goals.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize direct measures of waste and utilization over complex analogies. A combination of factors that promote efficient packing and balanced distribution often yields better results than relying on a single, abstract concept. Furthermore, avoid over-engineering the solution with needlessly complex calculations.
