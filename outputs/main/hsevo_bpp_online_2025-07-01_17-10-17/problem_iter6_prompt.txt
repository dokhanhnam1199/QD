Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Assign priorities to bins based on waste minimization and target fill.\"\"\"\n\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n    distances = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    \n    # Prioritize bins where item nearly fits, less wasted space.\n    base_priority = 1 / (distances + epsilon)\n    \n    # Encourage bins towards half-full state.\n    half_full_target = (bins_remain_cap - item) - (bins_remain_cap / 2.0)\n    half_full_priority = 1 / (np.abs(half_full_target) + epsilon)\n\n    priorities = base_priority + half_full_priority\n    \n    # Zero out invalid bins.\n    priorities[bins_remain_cap < item] = 0\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on practicality and avoiding pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Measurable outcomes, efficiency, adaptability, transparency.\n\n*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in quantifiable performance metrics (e.g., waste percentage, target satisfaction). Prioritize simple, easily understood mechanisms and favor methods that promote efficient resource use and balanced workload distribution.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on complex or abstract ideas. Minimize unnecessary computational overhead.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on interpretable heuristics based on directly measurable factors, making it easier to understand the logic and adjust parameters effectively.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
