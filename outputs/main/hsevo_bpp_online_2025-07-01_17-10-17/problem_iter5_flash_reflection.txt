**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best and worst heuristics are identical, suggesting that the ranking is based on external factors, not code differences.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we observe that both are identical. This suggests a possible issue in the ranking methodology or data. The heuristics include waste minimization, target fill (75%), and a diversity bonus based on post-fit capacity. Weights are applied to combine these factors.
*   Comparing (5th) vs (6th) vs (7th), these functions are identical. They prioritize bins based on waste, fill level, and penalize almost-full bins. This again highlights an issue with the ranking, as identical heuristics should not have different ranks.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (8th), the former uses numpy for vectorized operations while the latter uses a `for` loop, making the former much more efficient. The former also factors in half-full fill target, while the latter focuses on penalizing near-full bins.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (9th), (10th), (11th), (12th), the first one focus on waste minimization and half-full target, while the others combine waste minimization, capacity utilization and balance item size vs remaining capacity.
*   Comparing (14th) vs (15th), the codes are identical. They focuses on combining waste minimization, target fill level.
*   Comparing (16th) vs (17th), the codes are identical. They prioritizes bins based on waste and fill level, avoiding overfilling.
*   Comparing (18th) vs (19th) vs (20th), the codes are identical. They assigns priorities based on waste minimization, target fill level and bin utilization.

Overall: The best heuristics seem to focus on a combination of waste minimization and target fill levels. Some heuristics introduce a diversity bonus or penalize almost-full bins. The use of NumPy for vectorized operations is important for efficiency. The later heuristics attempt to combine multiple factors, but the effectiveness depends on the chosen weights and the specific problem instance.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, prioritize vectorization for speed. Focus on key factors like waste minimization and target fill. Experiment with combining different factors using weighted sums, but be mindful of potential overfitting and the need for careful weight tuning.
