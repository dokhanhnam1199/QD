Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on practicality and avoiding pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Measurable outcomes, efficiency, adaptability, transparency.

*   **Advice:** Ground heuristic design in quantifiable performance metrics (e.g., waste percentage, target satisfaction). Prioritize simple, easily understood mechanisms and favor methods that promote efficient resource use and balanced workload distribution.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on complex or abstract ideas. Minimize unnecessary computational overhead.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on interpretable heuristics based on directly measurable factors, making it easier to understand the logic and adjust parameters effectively.
