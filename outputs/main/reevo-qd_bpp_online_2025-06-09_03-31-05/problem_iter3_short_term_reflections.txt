Prioritize tight fits and penalize infeasible placements. Exploit domain knowledge (First-Fit Decreasing).

Consider fitting, remaining space, bin utilization, and penalizing infeasible assignments for improved heuristics.

Consider remaining space, bin utilization, and penalizing infeasibility for better bin packing heuristics.

Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balance filling existing bins (exploitation) with starting new ones (exploration). Consider bin utilization.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness. Penalize bins that cannot fit the item.

Consider remaining space, encourage full bins, and penalize infeasible placements.

Consider remaining space, incentivize near-full bins, and penalize infeasible placements for improved performance.

Prioritize tight fits, boost near-full bins, and penalize infeasible placements. Consider remaining space relationships.

Prioritize tight fits, utilize domain knowledge (almost full), and penalize infeasible assignments.

Prioritize tight fits. Consider remaining space and bin fullness when assigning priorities.
