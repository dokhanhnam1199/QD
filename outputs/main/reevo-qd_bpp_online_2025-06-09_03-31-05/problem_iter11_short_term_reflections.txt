Exploiting domain knowledge (item size, remaining capacity) with nuanced boosting and penalization creates better heuristics.

Exploiting bin capacity, remaining space, and fit tightness improves packing density. Prioritize feasible and almost-full bins.

Consider remaining space, incentivize near-full bins, and penalize infeasible assignments for enhanced performance.

Exploiting domain knowledge (fitting/remaining space) yields better heuristics than generic log ratios. Penalize infeasibility.

Prioritize tight fits, consider "almost full" bins, and penalize bins that don't fit the item.

Exploiting domain knowledge (fit, remaining space) & nuanced rewards/penalties vastly improves heuristic performance.

Consider fitting, remaining space, and bin fullness. Dynamically adjust priorities based on feasibility.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, and add significant bonuses for near-full bins and snug fits.

Exploit domain knowledge: favor snug fits, penalize infeasibility, and prioritize near-full bins.

Consider remaining space, prioritize snug fits and avoid infeasible assignments with large penalties.
