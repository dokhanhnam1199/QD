Exploiting remaining space, prioritizing near-full bins, and handling infeasibility improve bin-packing heuristics.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize infeasible bins. Consider non-linear scaling and multiple fit levels for refined control.

Consider fitting heuristics, remaining space, item size, and penalize infeasible solutions.

Exploit bin capacity; prioritize near-full bins, penalize infeasibility. Add exploration/randomization to avoid local optima.

Prioritize tight fits, incentivize bin utilization, and penalize infeasibility for improved BPP heuristics.

Favor tight fits, penalize infeasibility. Prioritize filling bins completely; boost near-full bins for better packing.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, and consider "almost full" states with boosting. Avoid undefined behavior.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize large gaps, and heavily penalize infeasible bins.

Prioritize tight fits and nearly full bins. Penalize bins when items don't fit.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize large gaps and no fits. Adjust penalties/rewards based on item size.
