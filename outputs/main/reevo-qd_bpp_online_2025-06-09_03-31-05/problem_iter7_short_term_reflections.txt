Consider remaining space, almost-full bins, and infeasibility handling for better bin packing heuristics.

Exploiting domain knowledge (fit, remaining space) and boosting near-full bins improves packing efficiency.

Exploiting domain knowledge (fitting, space) with nuanced rewards/penalties outperforms simple mathematical transformations.

Exploiting domain knowledge (item fit, remaining space) and handling infeasibility improves heuristic performance.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize large gaps, and consider item size when boosting priority.

Consider remaining space, fullness, tightness, and item size for nuanced bin selection.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize large gaps, and handle infeasibility explicitly for improved bin packing.

Prioritize tight fits and almost-full bins. Penalize bins when the item doesn't fit.

Exploit bin capacity, prioritize near-full bins, and penalize poor fits to improve packing efficiency.

Exploiting remaining space, preferring tighter fits, and penalizing infeasible solutions are key to improved performance.
