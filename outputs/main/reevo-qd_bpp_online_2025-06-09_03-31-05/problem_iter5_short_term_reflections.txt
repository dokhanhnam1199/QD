Exploit bin capacity differences. Prioritize tight fits and penalize infeasible assignments significantly.

Consider fitting, remaining space, bin fullness, and handling infeasible cases for better bin packing.

Consider remaining space, "almost full" boosts, and handling infeasibility explicitly for better bin packing.

Exploiting remaining space, boosting near-full bins, and penalizing infeasibility improve packing density.

Capacity utilization, remaining space, and fitting feasibility are crucial for bin selection in online BPP.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize infeasibility, and use inverse remaining space for bin selection.

Consider remaining space, bin fullness, and infeasibility. Prioritize fitting and filling bins efficiently.

Consider remaining space, prioritize near-full bins, and penalize infeasible placements harshly.

Exploit remaining space, prioritize near-full bins, and penalize infeasible assignments for effective bin packing.

Exploiting remaining capacity and favoring near-full bins improves packing density.
