Okay, let's craft a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focused on superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K tip! Here’s a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Dynamic Exploration, Robustness, Adaptive Temperature, Best-Fit Hybrid.
* **Advice:** Focus on *adaptive* exploration (temperature scaling linked to bin utilization) *combined* with a streamlined best-fit core. Prioritize minimizing wasted space *while* actively seeking diverse bin placements.
* **Avoid:** Static exploration rewards, solely minimizing immediate waste, and overly complex logic. Don’t fall into the trap of prioritizing probabilistic selection *over* informed best-fit.
* **Explanation:** Robust heuristics balance exploitation (best-fit) & exploration (softmax). Dynamic adjustment responds to the problem state, preventing premature convergence and enhancing overall solution quality. Simplicity aids maintainability.
