Okay, let's distill actionable heuristic design advice from this extensive self-reflection. Here's a breakdown geared towards maximizing performance, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Adaptive Temperature Scaling, Softmax, Bin Utilization, Exploration/Exploitation, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Dynamically adjust softmax temperature *directly* with bin utilization â€“ higher temperature when bins are full (encourage exploration), lower when empty (exploit best fit). Implement temperature clamping (0.1-1.0). Focus on *complete* and readable code.
* **Avoid:** Static exploration bonuses, `argmax` selections, arbitrary constants, & complex heuristics solely prioritizing immediate gain. Don't prematurely commit to a single bin.
* **Explanation:** The core issue is balancing exploration & exploitation. Bin utilization is a *direct* indicator of how much exploration is needed. Softmax with adaptive temperature provides a stable, probabilistic selection mechanism avoiding local optima.
