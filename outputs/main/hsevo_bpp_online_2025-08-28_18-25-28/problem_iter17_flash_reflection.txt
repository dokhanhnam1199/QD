**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, they are identical. Comparing 1st/2nd vs 3rd, the main difference is the introduction of a temperature parameter and an exponential scoring function based on bin utilization, attempting to balance exploration and exploitation. However, it prematurely selects the best bin *before* normalization, making the temperature effectively useless. 3rd vs 4th shows 4th correctly normalizes the scores using a softmax, providing probabilities.  4th-16th are nearly identical variations on the softmax approach, differing primarily in how the temperature is calculated and applied. Heuristics 13-20 all introduce a small 'exploration bonus' to the best bin, which is good.  Comparing (1st/2nd) vs (3rd-12th), the latter group is better, but inefficiently implemented. Comparing 13th/14th vs 15th/16th/17th/18th, they seem to converge on using bin utilization for temperature scaling, a good approach. 19th and 20th also adapt temperature based on bin utilization. The consistent element across the stronger heuristics (13th-20th) is the use of softmax to derive probabilities, scaling with a temperature derived from bin utilization. Heuristics that directly select `best_bin_index` *before* applying probabilities miss the probabilistic exploration aspect. Overall, the best heuristics balance best-fit with probabilistic exploration, dynamically adjusting temperature based on bin utilization. The key improvements are consistent softmax normalization, and the incorporation of bin utilization into the temperature.

**Experience:**

Adaptive temperature scaling based on bin utilization is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation.  Softmax normalization enables probabilistic bin selection. Avoid premature selection of a best bin before normalization. Exploration bonuses can nudge towards less crowded bins, and prevent premature convergence on a local optimum.
