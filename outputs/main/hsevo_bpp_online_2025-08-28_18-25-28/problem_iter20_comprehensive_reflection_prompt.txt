{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize adaptive temperature scaling informed by bin utilization.  Small, normalized exploration bonuses can refine results, but excessive boosting can be detrimental.  A temperature clamping mechanism ensures stable exploration behavior and avoids extreme probabilities.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize normalization and probabilistic selection. Avoid negative priorities. Focus on strategies that balance fitting items well (minimizing waste) with exploring diverse bin options. Softmax approaches are more robust than solely minimizing waste across all possible bins.\n\nEffective bin-packing heuristics should prioritize minimizing waste while retaining exploration. Softmax prioritization with temperature scaling provides a robust mechanism for balancing these goals. Avoid redundant implementations and prioritize completeness over complexity.  A clear, concise best-fit approach, coupled with a well-tuned softmax, consistently outperforms more convoluted solutions.\n\nEffective heuristics for bin packing should prioritize both immediate gain (best fit) and long-term balance (exploration/diversity). Static diversity rewards are less effective than dynamic adjustments based on bin utilization. Simplicity is often key; overly complex heuristics can hinder performance and interpretability. Avoid code duplication.\n\nPrioritize exploration techniques (softmax, bonuses) alongside best-fit for robust bin packing. Dynamically adjusting exploration based on remaining capacity or bin utilization (temperature scaling) improves performance. Avoid purely deterministic approaches. Stability matters; `argmax` can be sensitive to small changes.\n\nAdaptive temperature scaling is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation in bin-packing heuristics. Favoring softmax with temperature adjustments based on remaining capacity or bin utilization consistently outperforms static or greedy approaches. Avoid unnecessary complexity like arbitrary boosts or imports.\n\nAdaptive temperature scaling based on bin utilization is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation.  Softmax normalization enables probabilistic bin selection. Avoid premature selection of a best bin before normalization. Exploration bonuses can nudge towards less crowded bins, and prevent premature convergence on a local optimum.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
