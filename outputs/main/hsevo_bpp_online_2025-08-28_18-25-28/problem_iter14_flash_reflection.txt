**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v1` (1st) vs `priority_v2` (2nd), we observe `v1` is a null heuristic, assigning equal priority (0) to all bins, essentially random selection. `v2` introduces a basic best-fit approach, prioritizing bins that can accommodate the item and slightly boosting the best-fit bin. Comparing `v2` vs `priority_v2` (3rd), they are identical.  `priority_v2` (4th) attempts to add exploration via an exponential term and temperature, but the `argmax` step negates much of the exploration, essentially becoming a greedy algorithm. `priority_v2` (5th) and (6th) use softmax exploration with temperature scaling, but `v6` introduces a somewhat arbitrary exploration bonus. Comparing `priority_v2` (7th) and (8th), both are softmax explorations with adaptive temperature, but `v7` has unnecessary imports. `priority_v2` (9th), (10th), (11th) are identical to (8th).  `priority_v2` (12th) & (13th) are identical, both employ softmax. `priority_v2` (14th) introduces more temperature adjustment based on bin utilization which looks better than the previous options. `priority_v2` (15th) further refines temperature based on overall bin utilization. `priority_v2` (16th), (17th) and (19th) all appear identical, employing softmax with a constant boost to the best bin. `priority_v2` (18th) adjusts temperature based on the number of possible bins. The best heuristics consistently utilize softmax exploration with adaptive temperature scaling based on bin utilization or remaining capacity, aiming to balance exploitation (best fit) and exploration (trying different bins).  The use of unnecessary imports and arbitrary boosting factors detract from performance. Overall, the best heuristics are those that dynamically adjust exploration based on the current state of the bins.

**Experience:**

Adaptive temperature scaling is crucial for balancing exploration and exploitation in bin-packing heuristics. Favoring softmax with temperature adjustments based on remaining capacity or bin utilization consistently outperforms static or greedy approaches. Avoid unnecessary complexity like arbitrary boosts or imports.
