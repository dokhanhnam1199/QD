**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the only difference is the `np.clip` function in the 2nd heuristic, limiting the temperature between 0.1 and 1.0. This suggests the temperature calculation in the first heuristic can sometimes result in values outside a reasonable range, which the clipping in the 2nd heuristic addresses.  Heuristics 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are identical, indicating no improvement.

Comparing 4th vs 5th, the 4th version directly uses `np.zeros_like` for initialization which is slightly cleaner and potentially faster. It also sets the temperature clip to be explicitly between 0.1 and 1.0. The 5th heuristic re-calculates `fit_scores` unnecessarily, and seems less readable. 

Comparing 6th/7th vs 8th/9th, the versions seem largely identical except that 6th/7th use `if possible_bins[best_bin_index]` condition after `np.argmax` to avoid errors (improving robustness), and the 7th version consolidates the max/min logic into a single line.

Comparing 10th vs 11th/12th, 10th explicitly addresses a potential divide-by-zero error in the temperature calculation by adding a small value (1e-6). Heuristics 11th and 12th attempt similar temperature handling but are less concise.

Heuristics 13th, 14th, and 15th are nearly identical. 16th/17th/18th are also similar, but simplify code. Heuristic 19th is very similar to 18th. 

Overall: The best heuristics (1st-4th) focus on combining best-fit with a temperature-scaled softmax, adapting temperature based on bin utilization.  The later heuristics often refine temperature calculations for stability and readability, often adding a clipping mechanism. The addition of a small bonus to the best bin (e.g., multiplying the probability by 1.2 or 0.2) is consistent but its value is empirically driven. Utilizing `np.zeros_like` for array initialization and avoiding unnecessary re-calculations are minor but beneficial improvements.

**Experience:**

Adaptive temperature scaling based on bin utilization is crucial. Clipping the temperature within a reasonable range (0.1-1.0) prevents instability. Handling potential division-by-zero errors enhances robustness. Prioritize code readability and avoid redundant calculations. Small probability boosts to the selected bin seem helpful for exploration.
