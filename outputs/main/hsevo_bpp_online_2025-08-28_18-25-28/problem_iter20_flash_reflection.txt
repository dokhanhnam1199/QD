**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic incorporates temperature scaling based on bin utilization *and* a slight boost to the highest probability bin, refining best-fit with exploration. The 2nd is a very basic best-fit with a simple boost, lacking adaptive temperature control. 

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both are essentially identical to the 1st and 2nd, respectively, with the same strengths and weaknesses.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), both use adaptive softmax with bin utilization. The 6th refines temperature calculation, considering overall bin utilization and clamping to a reasonable range (0.1-1.0), leading to potentially more stable exploration.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), they are identical. (8th) adds an explicit temperature parameter, offering some control but sacrificing the adaptive nature.

Comparing (9th) vs (8th), (9th) reduces the boost to the best bin to 0.5, while (8th) gives a boost of 2.0. This subtle change can reduce over-exploitation.

Comparing (11th) vs (13th), both incorporate exploration bonuses, but (13th) normalizes the priorities to sum to 1, improving probability distribution properties.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th), both use a 1/waste calculation, but (15th) incorporates a temperature factor and a more substantial exploration bonus, potentially enhancing exploration.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), both are very similar and use an adaptive temperature-scaled softmax exploration. The only different is the if statement on the best bin index.

Comparing (18th) vs (19th), they are identical.

Comparing (20th) vs (1st), the 20th is similar to the 1st but uses a different temperature calculation and a larger bonus, which might lead to instability.

Overall: Adaptive temperature scaling, based on bin utilization, consistently improves performance. Small exploration bonuses to the best bin can be helpful, but require careful tuning to avoid over-exploitation. Normalizing probabilities ensures a valid distribution. Utilizing more sophisticated temperature calculations, and ensuring the temperature remains within reasonable bounds, enhances stability. A focus on incorporating bin utilization for adapting exploration is a recurring theme in the better heuristics.

**Experience:**

Prioritize adaptive temperature scaling informed by bin utilization.  Small, normalized exploration bonuses can refine results, but excessive boosting can be detrimental.  A temperature clamping mechanism ensures stable exploration behavior and avoids extreme probabilities.
