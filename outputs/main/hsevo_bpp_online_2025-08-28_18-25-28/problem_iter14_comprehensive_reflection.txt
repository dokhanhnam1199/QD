Okay, let's dissect this and formulate truly insightful advice for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K reward! Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" based on your input:

* **Keywords:** Dynamic Exploration, Softmax Temperature, Bin Utilization, Waste Minimization, Adaptive Control.
* **Advice:** Center heuristics around *adaptive* exploration – specifically, dynamically adjust softmax temperature based on bin utilization *and* remaining capacity. Prioritize simplicity; a strong best-fit core *with* dynamic softmax beats complex, convoluted methods.
* **Avoid:** Static rewards, arbitrary boosts, `argmax` reliance, and unnecessary complexity. Resist normalization that isn’t directly tied to the decision process. Don't focus solely on immediate gain (best-fit) *or* pure exploration.
* **Explanation:** The core issue is balancing exploitation (best fit) and exploration (diversity). Dynamic temperature scaling in softmax *directly* responds to the problem state, encouraging exploration when bins are sparse and exploitation when nearing capacity. This adaptive behavior is key.
