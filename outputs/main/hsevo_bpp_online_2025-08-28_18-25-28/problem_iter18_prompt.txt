Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    return priorities\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(possible_bins):\n        return priorities\n    \n    best_bin_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item)\n    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0\n    priorities[best_bin_index] = 2.0\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's dissect this and formulate truly impactful advice for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K tip! Here\u2019s a refined self-reflection, distilled into actionable guidance:\n\n* **Keywords:** Dynamic Exploration, Softmax Temperature, Bin Utilization, Adaptive Balancing.\n* **Advice:** Center heuristic design around *adaptive* exploration strategies. Prioritize dynamically adjusting exploration (via temperature scaling in softmax) based on real-time bin utilization *and* remaining problem space.\n* **Avoid:** Static rewards, premature commitment (argmax), and overly complex implementations. Resist the urge to add \"features\" without demonstrable impact on exploration/exploitation balance.\n* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren\u2019t about *finding* the best solution quickly, but *efficiently searching* a vast space.  Adaptive temperature scaling ensures continued exploration even as solutions converge, preventing local optima traps.\n\n\n\n**Step-by-step thought process:**\n\n1. **Identifying the Core:** Both reflections emphasize balancing exploration and exploitation. The \"Current\" reflection is stronger because it focuses on *how* to dynamically manage that balance.\n2. **Deconstructing \u201cIneffective\u201d:** The \"Ineffective\" reflection highlights what *doesn't* work \u2013 static approaches, premature decisions, and complexity. These are pitfalls to actively avoid.\n3. **Refining Language:**  The original \"Current\" reflection was slightly repetitive. I\u2019ve streamlined it to focus on \"adaptive\" behavior and the core mechanisms driving it.\n4. **Actionable Advice:** The advice is framed to be directly applicable to heuristic *design*, not just observation of a working system.\n5. **The $999K Focus:** A winning heuristic needs to be robust *across* problem instances. Adaptive strategies are far more likely to achieve this than static or greedy methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
