**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v1` (2nd), the first introduces a sophisticated scoring system based on best-fit, bin utilization, and a temperature-scaled softmax, while the second returns zero priorities.  The 1st uses a temperature parameter adjusted by bin utilization for more nuanced bin selection, crucial for performance.

Comparing `priority_v2` (3rd) vs `priority_v2` (4th), both are identical implementations, representing a redundant entry.

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v2` (5th), we see the 1st is a more robust implementation using temperature scaling and softmax for a probabilistic choice, while the 5th only assigns 1 or 2 to bins, lacking smoothness.

`priority_v2` (7th) and `priority_v2` (8th) are duplicates.  Analyzing `priority_v2` (10th) reveals it tries to normalize scores but ultimately assigns all probability to the best bin, eliminating exploration. `priority_v2` (13th) is similar, but better temperature control.  `priority_v2` (17th) uses reciprocal fit scores which can be problematic with near-zero remaining capacity.  `priority_v2` (18th) and `priority_v2` (20th) add a small boost to the best bin, which is a minor improvement, but not as effective as the temperature-scaled softmax. The later heuristics (11th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 19th) include duplicates or variations that simplify temperature calculation without the adaptive quality of the best heuristics.

Overall: The core strength of the best heuristics lies in the adaptive temperature scaling based on bin utilization and the softmax probability distribution.  This balance between exploitation (best fit) and exploration (probabilistic bin selection) is key.  Avoiding division by zero or near-zero values in the scoring function is critical. The repeated, and simpler heuristics lack these crucial features and therefore perform worse.


**Experience:**

Adaptive temperature scaling, tied to bin utilization, is paramount for robust bin packing heuristics. Softmax provides a smooth probabilistic assignment. Avoid hard assignments (like only assigning 1.0 to the best bin) and reciprocal scores prone to instability. Prioritize exploration alongside exploitation.
