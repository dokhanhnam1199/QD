**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v1` (2nd), the first incorporates a more sophisticated exploration bonus based on bin waste, while the second is essentially a no-op, returning zero priorities.  `priority_v2` (1st) and `priority_v2` (3rd) are functionally identical. `priority_v2` (4th & 5th) are identical and calculate fit scores and exploration bonuses, then boosts the best bin, but use `argmax` which may not always be the most stable.  `priority_v2` (6th & 7th) are also identical, introducing an average remaining capacity check and a bonus dependent on bin fullness.  `priority_v2` (8th-10th) employ softmax exploration, with temperature scaling. These show a shift toward probabilistic bin selection.  `priority_v2` (11th) uses a sigmoid function to scale scores.  `priority_v2` (12th) is simpler softmax.  `priority_v2` (13th) is very similar to (8th-10th). `priority_v2` (14th) is attempting a Gaussian exploration bonus which is promising. `priority_v2` (15th & 16th) are identical, using normalized waste and dynamically adjusting temperature.  `priority_v2` (17th & 18th) are also identical, refining the temperature-scaled softmax with a boost to the best bin. `priority_v2` (19th) adjusts temperature based on bin availability. `priority_v2` (20th) introduces randomness in temperature, which is a less-structured approach. Overall, the best heuristics consistently combine best-fit with some form of exploration, often employing softmax or similar probabilistic methods. Temperature scaling is a recurring theme.

**Experience:**

Prioritize exploration techniques (softmax, bonuses) alongside best-fit for robust bin packing. Dynamically adjusting exploration based on remaining capacity or bin utilization (temperature scaling) improves performance. Avoid purely deterministic approaches. Stability matters; `argmax` can be sensitive to small changes.
