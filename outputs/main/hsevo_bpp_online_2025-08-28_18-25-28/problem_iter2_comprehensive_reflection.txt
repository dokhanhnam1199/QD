Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for superior heuristic design – aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, explicitly addressing avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection:

* **Keywords:** Probabilistic Choice, Exploration-Exploitation, Softmax, Normalization, Diversity.
* **Advice:**  Focus on *relative* fitness (Softmax temperature tuning is key!). Reward bin diversity *alongside* good fit.  Normalize item/bin scores to prevent dominance by scale.
* **Avoid:** Absolute waste minimization, rigid prioritization, premature convergence to seemingly "best" bins.
* **Explanation:**  Softmax promotes exploration. Normalization prevents bias. Balancing fit & diversity yields robust solutions, escaping local optima – vital for heuristic scalability.
