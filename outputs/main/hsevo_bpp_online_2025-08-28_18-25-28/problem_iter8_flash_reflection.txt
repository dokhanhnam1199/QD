**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v1` (worst) vs `priority_v2` (best), we see `v1` provides no prioritization at all, assigning equal priority to all bins.  `v2` at least identifies viable bins and gives a higher priority to the best-fit one. Comparing `priority_v2` (best) vs `priority_v3` (2nd), they are identical, which is odd, suggesting a duplication.  Comparing `priority_v4` (4th) vs `priority_v5` (5th) and `priority_v7` (7th), they are also identical.

Comparing `priority_v1` vs `priority_v2` (best), it's evident that simply identifying feasible bins and prioritizing the best fit is a massive improvement over random assignment.  From `priority_v6` onwards, the heuristics attempt to combine best-fit with softmax approaches, aiming for a balance between exploitation (best fit) and exploration (softmax).  `v6` and `v9` have an extra boost to the best bin after the softmax calculations, potentially leading to premature convergence.  The versions incorporating `diversity_reward` (v10-v18) attempt to prevent a single bin from dominating, which is beneficial.  However, the formula for the diversity reward `1.0 / (np.sum(possible_bins) + 1e-6)` appears constant given the input and doesn't truly reflect bin usage, and the temperature is either fixed or has limited variation. `v19` and `v20` introduce a random temperature, potentially improving exploration but adding computational cost. `v18` seems to be a simplified version of `v19` and `v20`.

Overall: The most successful heuristics blend best-fit with softmax or probabilistic selection. Diversity rewards are valuable but need to be more dynamic and context-aware. The best heuristics (v2) are simple and effective.  Heuristics introducing randomness, while potentially helpful, add complexity and may not always lead to superior performance, and duplication (v2, v3, v4, v5, v7, v12, v13, v14, v15, v16, v17) must be avoided.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics for bin packing should prioritize both immediate gain (best fit) and long-term balance (exploration/diversity). Static diversity rewards are less effective than dynamic adjustments based on bin utilization. Simplicity is often key; overly complex heuristics can hinder performance and interpretability. Avoid code duplication.
