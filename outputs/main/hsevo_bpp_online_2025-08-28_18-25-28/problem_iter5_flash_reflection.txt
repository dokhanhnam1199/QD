**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v1` (worst) vs `priority_v2` (best), we observe `v1` is a null operation, returning a zeroed array regardless of item or bin capacities â€“ offering no prioritization.  `v2` attempts to prioritize by identifying possible bins and assigning higher priority to the best-fitting bin.

Comparing `priority_v2` (best) vs `priority_v3` (second worst), `v2` utilizes a softmax approach for exploration while `v3` is incomplete (missing implementation).

Comparing `priority_v2` (best) vs `priority_v4` (9th), `v4` introduces temperature scaling and a diversity reward. While attempting balance, it normalizes fit *after* determining validity, potentially obscuring subtle differences, and the reward is a simple inverse of bin count.  `v2`'s direct softmax on remaining capacity provides a cleaner prioritization.

Comparing `priority_v5` (6th) vs `priority_v6` (10th), both attempt best-fit + softmax. `v5` offers a more concise calculation of `fit_scores`. `v6` is incomplete (missing implementation).

Comparing `priority_v7` (11th) vs `priority_v8` (12th), both use inverse waste with softmax. `v7` is slightly simpler and clearer.

Comparing `priority_v9` (4th) vs `priority_v10` (incomplete), `v9` is complete and implements a temperature-scaled softmax with diversity reward, whereas `v10` is unfinished. 

Heuristics 13-20 all are very similar, all applying a softmax on inverse waste. Minor differences in normalization and temperature application exist, but the core logic is duplicated.  This highlights redundancy and lack of substantial innovation. The best utilize softmax, and a temperature parameter, while incomplete functions or null operations receive low ranking.

Overall: The successful heuristics converge on a theme of combining best-fit (minimizing waste) with a probabilistic softmax selection strategy. This balances exploitation of well-fitting bins with exploration of potentially better-suited, but less obvious, options. Diversity rewards are valuable but need careful implementation and tuning.



**Experience:**

Effective bin-packing heuristics should prioritize minimizing waste while retaining exploration. Softmax prioritization with temperature scaling provides a robust mechanism for balancing these goals. Avoid redundant implementations and prioritize completeness over complexity.  A clear, concise best-fit approach, coupled with a well-tuned softmax, consistently outperforms more convoluted solutions.
