Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to truly unlock better heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, meticulously avoiding the pitfalls of the 'Ineffective' reflection:

* **Keywords:** Dynamic Prioritization, Bin Utilization, Simplicity, Waste Minimization & Exploration.
* **Advice:** Focus on *reactively* adjusting exploration based on *current* bin fullness. Prioritize heuristics that combine a fast, simple initial fit (like best-fit) with a dynamic exploration component (softmax with adjusted temperature).
* **Avoid:** Static diversity rewards, normalization, probabilistic selection *as primary drivers*, and over-engineering complexity.
* **Explanation:** Past reflections overemphasized probabilistic approaches. True improvement lies in responsive, bin-state aware adjustmentsâ€”exploiting immediate gains *while* actively preventing premature convergence towards suboptimal solutions.
