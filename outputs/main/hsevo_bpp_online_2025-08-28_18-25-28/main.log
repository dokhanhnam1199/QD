### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize normalization and probabilistic selection. Avoid negative priorities. Focus on strategies that balance fitting items well (minimizing waste) with exploring diverse bin options. Softmax approaches are more robust than solely minimizing waste across all possible bins.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

[2025-08-28 18:29:16,178][root][INFO] - Crossover Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.any(valid_bins):
        priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item)
        priorities[~valid_bins] = -1.0
    else:
        priorities[:] = -1.0
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities[valid_bins] = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both prioritize bins based on remaining capacity, but the 1st is a null heuristic (always returns zeros). The 2nd attempts to find the best fit (smallest remaining capacity after placing the item) and assigns higher priority to it. Comparing 2nd vs 3rd, they are nearly identical.  Comparing 3rd vs 4th, both use `1 / (waste + 1e-6)`, but the 4th uses `feasible_bins` instead of `valid_bins`. Comparing 4th vs 5th, the 5th uses a sigmoid function which seems more nuanced but could be less effective. Comparing 5th vs 6th, the 6th normalizes using a softmax approach, making it a probabilistic choice – a potentially good strategy. Comparing 6th vs 7th, the 7th picks the bin with minimum waste *across all feasible bins*, which is less refined than the 6th's probabilistic approach. Comparing 7th vs 8th, 8th is identical to 6th. Comparing 8th vs 9th, 9th is identical to 6th. Comparing 9th vs 10th, 10th uses min_waste similar to 7th but also adds a small number to the denominator and is less refined than the probabilistic choice made by 6th, 8th, and 9th. Comparing 10th vs 11th, the 11th introduces negative priorities which, while attempting to discourage infeasible bins, might be less informative than simply ignoring them. Comparing 11th vs 12th, 12th is a simplified version of 11th. Comparing 12th vs 13th, 13th is identical to 11th. Comparing 13th vs 14th, 14th simply returns the remaining capacity, lacking any normalization or prioritization beyond feasibility. Comparing 14th vs 15th, 15th is similar but assigns a negative priority to all bins if no valid bin exists. Comparing 15th vs 16th, 16th normalizes using item size, but this normalization seems arbitrary. Comparing 16th vs 17th, 17th is simpler, returning remaining capacity, with a slightly different handling of the no-valid-bin scenario. Comparing 17th vs 18th, 18th returns only the remain cap if the sum of valid bins is > 0. Comparing 18th vs 19th, 19th normalizes with item size like 16th. Comparing 19th vs 20th, 20th assigns -1 to all bins if no valid bins.

Overall, heuristics using a normalized approach (like 6th, 8th, 9th) consistently outperform those relying on raw remaining capacity or introducing negative priorities. The use of softmax (6th, 8th, 9th) appears particularly effective.

Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for superior heuristic design – aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, explicitly addressing avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection:

* **Keywords:** Probabilistic Choice, Exploration-Exploitation, Softmax, Normalization, Diversity.
* **Advice:**  Focus on *relative* fitness (Softmax temperature tuning is key!). Reward bin diversity *alongside* good fit.  Normalize item/bin scores to prevent dominance by scale.
* **Avoid:** Absolute waste minimization, rigid prioritization, premature convergence to seemingly "best" bins.
* **Explanation:**  Softmax promotes exploration. Normalization prevents bias. Balancing fit & diversity yields robust solutions, escaping local optima – vital for heuristic scalability.





Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(possible_bins):
        return priorities
    
    best_bin_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item)
    priorities[possible_bins] = 1.0
    priorities[best_bin_index] = 2.0
    
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for superior heuristic design – aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, explicitly addressing avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection:

* **Keywords:** Probabilistic Choice, Exploration-Exploitation, Softmax, Normalization, Diversity.
* **Advice:**  Focus on *relative* fitness (Softmax temperature tuning is key!). Reward bin diversity *alongside* good fit.  Normalize item/bin scores to prevent dominance by scale.
* **Avoid:** Absolute waste minimization, rigid prioritization, premature convergence to seemingly "best" bins.
* **Explanation:**  Softmax promotes exploration. Normalization prevents bias. Balancing fit & diversity yields robust solutions, escaping local optima – vital for heuristic scalability.





Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Combines softmax prioritization with a small exploration bonus."""
    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities[possible_bins] = scores
    probabilities = np.exp(priorities) / np.sum(np.exp(priorities))
    return probabilities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
