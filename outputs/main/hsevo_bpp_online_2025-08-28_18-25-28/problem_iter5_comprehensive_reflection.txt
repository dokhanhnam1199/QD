Okay, $999K demands *exceptional* heuristic design advice! Let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" based on avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection". Here's a breakdown, optimized for actionable heuristic development:

* **Keywords:** Exploitation-Exploration, Temperature Control, Bin Diversity, Simplification.
* **Advice:** Systematically vary softmax temperature *during* the search â€“ start high for exploration, lower for exploitation. Track bin "fullness" *and* item "fit quality" as separate softmax inputs.
* **Avoid:** Solely focusing on immediate waste minimization; neglecting bin diversity; re-implementing existing bin-fitting logic.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren't just *good* fits, they *find* good fits across a diverse solution space. Temperature control & multi-faceted softmax inputs actively manage this trade-off, boosting performance.
