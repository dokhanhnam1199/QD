Okay, let's distill that extensive self-reflection into actionable heuristic design guidance. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K tip!

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Temperature, Softmax, Bin Utilization, Robustness, Exploration/Exploitation.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *dynamically* adjusting softmax temperature based on bin utilization. Prioritize a robust fit score (handling edge cases like division by zero) and small, normalized exploration boosts *within* the softmax framework.
*   **Avoid:** Static rewards, `argmax` selection, arbitrary constants, and overly complex implementations. Don't prematurely commit to a single bin *before* normalization via softmax.
*   **Explanation:** The core is balancing immediate gain (best-fit) with exploration. Adaptive temperature scaling, driven by bin utilization, is the key. Softmax provides probabilistic selection; avoid manipulating probabilities *after* this normalization unless demonstrably beneficial via rigorous testing.
