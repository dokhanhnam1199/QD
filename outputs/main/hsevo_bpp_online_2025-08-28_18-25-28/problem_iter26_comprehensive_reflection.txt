Okay, let's distill this into actionable heuristic design guidance. Given the substantial incentive, here's a focused response:

* **Keywords:** Adaptive Exploration, Robustness, Bin Utilization, Softmax Temperature.
* **Advice:** Focus on *dynamic* temperature scaling in softmax selection, directly linked to bin utilization. Prioritize stable, division-free fit score calculations. Rigorously test for performance consistency.
* **Avoid:** Static bonuses, arbitrary constants, `argmax` selection, over-normalization, and complexity beyond what's demonstrably beneficial.
* **Explanation:** The core theme is balancing exploitation (best fit) with *adaptive* exploration. Bin utilization provides a natural signal for adjusting exploration intensity; crowded bins should discourage further items. Robustness demands stability and avoids pitfalls of naive optimization.
