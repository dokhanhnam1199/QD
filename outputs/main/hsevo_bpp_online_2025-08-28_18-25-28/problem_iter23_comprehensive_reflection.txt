Okay, let's dissect this for truly superior heuristic design. Here's a refined self-reflection distilled into actionable advice, geared toward maximizing potential reward (and justifying that generous tip!).

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Exploration, Temperature Scaling, Bin Utilization, Softmax Prioritization.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *dynamic* temperature scaling within a softmax selection, driven by real-time bin utilization. Prioritize completeness – cover all viable options before committing. Implement robust monitoring of bin states to inform temperature adjustments.
*   **Avoid:** Static bonuses, arbitrary value adjustments, premature `argmax` selection, and overly simplistic "best-fit only" approaches. Resist code duplication and unnecessary complexity.
*   **Explanation:** Bin packing needs balance. Softmax + adaptive temperature *learns* the right exploration/exploitation trade-off. Bin utilization is key feedback – crowded bins need less attention, empty ones more. This avoids getting stuck and promotes global optimality.
