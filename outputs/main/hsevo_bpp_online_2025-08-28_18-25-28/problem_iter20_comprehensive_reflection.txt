Okay, let's dissect this and formulate truly impactful advice for designing better heuristics, aiming for that $999K! Here’s a breakdown based on the provided texts, focusing on *how* to improve, not just *what* to do:

* **Keywords:** Adaptive Control, Bin Utilization, Softmax, Exploration-Exploitation Balance, Stability.
* **Advice:** Design heuristics with *dynamic* parameters (temperature in softmax, exploration bonuses) directly tied to problem state (bin utilization, remaining capacity). Prioritize clear, modular code for easy adjustment & experimentation.
* **Avoid:** Static rewards, `argmax` selections, overly complex logic, and redundant code. Don't focus solely on immediate "best fit" – long-term bin diversity is vital.
* **Explanation:** The core issue is *reactivity*. Successful heuristics aren’t pre-programmed; they *respond* to the evolving problem landscape. Adaptive temperature scaling and utilization-based bonuses ensure consistent exploration *where needed* – preventing premature convergence and maximizing overall efficiency.
