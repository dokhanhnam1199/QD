**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) these are identical.  They represent a strong baseline: best-fit combined with adaptive temperature-scaled softmax exploration, temperature tuned by bin utilization. (4th) is dramatically simpler and performs poorly, only implementing a basic best-fit with a hard boost. (5th) is identical to (1st) again. (6th) and (7th) are also identical, exhibiting slight variations in variable naming, but otherwise equivalent to the initial good heuristics. (8th) & (9th) are again identical, deviating by calculating temperature with a potentially less effective method (mean of remaining capacities / item). This risks instability when items are large. (10th) & (11th) are identical, using inverse remaining capacity with a small exploration bonus. This lacks the smoothing effect of the softmax. (12th) is different, using a different temperature scaling and exploration bonus but fundamentally still exploring best-fit. (13th) introduces more parameters but is incomplete, ending abruptly. (14th) includes a utilization bonus but the application is limited and the bonus value feels arbitrary. (15th) introduces random exploration with a low probability, adding noise. (16th) is a normalization step, but the bonus is small and applied after normalization. (17th) also applies a bonus, with a similar effect to 16th. (18th) & (19th) are identical: They calculate fit quality and temperature but the temperature calculation isn't well-grounded. The bonus is applied directly. (20th) has a similar structure to (18th)/(19th), but lacks the more nuanced temperature calculation.

Overall: The best heuristics consistently leverage adaptive temperature-scaled softmax, tuned by bin utilization. Simpler heuristics (4th) or those with poorly defined temperature/bonus schemes (8th,9th, 10th, 11th, 14th) perform worse. Introducing randomness (15th) doesnâ€™t consistently improve results. The core successful components are best-fit scoring, temperature scaling based on utilization, and softmax exploration.

**Experience:**

Prioritize combining best-fit with softmax exploration, carefully tuning temperature based on bin utilization.  Avoid arbitrary bonus values; instead, use temperature scaling to control exploration.  Simplicity isn't always best; adaptive mechanisms are crucial for performance. Avoid directly modifying probabilities after softmax unless carefully justified.
