**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v2` (2nd), `priority_v2` (3rd), and `priority_v2` (4th) - these are identical implementations. They represent a very basic 'first fit' approach with minimal prioritization.  `priority_v2` (4th) begins to introduce sophistication with temperature-scaled softmax based on fit and bin utilization.  It’s a step up but the temperature calculation is simplistic.

Comparing `priority_v2` (4th) / (5th) vs `priority_v2` (6th), the latter introduces `np.clip` to the temperature, ensuring it remains within reasonable bounds, enhancing stability. The fit score calculation is more robust using `- (bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item)`.

`priority_v2` (7th) - (10th) refine the temperature scaling using bin utilization, but the utilization calculation `np.sum(bins_remain_cap) / (n_bins * np.max(bins_remain_cap))` seems flawed – it doesn't accurately reflect individual bin utilization and relies heavily on the maximum capacity.

`priority_v2` (11th) - (13th) try a different approach with temperature based directly on bin utilization, and utilizing softmax. The logic is clearer.

`priority_v2` (14th) and (15th) are nearly identical. They attempt to use `1.0 / (np.mean(bin_utilizations) + 1e-6)` as temperature.

`priority_v2` (16th) - (19th) improve the fit score using `1.0 / (remaining_caps - item + 1e-6)`. Adding a small constant prevents division by zero.  Bin utilization-based temperature scaling is used.

`priority_v2` (20th) incorporates a waste/fit quality ratio and adds an exploration bonus. While attempting more sophistication, the introduction of constants (0.1, 0.2) is arbitrary and lacks theoretical justification. The temperature scaling is also less refined than earlier versions.

Overall: The best heuristics incrementally build upon best-fit with adaptive softmax, emphasizing temperature scaling based on bin utilization. The ranking highlights the importance of stable temperature control, robust fit score calculation, and avoiding arbitrary constants. Later versions add complexity without significant improvements, and in some cases, introduce potential instability.

**Experience:**

Adaptive temperature scaling, guided by bin utilization, is crucial.  Prioritize robust fit score calculations that avoid division by zero. Avoid arbitrary constants; design heuristics based on theoretical understanding of the problem, and consistently test for stability and performance gains.
