Prioritize feasibility. Encourage tight packing, penalize wasted space. Consider non-linear relationships.

Prioritize feasibility. Encourage tight packing with bonuses for minimal wasted space. Avoid ratio logarithms.

Feasibility check is crucial. Prioritize bins based on fill ratio and reducing wasted space.

Prioritize feasibility, then maximize fill ratio and minimize wasted space using heuristics.

Prioritize feasibility. Directly reward tight packing and penalize wasted space exponentially.

Feasibility, tight packing, and waste reduction are key. Direct proportion and exponential decay are good choices.

Feasibility matters. Reward tight packing and penalize wasted space for improved performance.

Feasibility, fill ratio, and wasted space are key. Prioritize tight packing while avoiding infeasible bins.

Prioritize feasibility, then maximize fill ratio and minimize wasted space. Exponential decay of wasted space can help.

Prioritize feasibility, then maximize fill ratio while minimizing wasted space.
