Prioritize feasibility. Favor tight packing, penalize wasted space, and consider non-linear scaling.

Feasibility, tight packing, wasted space penalization, and best-fit approximation improve bin selection.

Feasibility check, direct proportion to fill ratio, and penalize wasted space improves bin selection.

Consider feasibility, packing tightness, waste penalization, and bin occupancy for improved heuristics.

Feasibility is key. Prioritize tight packing, and minimize wasted space in feasible bins.

Prioritize feasibility. Favor tight packing with bonus for minimizing wasted space after packing.

Feasibility check, wasted space penalty, and best-fit approximation improve online bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility. Favor tight packing using ratios and penalize wasted space via exponential decay.

Feasibility checks, tight packing encouragement, waste penalization, and occupancy awareness improve bin packing heuristics.

The better code incorporates feasibility, tight packing, and wasted space penalties, improving bin utilization.
