Feasibility checks and non-linear reward/penalty based on wasted space improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility checks, tight packing, waste penalization, and occupancy preference improve bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize feasibility. Encourage tight packing exponentially while penalizing wasted space.

Feasibility checks, and exponential rewarding of tight packing improve online bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility checks, encouraging tight packing, penalizing waste, and favoring occupancy improve online bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility and tight packing. Exponentially penalize wasted space in feasible bins.

Prioritize feasibility, encourage tight packing, and penalize wasted space to improve bin selection.

Feasibility, packing tightness, wasted space penalization, and occupancy preference improve bin selection.
