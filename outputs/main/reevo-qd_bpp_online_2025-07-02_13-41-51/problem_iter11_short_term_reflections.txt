Prioritize feasibility. Penalize wasted space exponentially. Consider bin utilization and encourage tight packing.

Feasibility checks, space waste penalties, capacity utilization, and minimum remaining capacity boosts improve bin packing.

Feasibility, tight packing, and wasted space penalties are key. Adding best-fit and occupancy considerations further improves performance.

Prioritize feasibility, encourage tight packing via exponential rewards, and consider bin occupancy.

Feasibility, wasted space penalization, best-fit approximation, and occupancy awareness are key for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility, then packing tightness, with bonus for minimizing wasted space, avoids log instability.

Feasibility filtering, direct proportion to fill ratio, and wasted space penalty improve bin selection.

Prioritize feasibility, encourage tight packing with exponential rewards, and consider bin occupancy.

Feasibility, tight packing, waste penalization, and occupancy awareness are key for bin selection.

Feasibility, tight packing, and bin occupancy are key. Avoid log ratios and consider exponential rewards.
