Consider feasibility, packing tightness, wasted space penalty, and bin occupancy to improve heuristics.

Feasibility, tight packing, wasted space penalty, and occupancy preference improve bin selection.

Prioritize feasibility, then minimize wasted space, using exponential decay for finer control.

Prioritize feasibility, encourage tight packing with exponential rewards, and consider bin occupancy.

Feasibility, packing tightness, waste penalty, and existing occupancy are beneficial for online BPP heuristics.

Feasibility is key. Prioritize tight packing while penalizing wasted space exponentially.

Feasibility, wasted space, occupancy, and best-fit approximations improve bin selection significantly.

Feasibility check, tight packing, waste penalization, occupancy awareness, and best-fit approximation improve performance.

Prioritize feasibility, then encourage tight packing with exponential reward/penalty for wasted space.

Prioritize feasibility, tight packing, and bin occupancy for effective online bin packing heuristics.
