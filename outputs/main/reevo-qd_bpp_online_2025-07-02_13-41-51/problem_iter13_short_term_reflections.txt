Prioritize feasibility. Penalize wasted space, potentially exponentially, to encourage tight packing.

Feasibility is key. Reward tight packing and penalize wasted space for refinement.

Consider feasibility, packing tightness, waste minimization, and consolidating items for better BPP heuristics.

Feasibility, tight packing rewards, and wasted space penalties improve bin selection in online bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility. Encourage tight packing, and minimize wasted space for better bin utilization.

Feasibility, wasted space penalty, and bin utilization awareness improve online bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility checks, packing density rewards, waste penalization, and occupancy awareness improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility and tight packing are key. Explicitly reward fullness and penalize waste.

Feasibility checks, waste penalization, and best-fit approximation improve bin packing heuristics.

Consider feasibility, packing efficiency, wasted space penalty, and bin occupancy for better heuristics.
