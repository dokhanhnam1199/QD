Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics. Aim for actionable insights that avoid the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, factor combination, infeasibility penalties, experimental calibration, numerical stability, problem context.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently combine relevant factors using adaptive weighting schemes informed by data characteristics and problem context. Prioritize penalties for infeasibility.

*   **Avoid:** Simple implementations that overlook problem nuances, relying solely on penalties, ignoring potential rewards, skipping data-driven parameter tuning.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond basic implementations. Adaptive weighting, calibrated by experimentation and problem context, allows for better heuristic performance. Consider rewards, not *just* penalties.
