Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to build better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection".

Here's a revised approach focusing on robust, adaptable, and well-grounded heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, infeasibility penalties, factor combination, numerical stability, data-driven calibration.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by combining relevant factors with adaptive weights and appropriate functional forms. Focus on clear, well-defined objectives.
*   **Avoid:** Over-complication, excessive focus on edge cases at the expense of core performance, relying solely on intuition.
*   **Explanation:** Create heuristics that are both adaptable to the problem's characteristics and robust against numerical issues, grounding design choices in data and experimentation. Prioritize penalties over bonuses.
