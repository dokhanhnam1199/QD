**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates waste minimization, near-full bonuses, adaptive weighting based on capacity distribution, and a fill percentage score, whereas the worst only considers waste, near-full penalty, and capacity, with adaptive weighting based on total capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) reveals similar attributes. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), no code differences between the two. (3rd) vs (4th), the 4th introduces a larger infeasibility penalty, adjusts the near-full bonus with power, reduces capacity weight, sharpens the fill percentage peak, and adds a penalty for bins with very little remaining capacity. (second worst) vs (worst), little change in functionality. Overall: The better performing heuristics combine multiple factors (waste, near-fullness, capacity distribution, fill percentage) with carefully tuned weights and penalties, while the worse performing ones use fewer factors and simpler weighting schemes. The best heuristics also show refinement in handling infeasibility and edge cases.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors with carefully calibrated weights. Prioritize strong penalties for infeasible solutions and bonuses for desirable states. Adapt the weighting based on the specific problem context and input characteristics. Fine-tune the parameters through experimentation and data analysis.
