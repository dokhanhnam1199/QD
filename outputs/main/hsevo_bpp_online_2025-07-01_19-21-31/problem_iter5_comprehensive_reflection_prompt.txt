{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors using appropriate weights and functional forms. Ensure numerical stability using `epsilon`. Explicitly penalize infeasible solutions (e.g., bins too small for the item). Calibrate weights and penalties through experimentation or optimization.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize handling edge cases and avoid division by zero errors. Favour simpler implementations focusing on key factors like waste minimization and bin utilization. Also, use penalties rather than reward/bonus in heuristics.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
