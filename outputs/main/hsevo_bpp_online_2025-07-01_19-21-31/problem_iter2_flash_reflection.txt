**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic avoids division by zero errors and has a mechanism to discourage filling bins completely. The 20th heuristic, while considering waste minimization and future potential reward, lacks explicit handling of edge cases and complete filling.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), 2nd heuristic boosts priority when near full and adds ratio of item size, while 19th heuristic calculates waste penalty.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd heuristic uses a Newtonian "gravitational attraction" analogy, penalizing bins that are too full with negative infinity. The 4th heuristic gives a negative priority to almost full bins.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the 17th heuristic considers a balance between minimizing waste and future potential reward, incorporating an estimate of item size standard deviation, while 20th heuristic do the same as 17th heuristic.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the 1st heuristic avoid division by zero by adding a small value while 2nd heuristic avoid division by zero in another way by adding small value to denominator.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic 3 uses -np.inf to penalize, while heuristic 4 uses -1000 value.

Overall: The better heuristics appear to prioritize avoiding edge cases (division by zero), encourage fuller bins without completely filling them, consider waste minimization, and some mechanism to avoid extreme fragmentation. Simpler heuristics focusing on the core logic of fitting and waste performed better than complex analogies. Penalties for infeasible bins vary in magnitude, but large negative values are common. The better heuristics combined multiple factors, such as remaining capacity and waste, using weighted sums or other combination methods.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, prioritize handling edge cases and avoid division by zero errors. Favour simpler implementations focusing on key factors like waste minimization and bin utilization. Also, use penalties rather than reward/bonus in heuristics.
