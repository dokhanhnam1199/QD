Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more effective for designing heuristics, steering clear of pitfalls.

Here's a revised approach, focusing on a proactive and analytical mindset:

*   **Keywords:** Robustness, Simplicity, Penalties, Critical Analysis, Iterative Refinement.
*   **Advice:** Systematically test heuristic performance on diverse datasets, including edge cases. Analyze *why* failures occur. Prioritize ease of understanding and modification.
*   **Avoid:** Solely focusing on initial success. Blindly applying penalties without understanding their impact on overall solution quality. Premature optimization.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should be tested rigorously. Penalties help in exploration, but require careful calibration. Simple heuristics allow easier analysis. Iterative refinement is key to improvement.
