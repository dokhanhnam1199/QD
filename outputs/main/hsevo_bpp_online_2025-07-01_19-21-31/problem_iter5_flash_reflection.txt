**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines waste minimization with near-full bin penalties, while the worst simply prioritizes bins based on waste and penalizes near-full bins without considering how well the item fits initially. The best uses `1 / (waste + 0.0001)` as a priority score and adds penalties for nearly full bins, whereas the worst in the ranking uses `1.0 / (waste + 0.00001)` with a fixed penalty.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic calculates fit score and utilization score, combining them into a priority. The 19th only considers best fit, small space penalty, and waste. The second-best normalizes remaining capacity. The 19th penalizes bins that will have a small space remaining using `small_space_penalty = -10`.

Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the first uses hardcoded constant while the fifth uses hyper-optimized constants using waste epsilon, near full thresholds, near full penalty, and invalid bin priority.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), the 10th function uses best fit, capacity-based component and avoidance of near-full bins. The 11th uses fit score and fill percentage. Also, the 10th prioritizes larger remaining capacity using `capacity_priority = np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap) / (item + epsilon)`.

Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst heuristic `priorities[fit_mask] = (bins_remain_cap[fit_mask]**2) / (waste + 0.00001)` emphasizes the remaining capacity, while the worst only emphasizes wasted space.

Overall: Good heuristics often involve combining multiple factors (waste, fill level, near-full penalties) with carefully chosen weights or functional forms (e.g., exponential decay for waste). They use numerical stability (epsilon). A well-defined penalty is required for invalid bins.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors using appropriate weights and functional forms. Ensure numerical stability using `epsilon`. Explicitly penalize infeasible solutions (e.g., bins too small for the item). Calibrate weights and penalties through experimentation or optimization.
