Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design, focusing on constructive and effective practices, while avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, feasibility enforcement, experimental calibration, multi-factor integration.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to dynamically adjust weights based on problem state and feedback. Systematically explore the impact of different penalty magnitudes and functional forms on solution quality.

*   **Avoid:** Prematurely simplifying models. Solely focusing on error prevention without considering the impact of solution quality. Avoiding reward/bonus structures.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a balance of exploration (adaptive weighting) and exploitation (penalizing infeasibility). Rigorous experimentation is crucial for parameter tuning and ensuring robust performance.
