Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,\n                waste_epsilon: float = 0.00029754261408160114,\n                near_full_threshold1: float = 0.10542429393630628,\n                near_full_threshold2: float = 0.3707698105713286,\n                near_full_penalty1: float = -106.30093953587769,\n                near_full_penalty2_factor: float = -2.6672021331692797,\n                invalid_bin_priority: float = -869.4054121954937) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Combines waste minimization and near-full bin penalties.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        waste = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n        priorities[valid_bins] = 1 / (waste + waste_epsilon)\n\n        new_capacities = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n        near_full_penalty = np.zeros_like(new_capacities)\n\n        near_full_mask = new_capacities < near_full_threshold1\n        near_full_penalty[near_full_mask] = near_full_penalty1\n\n        near_full_mask2 = (new_capacities >= near_full_threshold1) & (new_capacities < near_full_threshold2)\n        near_full_penalty[near_full_mask2] = near_full_penalty2_factor * (near_full_threshold2 - new_capacities[near_full_mask2])**2\n        \n        priorities[valid_bins] += near_full_penalty\n\n    else:\n        priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, invalid_bin_priority)\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritizes bins, favoring those that fit the item well\n    and penalizing those where the item doesn't fit.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if np.any(fit_mask):\n        waste = bins_remain_cap[fit_mask] - item\n        priorities[fit_mask] = (bins_remain_cap[fit_mask]**2) / (waste + 0.00001)\n    else:\n        priorities = -np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines waste minimization with near-full bin penalties, while the worst simply prioritizes bins based on waste and penalizes near-full bins without considering how well the item fits initially. The best uses `1 / (waste + 0.0001)` as a priority score and adds penalties for nearly full bins, whereas the worst in the ranking uses `1.0 / (waste + 0.00001)` with a fixed penalty.\n\nComparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic calculates fit score and utilization score, combining them into a priority. The 19th only considers best fit, small space penalty, and waste. The second-best normalizes remaining capacity. The 19th penalizes bins that will have a small space remaining using `small_space_penalty = -10`.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (5th), the first uses hardcoded constant while the fifth uses hyper-optimized constants using waste epsilon, near full thresholds, near full penalty, and invalid bin priority.\n\nComparing (10th) vs (11th), the 10th function uses best fit, capacity-based component and avoidance of near-full bins. The 11th uses fit score and fill percentage. Also, the 10th prioritizes larger remaining capacity using `capacity_priority = np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap) / (item + epsilon)`.\n\nComparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst heuristic `priorities[fit_mask] = (bins_remain_cap[fit_mask]**2) / (waste + 0.00001)` emphasizes the remaining capacity, while the worst only emphasizes wasted space.\n\nOverall: Good heuristics often involve combining multiple factors (waste, fill level, near-full penalties) with carefully chosen weights or functional forms (e.g., exponential decay for waste). They use numerical stability (epsilon). A well-defined penalty is required for invalid bins.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on constructive and effective practices, while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, feasibility enforcement, experimental calibration, multi-factor integration.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to dynamically adjust weights based on problem state and feedback. Systematically explore the impact of different penalty magnitudes and functional forms on solution quality.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Prematurely simplifying models. Solely focusing on error prevention without considering the impact of solution quality. Avoiding reward/bonus structures.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a balance of exploration (adaptive weighting) and exploitation (penalizing infeasibility). Rigorous experimentation is crucial for parameter tuning and ensuring robust performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
