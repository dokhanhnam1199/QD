Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Employing Newtonian heuristics based on potential energy and a notion of\n    \"gravitational attraction\" between the item and the bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin (representing mass).\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin (representing distance).\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure no division by zero or negative values. Add a small epsilon for stability.\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n    effective_capacities = np.maximum(bins_remain_cap, epsilon)\n\n    # Newtonian \"gravitational attraction\" - Larger capacity, stronger attraction (higher priority).\n    # Also favor bins where the item fills a significant portion of the remaining space.\n    # A higher 'G' would signify our tendency towards packing fuller bins.\n\n    G = 1.0 # Gravitational constant - tune this based on desired packing density. Higher G encourages fuller bins\n    priority = G * (item / effective_capacities**2) * np.exp(-np.abs(item - effective_capacities)) # attraction is proportional to 1/(distance)^2 multiplied with exponentially reducing difference\n\n    # Penalize bins that are too full (not enough space for the item) using a large negative value.\n    priority[bins_remain_cap < item] = -np.inf\n\n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines waste minimization with a near-full boost, avoids edge cases.\"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    remaining_after_add = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Assign low priority to bins that cannot fit the item.\n    priorities = np.where(remaining_after_add >= 0, 0.0, -1000.0)\n\n    # Waste penalty based on remaining capacity.\n    waste_penalty = -np.abs(remaining_after_add)\n\n    # Near-full boost.\n    near_full_bonus = np.where((bins_remain_cap > item) & (bins_remain_cap <= 2 * item), item / bins_remain_cap * 10, 0)\n\n    # Combine waste and boost.\n    priorities = np.where(remaining_after_add >= 0, waste_penalty + near_full_bonus, priorities)\n    \n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines waste minimization with near-full bin penalties, while the worst simply prioritizes bins based on waste and penalizes near-full bins without considering how well the item fits initially. The best uses `1 / (waste + 0.0001)` as a priority score and adds penalties for nearly full bins, whereas the worst in the ranking uses `1.0 / (waste + 0.00001)` with a fixed penalty.\n\nComparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic calculates fit score and utilization score, combining them into a priority. The 19th only considers best fit, small space penalty, and waste. The second-best normalizes remaining capacity. The 19th penalizes bins that will have a small space remaining using `small_space_penalty = -10`.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (5th), the first uses hardcoded constant while the fifth uses hyper-optimized constants using waste epsilon, near full thresholds, near full penalty, and invalid bin priority.\n\nComparing (10th) vs (11th), the 10th function uses best fit, capacity-based component and avoidance of near-full bins. The 11th uses fit score and fill percentage. Also, the 10th prioritizes larger remaining capacity using `capacity_priority = np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap) / (item + epsilon)`.\n\nComparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst heuristic `priorities[fit_mask] = (bins_remain_cap[fit_mask]**2) / (waste + 0.00001)` emphasizes the remaining capacity, while the worst only emphasizes wasted space.\n\nOverall: Good heuristics often involve combining multiple factors (waste, fill level, near-full penalties) with carefully chosen weights or functional forms (e.g., exponential decay for waste). They use numerical stability (epsilon). A well-defined penalty is required for invalid bins.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on constructive and effective practices, while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, feasibility enforcement, experimental calibration, multi-factor integration.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to dynamically adjust weights based on problem state and feedback. Systematically explore the impact of different penalty magnitudes and functional forms on solution quality.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Prematurely simplifying models. Solely focusing on error prevention without considering the impact of solution quality. Avoiding reward/bonus structures.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a balance of exploration (adaptive weighting) and exploitation (penalizing infeasibility). Rigorous experimentation is crucial for parameter tuning and ensuring robust performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
