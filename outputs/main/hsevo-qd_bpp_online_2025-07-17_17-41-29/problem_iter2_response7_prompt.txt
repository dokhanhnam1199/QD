Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    Prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item with minimal waste,\n    but also avoids filling bins completely to allow for flexibility with\n    future, potentially smaller, items.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a combination of factors like fit, remaining space after placement, penalties for overfill or near-empty bins, and randomness to explore diverse solutions. Less effective heuristics rely solely on simple ratios. Good heuristics include clear penalization strategies.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices and incorporating a more robust approach.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative Refinement, Outcome Analysis, Adaptive Parameters, Exploration-Exploitation Balance.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic outcomes. Adapt parameters based on performance metrics. Employ diverse search strategies balancing exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, rigidity in parameter settings, neglecting outcome analysis, relying solely on intuition.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple combinations to actively learn from results, dynamically adjust heuristic behavior, and prevent getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
