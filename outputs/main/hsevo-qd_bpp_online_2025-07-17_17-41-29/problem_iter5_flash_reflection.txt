**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic considers feasibility, best fit, avoidance of very small spaces, utilizes almost full bins and introduces a balancing term. The last heuristic only considers a ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity using logarithms.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second heuristic considers feasibility, best fit, avoidance of very small spaces by applying penalty and utilizes almost full bins by giving a reward. The 19th heuristic, similar to the 20th only considers a ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity using logarithms.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first heuristic introduces a balancing term to penalize filling up the fullest bins when there are more available options.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these two heuristics are identical, indicating they perform similarly. This suggests that just including the core logic of feasibility, best fit, small space avoidance, and utilizing almost full bins is a good starting point.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst introduces a variety of parameters for tuning, this seems to suggest a basic version and an advanced version. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors beyond just a simple ratio. They factor in feasibility, aim for best fit, avoid creating tiny remaining spaces, and prefer filling bins that are nearly full. Some also incorporate balancing to prevent premature filling of certain bins.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with core components like feasibility and best fit. Then, iteratively add refinements such as avoiding small spaces and utilizing almost full bins. Consider a final balancing step to improve overall distribution of items across bins. Also, parameterize for tunability.
