Okay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focused on actionable steps and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, multi-objective balance, parameterized tunability, constraint satisfaction.

*   **Advice:** Build a heuristic incrementally. Start with feasibility, then optimize for secondary objectives, and finally balance competing concerns.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single metrics, premature optimization, and inflexible, hard-coded logic.

*   **Explanation:** A strong heuristic is rarely built in one go. Begin with essential components (feasibility), layer in improvements (efficiency, balance), and allow for fine-tuning via parameters to adapt to different problem instances.
