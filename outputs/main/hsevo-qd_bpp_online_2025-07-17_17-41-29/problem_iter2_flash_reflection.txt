**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a weighted sum of several factors including fitability, nearly full priority, overfill penalty, and randomness while the worst only uses log ratios of item size to remaining capacity; (2nd) vs (19th) shows a similar difference in complexity and consideration of factors; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the top heuristic uses a combination of fitting score, preference for nearly full bins after placement, and overfill penalty; (3rd) vs (4th) highlights how softmax is used to prioritize bins with tighter fits while the fourth focuses on remaining space, penalizing unused capacity; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see similar implementations that only focus on ratios of item size to remaining capacity and use logarithms. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a combination of factors like fit, remaining space after placement, penalties for overfill or near-empty bins, and randomness to explore diverse solutions. Less effective heuristics rely solely on simple ratios. Good heuristics include clear penalization strategies.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors with appropriate weighting and penalize undesirable outcomes (e.g., overfilling). Experiment with different combinations, normalizations, and explore randomness to improve robustness and avoid local optima.
