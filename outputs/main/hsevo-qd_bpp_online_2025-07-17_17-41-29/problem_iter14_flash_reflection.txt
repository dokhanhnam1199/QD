**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic implements a detailed priority system, incorporating feasibility, best fit, avoidance of small spaces, and utilization of almost full bins, while the last one only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity using a log scale. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the second-best heuristic attempts to combines best-fit, avoidance of small spaces, and balancing through small adjustments to priorities with an emphasis on leaving enough room, while second worst still focuses on item/bin ratio, without consideration for leaving enough room.. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) emphasizes thresholds based on absolute remaining space, while (2nd) uses thresholds based on *ratio* of remaining space which may be better since it is more scalable.. (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that second-worst to worst has the same functionality, which means there may not have been much difference between the two codes during the test. Overall: The better heuristics involve multiple factors, including feasibility, best fit, avoidance of creating extremely small spaces, and rewarding nearly full bins. The worse heuristics focus primarily on a single factor, such as the ratio between item size and remaining capacity, or have redundant code. Additionally, more successful heuristics often include tunable parameters (thresholds, penalties, rewards) and small adjustments to the priority scores.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors. Prioritize feasibility and then focus on best fit and avoiding fragmentation. Add small rewards or penalties to guide the algorithm towards better solutions. Make sure the hyperparameter is scalable with ratio instead of hard-coded value.
