**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of feasibility, best fit, avoidance of very small spaces, utilization of almost full bins, and a balancing term, while the worst only uses the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity and its logarithm.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), 4th and 19th, we see the second-best heuristic introduces thresholds and penalties/rewards based on remaining space, whereas the second worst just uses log ratios. The 4th introduces tunable parameters.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are functionally identical. This suggests the ranking might be due to external factors or subtle differences not apparent in the code itself.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 4th introduces parameters and modifies the avoidance of small spaces by adding `(np.sum(bins_remain_cap[feasible_mask] -item >small_space_threshold) > 0)` condition which checks if there is at least one other bin with larger space.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the difference lies primarily in the lack of explicit feasibility checks and best-fit prioritization in the very worst heuristics. They depend entirely on a log ratio which may not effectively capture bin filling dynamics.
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), 5th includes avoidance of very small space like 4th, and adds almost full bins like 1st, 2nd, 3rd. 6th only focuses on feasibility, best fit, and balancing term.
Comparing (7th) vs (8th), they're duplicates, this is likely a mistake.
Comparing (8th) vs (9th), is like 1st vs 5th, 9th has avoidance of very small space like 4th, and adds almost full bins like 1st, 2nd, 3rd. 8th included all components.
Comparing (10th) vs (11th), 10th combines fitability score, nearly-full priority, overfill penalty, and best-fit logic.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors, including feasibility, best fit, avoidance of small spaces, and encouragement of filling bins completely. Tunable parameters appear beneficial. Simpler heuristics relying on single metrics (like log ratios) perform poorly. Penalizing the fullest bins can help to avoid premature convergence.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and combine them thoughtfully. Incorporate tunable parameters for flexibility. Don't rely on single metrics. Penalizing strategies and feasibility are helpful.
