**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates feasibility, best fit, avoidance of small spaces, utilization of almost full bins, and a balancing term, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity using a logarithmic scale. (2nd) introduces the idea of fitability score, nearly-full priority, overfill penalty, and best-fit component.
(1st) vs (6th): They are identical.
(2nd) vs (3rd): They are identical.
(4th) vs (5th): They are identical.
(11th) vs (20th): They are identical.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best heuristic uses a rule-based approach with specific thresholds and penalties/rewards for different scenarios, while the second best uses a weighted combination of continuous scores (fitability, nearly-full priority, etc.). The first one is more explicit and interpretable.
Comparing (4th) vs (8th), the main difference lies in the use of parameters in (4th) versus hardcoded values in (8th). This makes (4th) more flexible but also requires tuning. (4th) also includes a condition to only apply the small space penalty when more fits are feasible.
Comparing (2nd) vs (4th), (2nd) uses a combination of continuous scores and weights, while (4th) uses thresholds and penalties/rewards.

Overall: The better heuristics involve multiple factors and potentially non-linear combinations or conditional application of rules. Simpler heuristics relying solely on ratios are less effective. Introducing tunable parameters improves flexibility. The best heuristics appear to balance exploration and exploitation by discouraging leaving very small spaces and rewarding filling bins almost completely.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors using conditional logic and tunable parameters. Penalize undesirable outcomes and reward beneficial ones to achieve a good balance. Avoid over-simplicity, as it can lead to suboptimal solutions.
