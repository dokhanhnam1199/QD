Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, actively avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, iterative refinement, tunable parameters, balancing.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics incrementally. Start with feasibility, add best fit, and then progressively refine (e.g., avoiding fragmentation). Balance the final solution distribution.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single metrics or hard-coded values. Generic "experiment with combinations" advice without a clear strategy.
*   **Explanation:** This approach focuses on a structured design process, emphasizing iterative improvement and careful tuning, rather than vague experimentation. Balance ensures a holistic view of the problem.
