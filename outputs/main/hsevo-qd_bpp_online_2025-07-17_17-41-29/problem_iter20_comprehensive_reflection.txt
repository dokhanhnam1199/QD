Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls. Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative Refinement, Multi-Criteria, Tunability, Contextual Awareness.
*   **Advice:** Start with core constraints (feasibility) and gradually add secondary objectives (fit, balance). Design for iterative improvement with tunable parameters.
*   **Avoid:** Over-simplification, premature optimization, rigid weights (adapt to context).
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a flexible framework. Start simple, test thoroughly, and refine based on performance. Make parameters tunable and aware of context.
