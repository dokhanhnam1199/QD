Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate waste if the item is placed in the bin\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Give high priority to bins where the item fits and waste is minimized\n    for i, w in enumerate(waste):\n        if w >= 0:\n            priorities[i] = 1 / (w + 0.00001)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero\n\n    # Penalize bins where the item doesn't fit heavily\n    priorities[bins_remain_cap < item] = -1000  # or some other large negative number\n\n    #Boost the bins which has higher capacity closer to item size\n    cap_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap-item)\n    priorities = priorities - cap_diff/ np.max(bins_remain_cap)\n\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    # First, prioritize bins that can actually fit the item.\n    fit_indices = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0]\n    \n    if len(fit_indices) > 0:\n        # Among the bins that can fit, prioritize those with the smallest remaining capacity\n        # after placing the item (i.e., minimize wasted space).

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a combination of factors like fit, remaining space after placement, penalties for overfill or near-empty bins, and randomness to explore diverse solutions. Less effective heuristics rely solely on simple ratios. Good heuristics include clear penalization strategies.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices and incorporating a more robust approach.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative Refinement, Outcome Analysis, Adaptive Parameters, Exploration-Exploitation Balance.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic outcomes. Adapt parameters based on performance metrics. Employ diverse search strategies balancing exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, rigidity in parameter settings, neglecting outcome analysis, relying solely on intuition.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple combinations to actively learn from results, dynamically adjust heuristic behavior, and prevent getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
