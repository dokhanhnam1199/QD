{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors (feasibility, best fit, fragmentation, balance). Assign weights based on importance, and fine-tune them. Avoid over-simplicity, and introduce randomness/contextual penalties cautiously.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors with appropriate weighting and penalize undesirable outcomes (e.g., overfilling). Experiment with different combinations, normalizations, and explore randomness to improve robustness and avoid local optima.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, start with core components like feasibility and best fit. Then, iteratively add refinements such as avoiding small spaces and utilizing almost full bins. Consider a final balancing step to improve overall distribution of items across bins. Also, parameterize for tunability.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and combine them thoughtfully. Incorporate tunable parameters for flexibility. Don't rely on single metrics. Penalizing strategies and feasibility are helpful.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors using conditional logic and tunable parameters. Penalize undesirable outcomes and reward beneficial ones to achieve a good balance. Avoid over-simplicity, as it can lead to suboptimal solutions.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors. Prioritize feasibility and then focus on best fit and avoiding fragmentation. Add small rewards or penalties to guide the algorithm towards better solutions. Make sure the hyperparameter is scalable with ratio instead of hard-coded value.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interplay. Start with essential constraints (feasibility) and then incorporate secondary objectives (best fit, balancing). Introduce tunable parameters and consider randomness to fine-tune performance and avoid local optima.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
