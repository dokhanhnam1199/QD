Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focusing on actionable insights for heuristic design, while avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, modularity, parameterized balancing, feasibility-first.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics in stages, starting with a feasible solution and then adding layers of improvement. Focus on creating modular components (e.g., a feasibility checker, a bin selection module, a balancing module) that can be adjusted and combined. Parameterize the balancing stage to fine-tune the trade-offs between different objectives.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity. Resist the urge to combine everything at once.
*   **Explanation:** A staged, modular approach allows for easier debugging, testing, and adaptation of the heuristic. Parameterized balancing provides flexibility to prioritize different performance aspects. Starting with feasibility ensures a solid foundation.
