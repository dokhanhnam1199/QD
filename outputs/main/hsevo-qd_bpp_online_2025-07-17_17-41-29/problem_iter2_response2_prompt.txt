Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize priorities with a small default value to avoid division by zero and negative infinity issues.\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float) - 1e9 # Large negative value makes them very low priority by default.\n    \n    # Identify bins where the item can fit\n    fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # Prioritize bins with tighter fits (minimize wasted space). Use a softmax approach for this.\n    # The idea is to assign higher priority to bins whose remaining capacity after placement will be small.\n    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item\n    remaining_space[~fit_mask] = np.inf # Make invalid spaces effectively infinitely large for softmax calculation\n\n    # Apply softmax after subtracting the minimum from remaining_space, which adds stability\n    remaining_space_shifted = remaining_space - np.min(remaining_space[fit_mask]) if np.any(fit_mask) else remaining_space\n    priorities[fit_mask] = np.exp(-remaining_space_shifted[fit_mask]) / np.sum(np.exp(-remaining_space_shifted[fit_mask])) if np.any(fit_mask) else 0.\n\n    # Boost the priority of bins that are nearly full to try and complete them, provided the item fits\n    nearly_full_threshold = 0.1  # e.g., Bin is considered nearly full if remaining capacity is less than 10% of item size\n    nearly_full_bins = (bins_remain_cap <= item * (1 + nearly_full_threshold)) & fit_mask\n\n    priorities[nearly_full_bins] += 1.0  # Add a boost to priority of nearly full bins\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    ratios = item / bins_remain_cap\n    log_ratios = np.log(ratios)\n    priorities = -log_ratios\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a weighted sum of several factors including fitability, nearly full priority, overfill penalty, and randomness while the worst only uses log ratios of item size to remaining capacity; (2nd) vs (19th) shows a similar difference in complexity and consideration of factors; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the top heuristic uses a combination of fitting score, preference for nearly full bins after placement, and overfill penalty; (3rd) vs (4th) highlights how softmax is used to prioritize bins with tighter fits while the fourth focuses on remaining space, penalizing unused capacity; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see similar implementations that only focus on ratios of item size to remaining capacity and use logarithms. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a combination of factors like fit, remaining space after placement, penalties for overfill or near-empty bins, and randomness to explore diverse solutions. Less effective heuristics rely solely on simple ratios. Good heuristics include clear penalization strategies.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices and incorporating a more robust approach.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative Refinement, Outcome Analysis, Adaptive Parameters, Exploration-Exploitation Balance.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic outcomes. Adapt parameters based on performance metrics. Employ diverse search strategies balancing exploration and exploitation.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, rigidity in parameter settings, neglecting outcome analysis, relying solely on intuition.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple combinations to actively learn from results, dynamically adjust heuristic behavior, and prevent getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
