Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding ineffective practices and incorporating a more robust approach.

*   **Keywords:** Iterative Refinement, Outcome Analysis, Adaptive Parameters, Exploration-Exploitation Balance.
*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic outcomes. Adapt parameters based on performance metrics. Employ diverse search strategies balancing exploration and exploitation.
*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, rigidity in parameter settings, neglecting outcome analysis, relying solely on intuition.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple combinations to actively learn from results, dynamically adjust heuristic behavior, and prevent getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.
