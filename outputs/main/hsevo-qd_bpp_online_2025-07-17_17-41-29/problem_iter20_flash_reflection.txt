**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates best-fit, avoidance of small spaces, and balancing, while the worst uses only the ratio of item size to remaining capacity.
(2nd best) vs (2nd worst), the former incorporates multiple factors like best fit, avoidance of small spaces, utilizing almost full bins, balancing bin usage, and item size consideration, compared to just log ratios in the latter.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first heuristic uses simple avoidance of leaving very small spaces and target full bins while the second heuristic explicitly calculate penalty, but both incorporates best fit and feasibility. The second one incorporates balance and item size.
(3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic focuses on the fill ratio and fragmentation avoidance, while the fourth uses best fit, avoidance of small spaces, utilizing almost full bins, prioritizing bins close to item size, and randomness.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both only consider the ratio, but one of them use log and subtract them.
Overall: Better heuristics involve multiple factors with carefully tuned weights, address feasibility, best fit, fragmentation avoidance, and bin balancing. Simpler heuristics relying solely on ratios or a single factor tend to perform worse. Introducing small degrees of randomness or specific penalties based on context can be helpful but requires careful consideration.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors (feasibility, best fit, fragmentation, balance). Assign weights based on importance, and fine-tune them. Avoid over-simplicity, and introduce randomness/contextual penalties cautiously.
