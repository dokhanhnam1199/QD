Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice while avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection." Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, Best Fit, Iterative Refinement, Tunable Parameters, Multi-Factor Combination, Scalability, Penalties/Rewards.

*   **Advice:** Start with feasibility and best fit as core elements. Iteratively refine by adding secondary considerations (fragmentation, balancing). Implement tunable parameters for adaptable performance.

*   **Avoid:** Over-simplicity, relying solely on single metrics, hard-coded hyperparameters, and lack of conditional logic.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design involves building upon a solid foundation (feasibility) and progressively adding complexity through a weighted combination of factors. Tunable parameters and conditional logic are crucial for adapting to different problem instances and avoiding local optima. Use rewards and penalties to guide solution-finding toward better balance and performance. Avoid overly simplistic approaches that may not capture the intricacies of the problem and ensure hyperparameters scale proportionally to input data.
