{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with core components like feasibility and best fit. Then, iteratively add refinements such as avoiding small spaces and utilizing almost full bins. Consider a final balancing step to improve overall distribution of items across bins. Also, parameterize for tunability.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors with appropriate weighting and penalize undesirable outcomes (e.g., overfilling). Experiment with different combinations, normalizations, and explore randomness to improve robustness and avoid local optima.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
