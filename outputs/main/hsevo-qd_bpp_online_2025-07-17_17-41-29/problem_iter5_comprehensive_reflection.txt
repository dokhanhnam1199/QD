Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Principles, Evaluation, Adaptation, Simplification.
*   **Advice:** Focus on fundamental principles first. Rigorously evaluate each added refinement's impact. Adapt the heuristic based on performance feedback. Aim for simplicity to avoid overfitting.
*   **Avoid:** Arbitrary complexity, premature optimization, neglecting edge cases.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a clear understanding of the problem, create a simple initial heuristic based on core principles, and then iteratively improve it by focusing on specific shortcomings identified through careful evaluation.
