Prioritize feasibility, best fit, and fragmentation control. Add bonuses for near-full bins to improve packing density.

The better code uses a combination of best-fit, fragmentation avoidance, and nearly-full bin incentives with exponential scaling.

Prioritize tighter fills, penalize large remaining space, and heavily reward near-full bins. Use vectorized operations.

Prioritize fullness, penalize fragmentation, and ensure feasibility first. Magnitude of rewards/penalties matter.

The better code uses normalized, proportional priorities, encouraging full packing and penalizing overflow relative to bin capacity.

Prioritize minimal wasted space and utilization. Penalize empty-ish bins and invalid moves harshly.

The better code prioritizes tight fits and avoids fragmenting bins, while the worse code inadequately differentiates bin choices.

The better code prioritizes filling bins, penalizes exceeding capacity, and avoids scaling issues.

Focus on feasibility first. Then, balance packing density with avoiding small, unusable gaps.

Focus on efficiently minimizing waste and rewarding good fill ratios while penalizing infeasible bins.
