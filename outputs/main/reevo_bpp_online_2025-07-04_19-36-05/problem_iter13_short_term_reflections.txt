Additive combination, item-relative scaling, and considering existing fill levels improved performance. Load balancing helps.

Key improvements: item-relative scaling, additive combination, load balancing, and direct bonuses improve performance.

Item-relative scaling, direct bonuses, and load balancing significantly improve bin packing heuristics.

The better code uses simpler exponential functions, explicit item-size scaling, and additive combination with weights.

*   **Normalization:** Normalize features with respect to `bin_size`.
*   **Penalty Strength:** Adjust penalty/reward strength for better balance.
*   **Clipping:** Clip fragmentation penalty to avoid extreme values.

Item-relative scaling, additive combination, load balancing, and direct bonuses improved bin packing.

Focus on direct residual capacity, avoid scaling by item size, and combine criteria multiplicatively.

The better code uses simpler, scaled features and adds item-size scaling and infeasibility penalties.

Explore simpler, additive combinations and consider direct scaling and ratio-based features. Also, avoid zero values.

The better code uses simpler functions, direct residual capacity measures, and adds priorities instead of multiplying.
