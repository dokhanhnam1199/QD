Prioritize feasibility, reward fullness, penalize fragmentation aggressively, and add near-full bin bonuses.

The better code uses fragmentation penalty, exponential decay and almost-full bin bonuses for improved packing.

The better code uses clearer prioritization for fitting and non-fitting bins, focusing on minimizing waste and fragmentation.

Prioritize feasibility, reward fullness non-linearly, penalize fragmentation aggressively, and bonus near-full bins.

When item fits, prioritize tight fit and fullness. If item doesn't fit, prefer bins with less remaining capacity.

Explicitly penalizing small gaps and using normalized remaining space improved performance.

Explicitly handle infeasibility, normalize remaining space, and penalize small gaps to improve packing density.

Prioritize feasibility and bin utilization. Explicitly discourage overfilling. Explore non-linear priority scaling.

Prioritize feasibility, directly reward near-full bins, and use simpler, more direct priority calculations.

Prioritize fitting; use relative remaining capacity. Penalize overflow proportionally to average bin size.
