The better code uses item-relative scaling, sharper best-fit prioritization, and weighted priority combinations.

The better code prioritizes item-relative scaling, sharp rewards/penalties, and weighted combinations of heuristics.

Sharper best-fit, no normalization, direct fill-level bonus, and stronger item-fit scoring improves performance.

Prioritize best-fit, fragmentation avoidance, and filling existing bins relative to item size. Use multiplicative combinations.

1. Explicitly penalize infeasible bins.
2. Scale penalties/bonuses by bin/item size.
3. Prioritize existing fill levels.

Focus on scaling penalties/rewards with item size and bin capacity; cubic fragmentation penalty is effective.

Scaling residual capacity by item size and bin size improves performance. Avoid over-emphasizing specific criteria.

The better code uses exponential functions for nuanced rewards/penalties, focusing on best fit and relative item size.

Prioritize best fit, fragmentation, and capacity utilization. Scale rewards/penalties appropriately with bin size.

Focus on best-fit, fragmentation avoidance (cubic penalty scaled by item size), and rewarding existing fill levels.
