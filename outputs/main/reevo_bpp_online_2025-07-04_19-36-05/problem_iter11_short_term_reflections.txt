Additive combination, direct rewards, and item-relative scaling improve bin packing heuristic performance.

Explicit weighting, bin-relative scaling, and direct near-full rewards improve heuristic performance.

Prioritize feasibility with large penalties. Use multiplicative combinations and item-relative scaling for better performance.

Prioritize best fit, control fragmentation, and directly reward near-full bins after placement.

Prioritize best-fit directly, encourage existing bin fill, and consider item-relative waste for better performance.

Better code:
1. Uses explicit infeasibility penalty.
2. Scales rewards/penalties with item size for better generalization.
3. Cubes fragmentation penalty.

Scale by item size, prioritize near-full bins, and use fill level as a reward.

Learned weights, bin-relative scaling, direct rewards, and strong fragmentation penalties improve online bin packing.

Scaling by item size, emphasizing filling, and tuning weights improved the priority function.

Focus on balancing exploration/exploitation, scaling residual capacity appropriately, and handling infeasibility gracefully.
