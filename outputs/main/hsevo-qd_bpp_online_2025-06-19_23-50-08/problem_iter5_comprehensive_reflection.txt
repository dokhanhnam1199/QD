Here's a refined view of self-reflection for designing better heuristics, steering clear of ineffective pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-objective, penalty, ablation, infeasibility, reward shaping, performance factors.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a comprehensive multi-objective function capturing key performance drivers. Prioritize penalizing detrimental behaviors (e.g., infeasible solutions) with carefully crafted negative rewards.

*   **Avoid:** Premature feature reduction. Focus on a broad initial feature set before ablation.

*   **Explanation:** Systematically penalizing poor choices provides stronger guidance signal than solely rewarding positive ones. Ablation reveals feature importance after initial design.
