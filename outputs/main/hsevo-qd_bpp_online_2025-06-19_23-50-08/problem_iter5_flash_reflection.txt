**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first uses a fill ratio, a waste penalty, and a bonus for remaining capacity close to the average item size, while the last only uses the inverse log of the fill ratio. (2nd) vs (19th) shows the same pattern. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (13rd) vs (18th), (13rd) prioritizes based on fit, fill ratio, and waste, strongly penalizing infeasible placements. (18th) just uses the negative log of the fill ratio. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors like fill rate, waste, and remaining capacity, while simpler heuristics only use fill rate. The best ones also include ways to prevent making small waste.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors that impact performance and make sure to penalize bad behaviour. Start with a multi-objective function, then prune features based on ablation testing. Carefully design reward/penalty functions.
