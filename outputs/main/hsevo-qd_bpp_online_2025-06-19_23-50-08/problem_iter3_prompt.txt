Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritizes bins considering fill rate, waste, and infeasibility.\"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    fit = item <= bins_remain_cap\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    priorities[~fit] = -np.inf  # Impossible to fit\n\n    # Fill ratio + waste penalty, adjusted penalty strength for finer control.\n    priorities[fit] = (item / bins_remain_cap[fit]) + np.exp(-waste[waste >= 0] * 5)\n\n    # Refinement: slight bonus for bins that will have remaining capacity close to the average item size.\n    avg_item_size = np.mean(item)  # Average item for online setting\n    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap[fit] - item\n    priorities[fit] += np.exp(-np.abs(remaining_after_fit - avg_item_size) * 2) # Add bonus\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better bin packing heuristics, avoiding ineffective practices:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Fill rate, waste minimization, infeasibility penalty, negative rewards, scoring assignments, heuristic adaptation.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on immediate consequences of placement decisions *and* their impact on future placement opportunities. Prioritize minimizing future waste by optimizing the \"shape\" of remaining space in bins.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly scoring potential assignments based solely on immediate fill; overlooking the cascading effect on later placements and overall waste.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to be forward-looking, recognizing that seemingly good placements now can limit future options and increase overall waste or infeasibility.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
