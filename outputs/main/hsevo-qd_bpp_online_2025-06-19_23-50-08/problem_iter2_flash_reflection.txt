**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic prioritizes bins based on both fill rate and wasted space, penalizing bins that can't fit the item and incentivizing near-perfect fills. The worst heuristic only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity using logarithms and doesn't explicitly penalize bins that can't fit the item. Comparing (11th) vs (20th), both use log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the best uses a fill ratio `item / bins_remain_cap` and penalizes waste `np.exp(-waste[waste >= 0] * 10)`, while the 11th uses the negative log of the fill ratio. All heuristics from 1st to 10th are exactly the same.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for bin packing should consider both the fill rate and the remaining waste, and crucially, must penalize infeasible assignments. Incorporating negative rewards for bad choices proves more useful than simply scoring potential assignments.
