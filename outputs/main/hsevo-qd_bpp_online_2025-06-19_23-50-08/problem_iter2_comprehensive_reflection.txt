Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for designing better bin packing heuristics, avoiding ineffective practices:

*   **Keywords:** Fill rate, waste minimization, infeasibility penalty, negative rewards, scoring assignments, heuristic adaptation.

*   **Advice:** Focus on immediate consequences of placement decisions *and* their impact on future placement opportunities. Prioritize minimizing future waste by optimizing the "shape" of remaining space in bins.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly scoring potential assignments based solely on immediate fill; overlooking the cascading effect on later placements and overall waste.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics need to be forward-looking, recognizing that seemingly good placements now can limit future options and increase overall waste or infeasibility.
