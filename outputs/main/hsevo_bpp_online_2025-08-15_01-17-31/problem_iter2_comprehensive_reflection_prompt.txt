{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize heuristics that directly minimize wasted space (e.g., inverse of remaining gap) for \"best fit\". Sigmoid/softmax can offer nuanced control but requires careful parameter tuning. Explicitly handle non-fitting bins with very low priorities (e.g., `-inf`). Vectorized operations are generally preferred over loops for performance.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
