        # This encourages tighter packing.
        # We can transform the gaps to create a descending priority,
        # so smaller gaps get higher priorities.
        # A simple way is to invert the gaps (1/gap) but this can lead to division by zero
        # or very large numbers if gap is close to zero.
        # A more robust approach is to use a function that maps smaller gaps to higher values.
        # For instance, exp(-gap) or similar, but let's stick to something simpler
        # and directly related to "best fit".
        
        # We want the smallest non-negative gap to have the highest priority.
        # The priority can be inverse of (gap + epsilon) to avoid division by zero,
        # or simply a large number for the best fit and decreasing for others.
        
        # Let's consider a priority that is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity
        # AFTER placing the item. The bin that results in the SMALLEST remaining capacity
        # (closest to zero) is the "best fit".
        
        # Priority = 1 / (remaining_capacity_after_fit + 1e-9)
        # Or, to make it simpler and avoid potential overflow with very small gaps:
        # Priority = -gap, so smaller gaps have larger (less negative) priorities.
        # But we need to distinguish between different fits.
        
        # A common approach for "best fit" is to assign a high priority to the bin
        # where (bin_capacity - item) is minimized.
        # Let's create a priority that is higher for smaller (bin_capacity - item).
        
        # We can simply use the negative of the gap, and then take the reciprocal
        # to boost smaller gaps significantly.
        # If gap = 0.1, 1/0.1 = 10. If gap = 0.01, 1/0.01 = 100.
        # If gap = 1, 1/1 = 1. This seems to work.
        
        # Let's ensure a positive priority for fitting bins.
        # We can use a large base priority and subtract a penalty for larger gaps.
        # Or, let's directly map smallest gap to highest priority.
        
        # Priority = -(gap)
        # If we have gaps [0.1, 0.5, 0.05], priorities are [-0.1, -0.5, -0.05].
        # The bin with gap 0.05 is the best fit, but it has the lowest priority (-0.05 is larger than -0.1 and -0.5).
        # So we need to invert this.
        
        # Option 1: Using a penalty for gap
        # highest_priority_value = 1.0
        # penalty_per_unit_gap = 0.1
        # priorities[can_fit_mask] = highest_priority_value - (gaps * penalty_per_unit_gap)
        
        # Option 2: Directly use the reciprocal of gap (plus a small constant to avoid zero division)
        # This gives higher scores to smaller gaps.
        epsilon = 1e-9
        priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (gaps + epsilon)
        
        # Option 3: Maximize the remaining capacity if it's the best fit, otherwise minimize.
        # This is more "first fit" like.
        
        # Let's refine Option 2 to ensure clear ranking.
        # A slightly different approach: assign priority such that smaller gaps get HIGHER scores.
        # This could be by transforming `gaps` into a decreasing sequence of priorities.
        # Example: For gaps [0.1, 0.5, 0.05], we want scores like [high, medium, very_high].
        # The reciprocal of the gap provides this.
        
        # Let's make it even more aligned with "best fit" as minimizing waste.
        # The priority of a bin could be seen as how "tight" the fit is.
        # A tighter fit means the remaining capacity is smaller.
        # We want to maximize the score for the tightest fit.
        
        # So, for bins that fit, the priority can be -gap.
        # Then, we want to pick the bin with the MINIMUM gap.
        # So, the priority should be something that INCREASES as gap DECREASES.
        # The score should be inversely proportional to the gap.
        
        # Let's try to map gaps to a scoring system:
        # Gap: 0.01  -> Score: 100
        # Gap: 0.1   -> Score: 10
        # Gap: 0.5   -> Score: 2
        # This suggests a score that is roughly 1/gap.
        
        # The previous choice of 1.0 / (gaps + epsilon) works.
        # However, it might give very large scores to tiny gaps.
        # Let's make it more linear or bounded.
        
        # A simpler approach: subtract the gap from a large constant.
        # The bin with the smallest gap will have the largest score.
        # Let M be a sufficiently large number. Priority = M - gap.
        # If M=100, gaps [0.1, 0.5, 0.05] -> scores [99.9, 99.5, 99.95].
        # This works well. The smallest gap has the largest priority.
        
        # Let's choose a large constant. The range of remaining capacities might influence this.
        # If bin capacity is 1 and item size is 0.1, gaps can be up to ~0.9.
        # A constant like 1.0 should be sufficient if we normalize or scale the gaps.
        
        # Let's try to create a priority score such that the BEST FIT bin
        # gets the HIGHEST score.
        # The "best fit" is the bin with the smallest `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        
        # So, we want a function f(gap) such that f(gap1) > f(gap2) if gap1 < gap2.
        # A simple choice is `f(gap) = -gap`. This means smaller gaps have higher priorities.
        # Let's add an offset to ensure positive priorities or a baseline.
        # Priority = C - gap.
        
        # The actual values of priorities don't matter as much as their relative order.
        # The primary goal of best fit is to minimize the leftover space in the chosen bin.
        # So, the bins that leave the least space are preferred.
        
        # Let's define priority as inversely proportional to the capacity *after* filling the item.
        # So, priority = 1 / (remaining_capacity_after_fill).
        # This will maximize the score for the bin that has the smallest remaining capacity after filling.
        # This is the definition of best fit.
        
        remaining_capacity_after_fill = bins_that_can_fit - item
        # Use a small epsilon to avoid division by zero if an item perfectly fills a bin.
