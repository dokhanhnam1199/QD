**Analysis:**
*   **Heuristic 1 vs. Heuristic 2:** Heuristic 2 introduces parameters (`epsilon`, `penalty_factor`) that are explicitly tuned, suggesting an attempt at calibration. It also uses a ratio-based penalty (`remaining_after_fit / item`), which is more adaptive to item size than the absolute gap used in Heuristic 1. Heuristic 2 also normalizes its final scores to [0, 1], promoting consistency.
*   **Heuristic 2 vs. Heuristic 3:** Heuristic 2's penalty is logarithmic and ratio-based, offering a smoother and more adaptive penalization compared to Heuristic 3's linear, ratio-based penalty. Heuristic 3's normalization is absent, which can lead to less predictable priority scales.
*   **Heuristic 3 vs. Heuristic 4:** Heuristic 4 attempts to normalize its "Best Fit" scores and uses an exponential penalty (though the implementation seems to use a log-based penalty which is then normalized). Heuristic 3 uses a simpler linear penalty on the ratio. The normalization and smoother penalty in Heuristic 4 are generally preferred.
*   **Heuristic 4 vs. Heuristic 5:** Heuristic 4 normalizes its best-fit scores and applies a normalized log penalty, aiming for a more balanced approach. Heuristic 5 uses a simpler additive penalty (the remaining capacity itself), which can be overly aggressive in discarding larger bins, and it doesn't normalize its final scores.
*   **Heuristic 5 vs. Heuristic 6:** Heuristic 6 is identical to Heuristic 1. Heuristic 5 uses an additive penalty (remaining capacity), which is less nuanced than Heuristic 1's logarithmic penalty.
*   **Heuristic 6 vs. Heuristic 7:** Heuristic 7 is identical to Heuristic 2. Heuristic 6 (same as 1) uses an absolute gap penalty, whereas Heuristic 7 (same as 2) uses a ratio-based, logarithmic penalty, making Heuristic 7's approach more adaptive.
*   **Heuristic 7 vs. Heuristic 8:** Heuristic 7 focuses on Best Fit and a ratio-based penalty. Heuristic 8 combines Best Fit, First Fit, and a fullness score with fixed weights. While multi-objective is good, the fixed weights and the specific formulation of the "fullness score" (potentially assuming fixed bin capacity) make it less robust than Heuristic 7's adaptive ratio penalty. The normalization in Heuristic 7 is also clearer.
*   **Heuristic 8 vs. Heuristic 9:** Heuristic 9 is identical to Heuristic 8.
*   **Heuristic 9 vs. Heuristic 10:** Heuristic 10 uses a sigmoid-like penalty, which is a more sophisticated way to penalize large remaining capacities compared to the weighted sum in Heuristic 9. Heuristic 10 also adapts the penalty relative to the item size more directly.
*   **Heuristic 10 vs. Heuristic 11:** Heuristic 11 is identical to Heuristic 10.
*   **Heuristic 11 vs. Heuristic 12:** Heuristic 12 is identical to Heuristic 10.
*   **Heuristic 12 vs. Heuristic 13:** Heuristic 13 is identical to Heuristic 10.
*   **Heuristic 13 vs. Heuristic 14:** Heuristic 14 is identical to Heuristic 10.
*   **Heuristic 14 vs. Heuristic 15:** Heuristic 15 is identical to Heuristics 16-20, representing minimal logic. Heuristic 14 (and 10-13) implements a combination of Best Fit and a sophisticated sigmoid-based penalty.
*   **Heuristics 15-20:** These heuristics are identical and only provide the initial setup (priorities array and mask check), offering no actual scoring logic. They are the worst due to lack of implementation.

Overall, heuristics combining a strong Best Fit component with adaptive, smooth penalties (especially ratio-based or sigmoid-based) that are normalized tend to perform better. Tuned parameters and explicit normalization contribute to a more robust and predictable heuristic.

**Experience:**
Prioritize adaptive penalties (ratio-based, logarithmic, sigmoid) over absolute or linear ones. Normalize scores to a consistent range [0, 1] for predictability. Explicitly tune penalty parameters and add small epsilon values for numerical stability. Combining multiple objectives requires careful weighting and normalization.
