**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1-2 (identical) vs. Heuristics 4-6 (identical): Heuristics 1-2 use a weighted combination of normalized differences and capacities, while 4-6 implement a strict Best Fit by picking the minimum difference. Heuristics 1-2 are more nuanced by considering the overall bin capacity, potentially leading to better packing density.

Comparing Heuristics 3 & 5-6 (identical) vs. Heuristics 7-9 & 13-15 & 18-19 (identical): Heuristics 3, 5-6 use a sigmoid-based penalty for remaining capacity in conjunction with Best Fit. Heuristics 7-9, 13-15, 18-19 use a similar concept but with different formulations (sigmoid vs. log) and parameters. Heuristic 7, in particular, introduces an adaptive penalty based on the capacity-to-item ratio, which is more dynamic than a fixed sigmoid. The ranking suggests that the specific implementation of these combined strategies matters.

Comparing Heuristics 7 vs. 10-12 vs. 20: Heuristics 10-12 and 20 refine the Best Fit with penalties, with 10-12 using a sigmoid-like penalty and 20 adding an overall capacity bias. Heuristic 7 uses a sigmoid-like penalty but on the capacity-to-item ratio, which might be more robust than penalizing raw remaining capacity directly. Heuristic 20's explicit addition of a capacity bias might lead to over-optimization for specific scenarios.

Comparing Heuristics 16-17 (identical) vs. others: Heuristics 16-17 combine Best Fit and First Fit with adaptive weights based on capacity standard deviation. This is a novel approach that attempts to balance tightness and fragmentation. However, their lower ranking suggests this adaptive weighting might not always be superior or is perhaps less effectively implemented than the refined Best Fit with penalties.

Comparing Heuristics 13-15 & 18-19 (identical) vs. Heuristics 8-9 (identical): Heuristics 13-15 and 18-19 seem to be incomplete versions of the strategy in Heuristics 8-9, which implement Best Fit with a logarithmic penalty. The absence of the actual calculation in the former makes them worse.

Overall: The best heuristics (1-3, 7, 10-12, 16-17, 20) generally combine a strong Best Fit component with some form of penalty or score for remaining capacity, often using sigmoid or logarithmic functions for smooth adjustments. Normalization and adaptive weighting (like in 7, 10-12, 16-17) appear to be key for robust performance. Strict Best Fit (4-6) and incomplete implementations are worst.

**Experience:**
Prioritize robust "Best Fit" with smooth, adaptive penalties for wasted space. Combining metrics like "fit tightness" and "capacity utilization" (e.g., capacity-to-item ratio) via normalized scores or sigmoid/logarithmic functions often yields superior results. Avoid simplistic strict Best Fit or incomplete logic.
