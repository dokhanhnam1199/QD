{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nFocus on balanced penalties (e.g., log, exp, sigmoid) over aggressive subtractions. Normalize scores for better comparison. Combine strong base heuristics (like Best Fit) with well-calibrated secondary objectives to create robust strategies. Experimentation with penalty function forms and parameters is key.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize heuristics that directly minimize wasted space (e.g., inverse of remaining gap) for \"best fit\". Sigmoid/softmax can offer nuanced control but requires careful parameter tuning. Explicitly handle non-fitting bins with very low priorities (e.g., `-inf`). Vectorized operations are generally preferred over loops for performance.\n\nHybrid heuristics combining \"Best Fit\" with secondary criteria (e.g., bin fullness, penalty for excess space) generally outperform pure \"Best Fit.\" Careful weighting and normalization are crucial; additive combinations can be unstable, while multiplicative or conditional penalties offer better control. Simplicity in combining metrics is often preferred over overly complex formulations.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
