Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, contextual, multi-objective, calibration, generalization.
*   **Advice:** Focus on learning *how* to balance competing objectives, rather than hardcoding fixed rules. Develop mechanisms to dynamically adjust penalty weights based on the problem instance's characteristics and the current state of the search.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on static, problem-specific heuristics like "minimizing wasted space" as the sole driver. Avoid brittle additive combinations of objectives without proper normalization or dynamic weighting.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection involves understanding *why* certain strategies work and identifying their limitations. This allows for adaptive heuristic design that generalizes better, moving beyond simple greedy approaches to more sophisticated, context-aware decision-making.
