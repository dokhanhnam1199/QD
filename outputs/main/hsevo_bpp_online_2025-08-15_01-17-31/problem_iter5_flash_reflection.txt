**Analysis:**

*   **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Heuristic 1 uses a simple average of 'best fit' and 'slack' scores, aiming to balance immediate fit with fuller bins. Heuristic 2 combines 'best fit' with an 'almost full' boost, prioritizing very tight fits. Heuristic 1's approach seems more balanced by explicitly considering slack.
*   **Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd):** Heuristic 2 is identical to Heuristic 1, but with different internal calculation names and a slightly different combination logic (addition vs. averaging). Heuristic 3 is identical to Heuristic 1. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the ranking or code provided, as 1, 2, and 3 are very similar. However, focusing on the *intended* logic of Heuristic 2 (adding `almost_full_boost`), it might overemphasize "almost full" bins compared to the balanced approach of Heuristic 1/3.
*   **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** Heuristic 3 (and 1) uses a scoring system based on inverse capacities. Heuristic 4 implements a pure "Best Fit" by assigning a priority of 1.0 to bins with the minimum gap, and 0 otherwise. Heuristic 3's nuanced scoring is generally better than a binary Best Fit, as it allows for finer selection among good fits.
*   **Comparing (4th) vs (5th):** Heuristic 4 is pure Best Fit. Heuristic 5 attempts to normalize Best Fit scores and add a "fullness" score, but the combination (addition) and re-normalization might lead to unintended weighting. Heuristic 4's simplicity and directness of Best Fit might be more robust than Heuristic 5's complex normalization and combination.
*   **Comparing (5th) vs (6th):** Heuristic 5 attempts normalization and a weighted combination. Heuristic 6 is identical to Heuristic 4 (pure Best Fit). This reinforces that Heuristic 4 (pure Best Fit) is likely superior to Heuristic 5's complicated approach.
*   **Comparing (7th) and (11th/12th/13th):** Heuristic 7 proposes a score of `(1.0 / gaps) - bins_that_can_fit_caps`. This attempts to combine Best Fit with a penalty for large bin capacity, which can be good. However, the direct subtraction might lead to negative priorities where the penalty outweighs the Best Fit score, making interpretation and comparison difficult. Heuristics 11-13 implement a similar idea with a conditional penalty for "too much" remaining space. This conditional penalty (Heuristics 11-13) is a more controlled way to handle the "overly large remaining capacity" issue than Heuristic 7's direct subtraction.
*   **Comparing (8th) vs (2nd):** Heuristic 8 is identical to Heuristic 2.
*   **Comparing (9th) vs (1st):** Heuristic 9 weights 'waste reduction' (similar to Best Fit) and 'capacity utilization' (inverse of remaining capacity). This is a reasonable hybrid. Heuristic 1 averages these concepts. Heuristic 9's weighted approach might offer better control than Heuristic 1's simple average.
*   **Comparing (10th) vs (1st):** Heuristic 10 combines Best Fit with a factor that *reduces* priority for bins with *more* remaining capacity. This aims to penalize lightly used bins. Heuristic 1's "slack score" (inverse of remaining capacity) also favors fuller bins. Heuristic 10's multiplicative approach might be more effective at modulating Best Fit scores.
*   **Comparing (14th-20th) vs (4th):** Heuristics 14-20 are identical. They combine a normalized Best Fit score with an exponential penalty for "very empty" bins based on a capacity ratio. This is a sophisticated approach that balances tight fits with avoiding overly empty bins. It's more nuanced than pure Best Fit (Heuristic 4).

Overall: The top heuristics (1-3, 8-10) attempt to combine Best Fit with a secondary objective like favoring fuller bins or penalizing under-utilized bins using additive or multiplicative factors. Heuristics 14-20 represent a more refined version of this by using a normalized Best Fit score combined with an adaptive penalty. Heuristics 7 and 11-13 try to penalize large remaining capacities, but the implementation in 7 is problematic, while 11-13 are better. Pure Best Fit (4, 6) is simpler but less adaptive.

**Experience:**
Hybrid heuristics combining "Best Fit" with secondary criteria (e.g., bin fullness, penalty for excess space) generally outperform pure "Best Fit." Careful weighting and normalization are crucial; additive combinations can be unstable, while multiplicative or conditional penalties offer better control. Simplicity in combining metrics is often preferred over overly complex formulations.
