Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive prioritization, learning, meta-heuristics, state-space exploration.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that *learn* from past decisions and *adapt* their prioritization rules dynamically. Consider meta-heuristics that explore different heuristic strategies or parameter settings.
*   **Avoid:** Static, single-objective heuristics. Over-reliance on pre-defined rules without mechanisms for adjustment.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of just minimizing wasted space, aim to improve the *process* of finding good fits. Learning from previous placements can guide future choices, leading to more robust and efficient solutions, especially in complex, dynamic environments.
