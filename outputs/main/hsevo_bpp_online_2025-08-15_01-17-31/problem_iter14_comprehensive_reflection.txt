Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive penalties, multi-objective optimization, normalization, weighting, stability, generalization.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that balance multiple, potentially conflicting objectives (e.g., fit tightness, bin fullness, minimizing bin usage) using adaptive penalty functions and robust normalization techniques. Focus on creating a composite score that generalizes well across diverse problem instances.

*   **Avoid:** Purely "greedy" single-metric optimization (like minimizing only the remaining gap), overly aggressive or linear penalty functions, additive combinations of unnormalized scores, and hardcoded parameters without considering numerical stability or generalization.

*   **Explanation:** By integrating adaptive penalties and normalization, heuristics become more resilient and less susceptible to overfitting on specific data distributions. This allows for a more nuanced trade-off between objectives, leading to better overall performance and broader applicability, rather than relying on simple, potentially brittle, single-criterion decisions.
