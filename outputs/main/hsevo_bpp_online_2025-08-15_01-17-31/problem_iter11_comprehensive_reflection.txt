Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive penalties, normalization, multi-objective weighting, parameter tuning, stability.
*   **Advice:** Focus on relative performance and feature interactions. Design adaptive penalty functions that scale with the problem's current state (e.g., problem size, constraint violation magnitude). Experiment with different normalization techniques and their impact on score aggregation.
*   **Avoid:** Rigid, absolute penalty structures. Ignoring the interplay between different objectives when combining them. Overly simplistic aggregation methods for multi-objective problems.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to build heuristics that learn and adapt. Instead of fixed penalties, use functions that dynamically adjust. Normalization ensures that disparate metrics contribute meaningfully. Multi-objective design requires careful consideration of how to balance trade-offs, often favoring multiplicative or conditional logic over simple addition.
