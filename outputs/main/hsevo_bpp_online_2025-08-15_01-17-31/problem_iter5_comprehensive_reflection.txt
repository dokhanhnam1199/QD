Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights:

*   **Keywords:** Hybrid heuristics, weighted combination, conditional logic, penalty mechanisms.
*   **Advice:** Design hybrid heuristics that dynamically adjust their criteria. Explore conditional logic to switch between primary and secondary metrics based on the problem state (e.g., bin fullness).
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on a single, static metric (like inverse of remaining gap) as it can be brittle. Avoid overly complex multiplicative combinations that are hard to tune.
*   **Explanation:** Pure "best fit" is often suboptimal. Combining metrics thoughtfully, perhaps by penalizing certain outcomes or prioritizing states, leads to more robust and adaptable heuristics that can better navigate diverse problem instances.
