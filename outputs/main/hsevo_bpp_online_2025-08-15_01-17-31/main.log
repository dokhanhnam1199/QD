### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize heuristics that directly minimize wasted space (e.g., inverse of remaining gap) for "best fit". Sigmoid/softmax can offer nuanced control but requires careful parameter tuning. Explicitly handle non-fitting bins with very low priorities (e.g., `-inf`). Vectorized operations are generally preferred over loops for performance.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

        # AFTER placing the item. The bin that results in the SMALLEST remaining capacity
        # (closest to zero) is the "best fit".
        
        # Priority = 1 / (remaining_capacity_after_fit + 1e-9)
        # Or, to make it simpler and avoid potential overflow with very small gaps:
        # Priority = -gap, so smaller gaps have larger (less negative) priorities.
        # But we need to distinguish between different fits.
        
        # A common approach for "best fit" is to assign a high priority to the bin
        # where (bin_capacity - item) is minimized.
        # Let's create a priority that is higher for smaller (bin_capacity - item).
        
        # We can simply use the negative of the gap, and then take the reciprocal
        # to boost smaller gaps significantly.
        # If gap = 0.1, 1/0.1 = 10. If gap = 0.01, 1/0.01 = 100.
        # If gap = 1, 1/1 = 1. This seems to work.
        
        # Let's ensure a positive priority for fitting bins.
        # We can use a large base priority and subtract a penalty for larger gaps.
        # Or, let's directly map smallest gap to highest priority.
        
        # Priority = -(gap)
        # If we have gaps [0.1, 0.5, 0.05], priorities are [-0.1, -0.5, -0.05].
        # The bin with gap 0.05 is the best fit, but it has the lowest priority (-0.05 is larger than -0.1 and -0.5).
        # So we need to invert this.
        
        # Option 1: Using a penalty for gap
        # highest_priority_value = 1.0
        # penalty_per_unit_gap = 0.1
        # priorities[can_fit_mask] = highest_priority_value - (gaps * penalty_per_unit_gap)
        
        # Option 2: Directly use the reciprocal of gap (plus a small constant to avoid zero division)
        # This gives higher scores to smaller gaps.
        epsilon = 1e-9
        priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (gaps + epsilon)
        
        # Option 3: Maximize the remaining capacity if it's the best fit, otherwise minimize.
        # This is more "first fit" like.
        
        # Let's refine Option 2 to ensure clear ranking.
        # A slightly different approach: assign priority such that smaller gaps get HIGHER scores.
        # This could be by transforming `gaps` into a decreasing sequence of priorities.
        # Example: For gaps [0.1, 0.5, 0.05], we want scores like [high, medium, very_high].
        # The reciprocal of the gap provides this.
        
        # Let's make it even more aligned with "best fit" as minimizing waste.
        # The priority of a bin could be seen as how "tight" the fit is.
        # A tighter fit means the remaining capacity is smaller.
        # We want to maximize the score for the tightest fit.
        
        # So, for bins that fit, the priority can be -gap.
        # Then, we want to pick the bin with the MINIMUM gap.
        # So, the priority should be something that INCREASES as gap DECREASES.
        # The score should be inversely proportional to the gap.
        
        # Let's try to map gaps to a scoring system:
        # Gap: 0.01  -> Score: 100
        # Gap: 0.1   -> Score: 10
        # Gap: 0.5   -> Score: 2
        # This suggests a score that is roughly 1/gap.
        
        # The previous choice of 1.0 / (gaps + epsilon) works.
        # However, it might give very large scores to tiny gaps.
        # Let's make it more linear or bounded.
        
        # A simpler approach: subtract the gap from a large constant.
        # The bin with the smallest gap will have the largest score.
        # Let M be a sufficiently large number. Priority = M - gap.
        # If M=100, gaps [0.1, 0.5, 0.05] -> scores [99.9, 99.5, 99.95].
        # This works well. The smallest gap has the largest priority.
        
        # Let's choose a large constant. The range of remaining capacities might influence this.
        # If bin capacity is 1 and item size is 0.1, gaps can be up to ~0.9.
        # A constant like 1.0 should be sufficient if we normalize or scale the gaps.
        
        # Let's try to create a priority score such that the BEST FIT bin
        # gets the HIGHEST score.
        # The "best fit" is the bin with the smallest `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        
        # So, we want a function f(gap) such that f(gap1) > f(gap2) if gap1 < gap2.
        # A simple choice is `f(gap) = -gap`. This means smaller gaps have higher priorities.
        # Let's add an offset to ensure positive priorities or a baseline.
        # Priority = C - gap.
        
        # The actual values of priorities don't matter as much as their relative order.
        # The primary goal of best fit is to minimize the leftover space in the chosen bin.
        # So, the bins that leave the least space are preferred.
        
        # Let's define priority as inversely proportional to the capacity *after* filling the item.
        # So, priority = 1 / (remaining_capacity_after_fill).
        # This will maximize the score for the bin that has the smallest remaining capacity after filling.
        # This is the definition of best fit.
        
        remaining_capacity_after_fill = bins_that_can_fit - item
        # Use a small epsilon to avoid division by zero if an item perfectly fills a bin.
        epsilon = 1e-9
        priorities[can_fit_mask] = 1.0 / (remaining_capacity_after_fill + epsilon)

    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing Heuristics 1st and 2nd (identical, but listed as distinct): Both implement an "Almost Full Fit" strategy by assigning priority as the negative of the remaining capacity after fitting the item (`-fit_capacities`). This correctly prioritizes bins that result in smaller remaining space.

Comparing Heuristics 3rd and 8th (identical): These also implement a "Best Fit" strategy by assigning priority as the reciprocal of the remaining capacity after fitting (`1.0 / (gaps + epsilon)`). This approach effectively gives higher scores to bins with smaller gaps, aligning with the "Best Fit" principle of minimizing wasted space. The detailed comments explain the rationale well.

Comparing Heuristics 4th and the "Best Fit" variants (3rd/8th): Heuristic 4th uses `1.0 / (diff + epsilon)` for bins that can fit, similar to Best Fit. However, it then normalizes these priorities to be between 0 and 1. Normalization can sometimes obscure the fine-grained differences that exact values might convey, potentially making it less effective for pure prioritization unless the downstream selection mechanism specifically benefits from normalized inputs.

Comparing Heuristics 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th: These heuristics (5th, 6th, 7th, 9th) are largely similar to the "Best Fit" approach (3rd/8th), using `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)`. Heuristic 9th explicitly sets non-fitting bins to `-float('inf')`, which is a robust way to ensure they are never selected. Heuristic 5th and 7th are identical. Heuristic 6th uses a slightly different epsilon.

Comparing Heuristics 10th and 18th: Both attempt a softmax-like approach. Heuristic 10th scales `fit_values` by `max_fit` and then uses `exp(scaled_fit_values) / sum(exp_values)`. Heuristic 18th scales `fit_values` by `max(fit_values)` (handling the case of `max_fit` being 0) and assigns the raw `exp_fit` as priority, without normalizing by the sum. The lack of normalization in 18th means raw exponentiated values are used, which might be less stable or interpretable as probabilities compared to 10th.

Comparing Heuristics 11th and 12th: Heuristic 11th uses a sigmoid function applied to a ratio of `(residual / suitable_bins_cap)` and then inverts it, aiming to prioritize bins with less *relative* remaining capacity. Heuristic 12th also uses a sigmoid but aims to prioritize bins where the *absolute* remaining capacity after fitting is small, by using `target_norm_remain_cap - normalized_remain_cap` in the sigmoid input. Both use sigmoid transformations but with different inputs and interpretations, making direct comparison tricky without empirical testing. Heuristic 11th appears to be a more direct mapping towards minimizing waste ratio.

Comparing Heuristics 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th: Heuristic 13th uses a softmax on the inverse of the remaining capacity, similar to Best Fit but normalized. Heuristics 14th-17th (identical) use a sigmoid function applied to `excess_capacity` (i.e., `bins_remain_cap - item`) with a specific slope and intercept. This sigmoid function penalizes larger excess capacities. The specific choice of slope and intercept (10.0, -5.0) means the function saturates quickly.

Comparing Heuristics 19th and 20th (identical): These heuristics set priorities to `bins_remain_cap - item` for bins that can fit, and `-np.inf` for those that cannot. This is essentially a "Worst Fit" strategy if selecting the max, or if the negative of this is used, it's a variant of "Best Fit" but with linear scaling rather than inverse. The simple subtraction does not give a strong preference for the *tightest* fit as effectively as an inverse.

Overall: The "Best Fit" strategies (3rd, 8th, and their similar variants like 5th, 7th) that use the inverse of the remaining gap (`1 / (gap + epsilon)`) are strong contenders for good heuristics as they directly target minimizing waste. Heuristics that normalize or apply sigmoids (4th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th-17th) introduce complexities that may or may not improve performance over simpler "Best Fit" without careful tuning or specific problem characteristics. Heuristics 1st and 2nd ("Almost Full Fit") are a simpler form of Best Fit. The worst heuristics are those that use simple differences (19th, 20th) or do not effectively prioritize tight fits.

Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive prioritization, learning, meta-heuristics, state-space exploration.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that *learn* from past decisions and *adapt* their prioritization rules dynamically. Consider meta-heuristics that explore different heuristic strategies or parameter settings.
*   **Avoid:** Static, single-objective heuristics. Over-reliance on pre-defined rules without mechanisms for adjustment.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of just minimizing wasted space, aim to improve the *process* of finding good fits. Learning from previous placements can guide future choices, leading to more robust and efficient solutions, especially in complex, dynamic environments.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    suitable_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    if np.any(suitable_bins_mask):
        suitable_bins_cap = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask]
        
        best_fit_diff = suitable_bins_cap - item
        
        min_diff = np.min(best_fit_diff)
        
        best_fit_indices = np.where(best_fit_diff == min_diff)[0]
        
        original_indices = np.where(suitable_bins_mask)[0]
        
        for idx in best_fit_indices:
            priorities[original_indices[idx]] = 1.0
    
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive prioritization, learning, meta-heuristics, state-space exploration.
*   **Advice:** Focus on heuristics that *learn* from past decisions and *adapt* their prioritization rules dynamically. Consider meta-heuristics that explore different heuristic strategies or parameter settings.
*   **Avoid:** Static, single-objective heuristics. Over-reliance on pre-defined rules without mechanisms for adjustment.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of just minimizing wasted space, aim to improve the *process* of finding good fits. Learning from previous placements can guide future choices, leading to more robust and efficient solutions, especially in complex, dynamic environments.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

        # Let's use a function that increases with smaller `bins_that_can_fit_caps - item`.
        # The `best_fit_scores` already do this.

        # Let's try to combine a "Best Fit" aspect with a "First Fit Decreasing" like preference
        # for using up existing bins first.
        # The 1/(gap + epsilon) is a strong "Best Fit".
        
        # A potential improvement: If multiple bins offer a very tight fit (small gap),
        # we might prefer the one that has been used more or has less absolute capacity
        # to keep larger bins available for larger items.
        
        # Let's modify the score slightly to favor bins that are "more full" among the best fits.
        # This can be achieved by adding a term that increases with `bins_remain_cap`.
        # However, this might conflict with "Best Fit" if a slightly larger bin is a slightly worse fit.
        
        # Let's stick to a refined Best Fit. The core idea is to minimize the leftover space.
        # The previous `best_fit_scores` are good.
        # To make it more "adaptive" or "robust", we can consider a secondary criterion if multiple
        # bins have very similar small gaps.
        
        # Example:
        # Bins capacities: [10, 10, 10, 10]
        # Item: 3
        # Bins remain cap: [2, 5, 8, 9]
        # Item fits in all. Gaps: [2-3, 5-3, 8-3, 9-3] = [-1, 2, 5, 6] - This is wrong, it's `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        # Bins remain cap: [2, 5, 8, 9]
        # Item: 3
        # Bins remaining capacity: [2, 5, 8, 9]
        # Gaps: [2-3, 5-3, 8-3, 9-3] -> these are only for bins that fit.
        # Assume bins_remain_cap = [2, 5, 8, 9], item = 3.
        # can_fit_mask = [False, True, True, True]
        # bins_that_can_fit_caps = [5, 8, 9]
        # gaps = [5-3, 8-3, 9-3] = [2, 5, 6]
        # best_fit_scores = [1/(2+eps), 1/(5+eps), 1/(6+eps)] = [~0.5, ~0.2, ~0.16]
        # This prioritizes the bin with remaining capacity 5.

        # Consider the case where `item` itself is very large.
        # If `item` is close to bin capacity, the gap will be small.
        # The current `1.0 / (gaps + epsilon)` prioritizes these.
        
        # Let's try a slight modification to the priority to encourage using bins
        # that are "closer" to fitting the item without being too small.
        # This is essentially what Best Fit does.
        
        # We can also incorporate a slight bias towards bins that are *not* completely empty,
        # to encourage filling up partially used bins before starting new ones.
        # This is more of a "First Fit" idea, but can be combined.
        
        # Let's try prioritizing bins by their remaining capacity AFTER fitting the item.
        # We want to MINIMIZE this remaining capacity.
        # Priority = - (bins_remain_cap - item)
        # This directly makes smaller positive gaps have higher priority.
        # Example: gaps = [2, 5, 6] -> priorities = [-2, -5, -6]. Max is -2.
        # This means the bin with the smallest gap is prioritized.

        # Let's combine the "tight fit" with a "less empty" preference.
        # A simple way is to add a term that is inversely related to the remaining capacity.
        # Priority = (1.0 / (gaps + epsilon)) + log(bins_that_can_fit_caps)
        # This might be too complex.
        
        # A simpler combination: Best Fit score with a small bonus for bins that have
        # less *total* capacity (to use up partially filled bins first).
        # So, the priority for fitting bins will be:
        # score = (1.0 / (gaps + epsilon)) + (1.0 / (bins_that_can_fit_caps + epsilon))
        # This adds a preference for smaller capacity bins among those with similar gaps.
        
        # Let's normalize `bins_that_can_fit_caps` to avoid large values dominating.
        # Or, let's focus on the `gaps` and add a term that penalizes very large `bins_that_can_fit_caps`
        # when the gap is also not very small.
        
        # Revisit the core goal: pick the bin `j` that minimizes `bins_remain_cap[j] - item`.
        # The `best_fit_scores = 1.0 / (gaps + 1e-9)` achieves this by giving higher scores
        # to smaller positive gaps.
        
        # Let's try to slightly "flatten" the advantage of extremely small gaps,
        # and give a slight boost to bins that are "mediumly" sized and fit well.
        # This can be done by squaring the gap or using a different function.
        
        # Let's use a combination of "Best Fit" and "Worst Fit" (to keep options open).
        # No, the goal is best fit.
        
        # Consider a heuristic that looks at `bins_remain_cap - item` and `bins_remain_cap`.
        # We want to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        # We also implicitly want to use bins that are not excessively large if the fit is similar.
        
        # Let's propose a heuristic that prioritizes bins that have a small gap,
        # AND among those with small gaps, prefers bins that have less total capacity.
        # The score for a bin that fits:
        # priority_score = (1.0 / (bins_that_can_fit_caps - item + 1e-9))  # Best Fit part
        # Let's add a term that rewards using bins with smaller remaining capacity.
        # This could be `-(bins_that_can_fit_caps)`.
        # So, priority = (1.0 / (gaps + 1e-9)) - bins_that_can_fit_caps
        # This would favor smaller gaps, and among equal gaps, it favors smaller `bins_that_can_fit_caps`.
        
        priorities[can_fit_mask] = (1.0 / (gaps + 1e-9)) - bins_that_can_fit_caps
        
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    # We only want to penalize if remaining capacity is significantly larger than the item
    # Let's define "significantly larger" as > 2 * item for instance.
    # A simpler approach is to penalize based on the absolute remaining capacity if it's large.
    # Or penalize based on the *proportion* of capacity left.
    # Let's try penalizing remaining capacity relative to bin's original capacity (if known, but it's not).
    # Instead, let's penalize based on the *remaining_cap_after_fit - item*.
    # If remaining_cap_after_fit - item is large, we want a larger penalty.
    # Using log((valid_bins_remain_cap - item) + epsilon) can work, but a simpler penalty might be better.
    # Let's consider the "slack" as in priority_v0 but inverted, penalizing large slack.
    # A linear penalty on slack: -(valid_bins_remain_cap - item)
    # A better penalty based on "over-emptiness":
    # Penalty is higher if (valid_bins_remain_cap - item) is large compared to 'item'.
    # Let's adapt Heuristics 11-13 logic but make it simpler.
    # Penalty is proportional to the remaining capacity AFTER the item is placed, if it's "too much".
    # A threshold could be 'item', meaning if remaining capacity > item, penalize.
    # Or if remaining capacity > some fraction of bin capacity (unknown).
    # Let's try to penalize bins where `valid_bins_remain_cap - item` is large.
    # We want to reduce priority for bins that will be left very empty.
    # A simple penalty could be proportional to `valid_bins_remain_cap`.
    # Or `valid_bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # Let's use a penalty that decreases priority if remaining capacity is large.
    # The inverse of remaining capacity was used in v0 for "fullness". Let's use that in reverse.
    # Penalize if `valid_bins_remain_cap` is large.
    # Penalty = f(valid_bins_remain_cap). We want f to be decreasing.
    # Let's use a simple negative linear term on the remaining capacity itself.
    # This is related to the 'slack_scores' in v0 but as a penalty.
    # penalty = penalty_factor * valid_bins_remain_cap
    
    # Alternative penalty idea: penalize bins that are "too empty" in terms of how much
    # larger their remaining capacity is compared to the item size.
    # For example, if remaining_cap - item > item, then it's "too empty".
    # Let's create a penalty term that is larger for larger remaining capacities.
    # Using the inverse of remaining capacity from v0's slack_scores, but subtracting it.
    # This prioritizes bins that will be fuller.
    # `slack_scores` from v0: 1.0 / (valid_bins_remain_cap + epsilon)
    # If we subtract this, we penalize fuller bins. This is not what we want.
    # We want to penalize *emptier* bins.
    # Let's try: penalty is proportional to the *amount of wasted space* in the bin *after* fitting.
    # Wasted space = valid_bins_remain_cap - item
    # Penalty = penalty_factor * (valid_bins_remain_cap - item)
    # This would reduce priority for bins with larger remaining space.
    
    # Combine Best Fit with a penalty for bins that are likely to be left very empty.
    # The penalty is stronger for bins with a larger remaining capacity after placing the item.
    # We want to reduce the score if `valid_bins_remain_cap - item` is large.
    # Let's use the score `(valid_bins_remain_cap - item)` directly as a penalty.
    # This is effectively saying: `best_fit_score - penalty_factor * (remaining_capacity_after_fit)`.
    
    # Let's refine the penalty to be based on the "emptiness ratio" of the bin after packing.
    # If a bin has capacity C and we place item I, remaining is C-I.
    # If C-I is large, we penalize.
    # Consider the capacity ratio of the *remaining space* to the *item size*.
    # If `(valid_bins_remain_cap - item) / item` is large, we penalize.
    # `penalty_term = penalty_factor * ((valid_bins_remain_cap - item) / item)`
    # This handles cases where `item` is small, leading to large penalties if remaining is large.
    # Let's clip this ratio to avoid extreme values, perhaps by limiting how much larger the remaining space can be.
    # A simpler approach: penalize if `valid_bins_remain_cap` itself is large.
    # Let's use the `slack_scores` from v0 but adjust the combination.
    # `best_fit_scores` are good. We want to *decrease* priority if `valid_bins_remain_cap` is large.
    # So, we can subtract a term that increases with `valid_bins_remain_cap`.
    
    # Let's combine Best Fit with a penalty for remaining capacity that's much larger than the item size.
    # This aims to select bins that are "almost full" but can still accommodate the item.
    # The "gap" is `valid_bins_remain_cap - item`. Best Fit prioritizes small gaps.
    # The "slack" is `valid_bins_remain_cap`. We want to penalize large slack.
    # Let's define a penalty that is larger for larger slack.
    # A simple linear penalty: `penalty_amount = penalty_factor * valid_bins_remain_cap`
    # This could be too aggressive.
    
    # Consider Heuristic 10's approach: `best_fit_score * (1 - penalty_weight * (remaining_capacity / bin_capacity))`
    # Since bin_capacity is unknown, we can use `item` or a scaled `valid_bins_remain_cap`.
    # Let's try: `best_fit_score * (1 - penalty_factor * (valid_bins_remain_cap / (item + epsilon)))`
    # This would penalize bins where remaining capacity is large relative to item size.
    # If `valid_bins_remain_cap < item`, the term `(valid_bins_remain_cap / (item + epsilon))` is < 1.
    # `1 - penalty_factor * (...)` would be greater than `1 - penalty_factor`.
    # This boosts bins that leave less space *relative to item size*.
    # This is similar to boosting bins that are "almost full" when scaled by item size.
    
    # Let's combine the Best Fit score with a penalty that reduces priority for bins
    # with a large amount of remaining capacity *after* the item is placed.
    # We can use a term that is proportional to the remaining capacity itself.
    # Penalty = `penalty_factor * (valid_bins_remain_cap - item)`
    # This makes the priority: `best_fit_score - penalty_factor * (valid_bins_remain_cap - item)`
    # This is equivalent to prioritizing bins with `1 / (gap) - penalty_factor * (gap)`.
    
    # Let's adopt a penalty based on the "emptiness" of the bin *after* placement.
    # We want to penalize bins where `valid_bins_remain_cap` is large.
    # A simple way is to subtract a fraction of `valid_bins_remain_cap`.
    # The "gap" is `valid_bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Let's combine the inverse gap (best fit) with the inverse of remaining capacity (fullness).
    # v0 used (best_fit + slack)/2.
    # v1 uses normalized best_fit - penalty.
    # Let's try a weighted sum of best_fit_scores and a penalty for slack.
    # Penalty for slack: `penalty_factor * (valid_bins_remain_cap / (item + epsilon))`
    # This penalizes bins where remaining capacity is large relative to item size.
    # If `valid_bins_remain_cap = item`, penalty is `penalty_factor`.
    # If `valid_bins_remain_cap = 2 * item`, penalty is `2 * penalty_factor`.
    
    # Final approach: combine the 'best fit' score (inverse gap) with a penalty
    # that reduces priority for bins that will have a lot of remaining capacity.
    # This aims to select bins that are a tight fit and do not leave excessive empty space.
    # Penalty is applied if `valid_bins_remain_cap` is significantly larger than `item`.
    
    # Let's use the `best_fit_scores` and subtract a penalty proportional to the
    # `valid_bins_remain_cap` to favor fuller bins.
    # penalty_strength = 0.2 # Tunable parameter for penalty
    
    # Calculate combined priorities: Best fit score minus a penalty for remaining capacity.
    # This prioritizes bins that fit the item snugly (high best_fit_scores)
    # and de-prioritizes bins that will have a lot of remaining space.
    combined_priorities = best_fit_scores - penalty_strength * (valid_bins_remain_cap - item)

    # Best Fit: Minimize remaining capacity after packing
    # Calculate the difference between remaining capacity and item size
    remaining_after_fit = suitable_bins_cap - item
    
    # Adaptive penalty: Use a logarithmic function of the ratio of remaining capacity to item size.
    # This penalizes larger gaps more, but with diminishing returns (smoother than linear).
    # Add a small epsilon to the denominator to avoid division by zero if item size is 0 (though unlikely in BPP).
    # Add 1 to the denominator to ensure values are not excessively large when remaining_after_fit is small.
    # Using np.log with a base parameter can be more flexible.
    # For simplicity and keeping the original behavior, we'll use np.log1p which is log(1+x)
    # The ratio is remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)
    # The original code used log1p(remaining_after_fit / (item + 1e-9))
    # Let's generalize the addition to the denominator and consider the log base.
    # However, np.log1p(x) is log(1+x). So, if we want log(ratio), we'd use np.log(ratio).
    # The prompt implies modifying existing logic. The current logic uses log1p on the difference,
    # not directly on a ratio that might involve the item size as a denominator in a way that log_base would apply directly to the ratio.
    # Let's stick to the spirit of the original implementation which used log1p of a difference.
    # The ratio used inside log1p is (remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)).
    # If we want to generalize the 'add 1', it would be log1p(remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon))
    # The parameter `log_base` is not directly applicable to `np.log1p`. If the intent was `log_base(1 + x)`,
    # it would be `np.log(1 + x) / np.log(log_base)`.
    # Given the existing code, it's most likely that `epsilon` is the parameter to generalize.
    # The 'add 1' part of log1p is intrinsic to its definition, not a separate parameter from the original code.
    # If the intention was to generalize log(ratio) where ratio is remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon),
    # then the calculation would be different.
    # Let's assume the generalization is primarily around epsilon and potentially the implicit '1' in log1p.
    # However, changing the '1' in log1p would fundamentally alter the penalty's behavior from the original.
    # The most straightforward interpretation of generalizing "hardcoded variables" from the provided code
    # is to make `epsilon` a parameter. The `log1p` function itself implies `log(1+x)`, so the `+1` is part of that.

    # Re-interpreting the prompt: "Combine Best Fit strategy with an adaptive logarithmic penalty for remaining capacity."
    # The penalty is `np.log1p(remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon))`.
    # This is `log(1 + (remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)))`.
    # The '1' in `log1p` is not a hardcoded variable to be parameterized in the same way as `epsilon`.
    # It's part of the function's definition.
    # If we were to generalize the log base, the formula would be:
    # `np.log(1 + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)) / np.log(log_base)`
    # However, the original code uses `np.log1p`, not `np.log`.
    # Let's consider `item + 1e-9` as `item + epsilon`.
    # And `log1p(x)` as `log(1+x)`.
    # If the intention was to allow a different base for the logarithm,
    # and also a different value added to the denominator, it could be:
    # `log_base( (remaining_after_fit + constant_add) / (item + epsilon) )`
    # But the original code structure is specific: `log1p(difference / (item + epsilon))`.
    # The `+1` is within `log1p`.

    # Let's assume the prompt wants to parameterize `epsilon` and any explicit constants in the calculation.
    # The constant `1e-9` is `epsilon`.
    # The constant `1` inside `np.log1p` is part of the function.
    # If we were to change the penalty function to `np.log(constant_add + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon))`,
    # then `constant_add` could be a parameter.
    # However, the prompt is to *extract* variables from the existing code.

    # The existing code uses:
    # `remaining_after_fit / (item + 1e-9)`
    # `np.log1p(...)`
    # `np.max(penalty)`
    # `1.0 - normalized_penalty`

    # Parameters to extract:
    # 1. `epsilon` (1e-9)
    # 2. The implicit '+1' in `np.log1p`. This is tricky. If we were to replace `np.log1p(x)` with `np.log(ADD_VALUE + x)`,
    #    then `ADD_VALUE` is a parameter. In our case, `x = remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)`.
    #    So, `np.log(ADD_VALUE + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon))`.
    #    The original behavior is `log(1 + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon))`. So `ADD_VALUE = 1`.
    # 3. The normalization factor `np.max(penalty)`. If we wanted to control the scale of the penalty,
    #    we could divide by a parameter `penalty_scale` instead of `np.max(penalty)`.
    #    However, `np.max(penalty)` is a dynamic value, not a hardcoded constant.
    # 4. The inversion `1.0 - normalized_penalty`. This is a calculation to invert the priority.

    # Let's stick to literal hardcoded constants in the expression.
    # `1e-9` is a hardcoded constant.
    # `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty` is a literal.
    # The `1` in `np.log1p` is internal to the function, but if we were to write it out as `log(1+x)`, then `1` is a constant.

    # Let's define parameters that can alter the behavior as seen in the code:
    # `epsilon`: for the denominator.
    # `log_add_value`: the value added inside the logarithm (originally 1 in log1p).
    # `normalization_divisor`: a factor to normalize the penalty (originally np.max(penalty)).
    # `priority_inversion_constant`: the constant used for inverting the score (originally 1.0).

    # However, the prompt asks to make them *default parameters*.
    # The original code has `epsilon = 1e-9`.
    # The `log1p` implies an addition of `1`.
    # `np.max(penalty)` is dynamic.
    # `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty` is a literal.

    # Let's consider the variables that *can* be adjusted to tune the penalty behavior:
    # - The `epsilon` added to the item size.
    # - The behavior of the logarithm. `np.log1p(x)` is `log(1+x)`. If we generalize it, we might use `log(constant + x)`.
    # - The normalization process. Instead of dividing by `np.max(penalty)`, we could divide by a fixed value or a function of the item.

    # The prompt states: "extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters."

    # `1e-9` is a hardcoded constant. Let's call it `epsilon`.
    # The division `remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)` involves `item` and `epsilon`.
    # The `np.log1p` function inherently adds 1. If we were to change the penalty function to `np.log(X + Y/Z)`,
    # then `X` could be a parameter. Here, `X=1`.

    # Let's assume the intent is to parameterize `epsilon` and the implicit `1` in `log1p`.
    # We can replace `np.log1p(value)` with `np.log(log_add_value + value)`.
    # And replace `item + 1e-9` with `item + epsilon`.

    # Updated calculation:
    # `ratio_term = remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)`
    # `penalty = np.log(log_add_value + ratio_term)`

    # Now, how to normalize and invert?
    # `normalized_penalty = penalty / np.max(penalty)` (original)
    # `normalized_scores = priority_inversion_constant - normalized_penalty` (original with `priority_inversion_constant = 1.0`)

    # We can parameterize `epsilon`, `log_add_value`, and `priority_inversion_constant`.
    # `normalization_divisor` is trickier because the original uses `np.max(penalty)`.
    # If we want to keep the *spirit* of adaptive normalization based on the current set of bins,
    # then `np.max(penalty)` is the correct approach and not a parameter to be changed directly.
    # However, if we are to extract *all* hardcoded variables, then potentially `np.max` could be replaced by a constant divisor.
    # But that would change the meaning of normalization.

    # Let's focus on the most direct interpretations of "hardcoded variables" within the mathematical expression:
    # 1. `1e-9` -> `epsilon`
    # 2. The implicit `1` in `np.log1p`. Let's introduce `log_add_value`.
    # 3. The literal `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty`. Let's call it `inversion_offset`.

    # Let's refine the parameters based on typical BPP parameterization.
    # The penalty is usually some function of `(bin_capacity - item) / bin_capacity` or `(bin_capacity - item) / item`.
    # The original code uses `remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)`.
    # This is `(suitable_bins_cap - item) / (item + epsilon)`.

    # Let's consider the prompt very literally: "extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable".
    # `1e-9` is a hardcoded float.
    # `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty` is a hardcoded float.
    # The functions `np.log1p` and `np.max` operate on the data.

    # If we are to *make them become default parameters*, it implies we can control them.
    # `epsilon` is clearly one.
    # `np.log1p(x)` is `log(1+x)`. If we were to generalize this to `log(A + x)`, then `A` is a parameter.
    # The term `1.0 - ...` suggests `1.0` is a constant for inversion.

    # Let's assume we want to parameterize:
    # `epsilon`: the small constant added to the denominator.
    # `log_add`: the constant added inside the logarithm. (originally 1)
    # `inversion_const`: the constant used for inverting the score. (originally 1.0)

    # The normalization itself (`/ np.max(penalty)`) is adaptive, not a fixed hardcoded number.

    # If we consider `log_base` mentioned in the parameter_ranges description, then the penalty function might be:
    # `log_base(log_add_value + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon))`
    # which is `log(log_add_value + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)) / log(log_base)`
    # However, the original code used `np.log1p`, which is `log(1+x)`.
    # If we use `log_base=np.e`, then `np.log(1+x)` is the natural log.
    # If `log_base=2`, then it's log base 2.
    # The original code did *not* specify a log base, implying natural log (or base e for `np.log` if it were used).
    # `np.log1p` is base `e`.
    # If `log_base` is intended to parameterize the base of the logarithm, then the calculation becomes:
    # `ratio_term = remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)`
    # `log_value = np.log(log_add_value + ratio_term)`
    # `penalty = log_value / np.log(log_base)`

    # Let's try to map this to the given `parameter_ranges` example format.
    # It suggests ranges for parameters.

    # Candidate parameters:
    # 1. `epsilon`: for `item + epsilon`. A small positive float. Range: `(0, 1e-3)` seems reasonable.
    # 2. `log_add_value`: for `log(log_add_value + ...)`. The original uses `1`. Must be `> 0`. Range: `(0.1, 2.0)` could be a reasonable exploration.
    # 3. `inversion_const`: for `inversion_const - normalized_penalty`. The original is `1.0`. Range: `(0.5, 1.5)` could be explored.

    # The prompt mentions `log_base`. If we include it, it would be for `np.log(x) / np.log(log_base)`.
    # The original `np.log1p` implies `log_base = np.e`.
    # `log_base` should be `> 1` for standard log behavior. Range: `(np.e * 0.5, np.e * 2)` or `(2.0, 5.0)`.
    # However, the original code used `np.log1p`. If we change `np.log1p(x)` to `np.log(log_add_value + x)`, then `log_base` is not directly applicable unless we write it as `log_base(log_add_value + x)`.
    # The prompt implies `log_base` as a parameter in `parameter_ranges`. This suggests that the calculation should incorporate it.

    # Let's assume the generalized penalty function is:
    # `penalty = log_base(log_add_value + (suitable_bins_cap - item) / (item + epsilon))`
    # which in python would be:
    # `ratio_term = remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)`
    # `log_term = np.log(log_add_value + ratio_term)`
    # `penalty = log_term / np.log(log_base)`

    # And the scoring is:
    # `normalized_penalty = penalty / np.max(penalty)` (if np.max(penalty) > 0)
    # `normalized_scores = inversion_const - normalized_penalty`

    # This seems like a comprehensive interpretation.
    # Let's choose some reasonable ranges for these parameters.
    # `epsilon`: small positive float, prevents division by zero. `1e-9` in original. Range `(1e-9, 1e-5)`.
    # `log_add_value`: constant added in log. Original `1`. Must be `> 0`. Range `(0.1, 2.0)`.
    # `log_base`: base of logarithm. Original implicitly `np.e`. Range `(2.0, 10.0)`.
    # `inversion_const`: constant for inversion. Original `1.0`. Range `(0.5, 1.5)`.

    # Let's simplify the parameter list to match the spirit of "hardcoded variables".
    # The most apparent hardcoded variables are `1e-9` and `1.0`.
    # The "adaptive logarithmic penalty" implies `log` is involved.
    # If `log1p` is considered a unit, then the constant `1` is within it.

    # If the intention is to make the *calculation* more flexible with default parameters:
    # - `epsilon`: for `item + epsilon`
    # - `log_add`: for `log(log_add + ratio)`
    # - `inversion_offset`: for `inversion_offset - normalized_score`

    # Let's reconsider the prompt and the provided `parameter_ranges` structure.
    # The key `log_base` is explicitly requested in the thought process. This confirms that the logarithmic part should be configurable.

    # Final proposed parameters and their meaning in the context of the *original code's structure*:
    # `epsilon`: the `1e-9` value. Used as `item + epsilon`.
    # `log_add`: the implicit `1` in `np.log1p`. Used as `np.log(log_add + ratio)`.
    # `log_base`: the base of the logarithm. `np.log1p` uses `e`. Used as `np.log(x) / np.log(log_base)`.
    # `inversion_offset`: the `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty`.

    # Let's use `log_base` in the function signature as provided in the thought process.
    # We'll replace `np.log1p(remaining_after_fit / (item + 1e-9))`
    # with `np.log(log_add_value + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)) / np.log(log_base)`
    # and `1.0 - normalized_penalty` with `inversion_offset - normalized_penalty`.

    # `log_base` default should be `np.e` to match `np.log1p` behavior if `log_add_value` is 1.
    # Or perhaps, if `log_base=np.e` and `log_add_value=1`, and we use `np.log(1+x)`,
    # it is equivalent to `np.log1p(x)`. This seems a good way to preserve original behavior.

    # Let's define the parameters and their ranges:
    # `epsilon`: `1e-9` is the original. Range `(1e-9, 1e-5)`.
    # `log_add_value`: The original is `1` (from `log1p(x)` means `log(1+x)`). Must be positive. Range `(0.1, 2.0)`.
    # `log_base`: The base of the logarithm. `np.e` is the implied base of `np.log1p`. Range `(2.0, 10.0)`.
    # `inversion_offset`: The `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty`. Range `(0.5, 1.5)`.

    # The function signature will include these.

    # --- Code Implementation ---

    # Replace `item + 1e-9` with `item + epsilon`
    # Replace `np.log1p(ratio)` with `np.log(log_add_value + ratio) / np.log(log_base)`
    # Replace `1.0 - normalized_penalty` with `inversion_offset - normalized_penalty`

    # Calculate the ratio term first
    # Add `epsilon` to `item` in the denominator
    ratio_term = remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)
    
    # Calculate the logarithmic penalty
    # Ensure `log_add_value + ratio_term` is positive before taking log.
    # Given `remaining_after_fit >= 0` and `item + epsilon > 0`, `ratio_term >= 0`.
    # So `log_add_value + ratio_term` will be positive if `log_add_value > 0`.
    # If `log_base` is not `np.e`, we need to adjust.
    # `np.log(x, base)` function exists in Python's math module but not directly in numpy for array.
    # For arrays, we use `np.log(array) / np.log(base)`.

    # Ensure `log_base` is not 1 for `np.log(log_base)` to be non-zero.
    # And `log_add_value` must be > 0.
    
    # Handling potential issues:
    # If `log_base` is 1, `np.log(log_base)` would be 0, causing division by zero.
    # If `log_add_value + ratio_term` is 0 or negative, `np.log` would result in -inf or NaN.
    # `log_add_value` should be > 0. `ratio_term` is >= 0. So `log_add_value + ratio_term` is always > 0.
    
    # Let's ensure `log_base` is not 1. We can set a minimum value for `log_base` or handle the division.
    # If `log_base` is intended to be used, and original was `log1p` (base e),
    # then `np.log(1 + ratio) / np.log(np.e)` is equivalent to `np.log1p(ratio)`.
    # So, the default for `log_base` should be `np.e` and `log_add_value` should be `1.0`.
    
    # If np.max(penalty) is 0, it means all penalties were -infinity or NaN or 0.
    # In the original code, if np.max(penalty) <= 0, it sets normalized_scores to ones.
    # This handling should be preserved.

    # Use `np.finfo(float).eps` as a safe minimum for `log_base` if it could be close to 1.
    # Or simply enforce `log_base > 1.0`.
    
    # Calculation for penalty:
    # `log_term_arg = log_add_value + ratio_term`
    # `log_val = np.log(log_term_arg)`
    # `penalty = log_val / np.log(log_base)`

    # A more direct approach to handle `log_base` with numpy:
    # if log_base != 1.0:
    #     penalty = np.log(log_add_value + ratio_term) / np.log(log_base)
    # else:
    #     # What happens if log_base is 1? The value is 1, log(1)=0.
    #     # This scenario likely shouldn't happen with valid ranges.
    #     # If log_base=1, it's not really a log. Perhaps it means linear?
    #     # For now, assume log_base > 1.0.
    #     pass

    # The current code uses `np.log1p(remaining_after_fit / (item + 1e-9))`
    # Let's create the new calculation:
    
    # --- Parameters and their defaults ---
    # `epsilon = 1e-9`
    # `log_add_value = 1.0` (for `log(1+x)` from `log1p(x)`)
    # `log_base = np.e` (natural log from `log1p`)
    # `inversion_offset = 1.0` (for `1.0 - ...`)

    # The function signature will be:
    # `def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, epsilon: float = 1e-9, log_add_value: float = 1.0, log_base: float = np.e, inversion_offset: float = 1.0) -> np.ndarray:`

    # Inside the function:
    # `suitable_bins_cap = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask]`
    # `remaining_after_fit = suitable_bins_cap - item`
    # `ratio_term = remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)`
    
    # Calculate penalty:
    # `log_argument = log_add_value + ratio_term`
    # Use `np.maximum` to ensure argument to `log` is positive, although `log_add_value > 0` should ensure this.
    # `log_argument = np.maximum(log_argument, np.finfo(float).eps)`
    
    # `log_value = np.log(log_argument)`
    # If `log_base` is not `np.e`, we need to divide by `np.log(log_base)`.
    # Ensure `log_base > 1` and `log_base != 1`.
    # `log_base_term = np.log(np.maximum(log_base, 2.0))` # Ensure base is at least 2.
    # `penalty = log_value / log_base_term`

    # Let's redefine the parameter ranges and defaults to be safe and logical.
    # `epsilon`: 1e-9 -> (1e-9, 1e-5)
    # `log_add_value`: 1.0 -> (0.1, 2.0) (must be > 0)
    # `log_base`: np.e -> (2.0, 10.0) (must be > 1)
    # `inversion_offset`: 1.0 -> (0.5, 1.5)

    # Okay, the code block should contain the modified function.
    # The `parameter_ranges` dictionary should contain the definitions.

    # Let's think about the prompt again: "extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable".
    # In the original code:
    # `1e-9` is a hardcoded constant for epsilon.
    # The implicit `1` in `np.log1p` is a hardcoded constant.
    # The `1.0` in `1.0 - normalized_penalty` is a hardcoded constant.
    # The `np.max(penalty)` is a dynamic value used for normalization. Is it a "hardcoded variable"? No.
    # The question is how to *make it become default parameters*.

    # The `log_base` is mentioned in the context of `parameter_ranges`. This implies it should be a parameter.
    # If `log_base` is a parameter, the penalty calculation needs to reflect that.
    # The original `np.log1p(x)` is `log_e(1+x)`.
    # So, if we generalize, it's `log_base(log_add_value + x)`.

    # Let's ensure the code only uses the parameters.
    # And the `parameter_ranges` dictionary is correctly formatted.

    # Original: `penalty = np.log1p(remaining_after_fit / (item + 1e-9))`
    # Generalized: `penalty = np.log(log_add_value + remaining_after_fit / (item + epsilon)) / np.log(log_base)`
    # Original: `normalized_scores = 1.0 - normalized_penalty`
    # Generalized: `normalized_scores = inversion_offset - normalized_penalty`

    # Ensure `log_base` is handled. If `log_base` is close to 1, `np.log(log_base)` is close to 0.
    # A safe approach for `log_base` is to ensure it's strictly greater than 1.
    # The parameter range `(2.0, 10.0)` ensures this.
    # The default `np.e` is also fine.

    # The handling of `np.max(penalty)`:
    # If `np.max(penalty) > 0`, then `normalized_penalty = penalty / np.max(penalty)`.
    # Else, `normalized_scores = np.ones_like(suitable_bins_cap)`.
    # This part remains the same logic, just applied to the new `penalty` calculation.

    # Let's consider the output requirements:
    # 1. Output code only, enclosed in ```python ... ```.
    # 2. Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only, enclosed in ```python ... ```.

    # The definition of `parameter_ranges` needs to be exactly as requested:
    # "Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter."

    # Example for epsilon:
    # 'epsilon': (1e-9, 1e-5)
    # Example for log_add_value:
