Scale-sensitive demand/depot factors, controlled randomness, and adaptive sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Focus on multiplicative combination, dynamic sparsification, and depot proximity for better heuristics.

Consider route context (remaining capacity), adaptive parameter tuning, and targeted edge boosting.

Better code: Depot-relative angles, demand consideration, and adaptive sparsification based on mean distance.

Multiplicative combination, dynamic sparsification, and refined scaling enhance heuristic performance.

Refine factor combinations, use dynamic sparsification, and consider problem size for better heuristics.

Refine factor combinations, sparsification, depot handling, and controlled randomness for better heuristic design.

Multiplicative combination, adaptive sparsification, and normalized factors improve heuristic performance.

Focus on angle calculation, demand scaling, adaptive sparsification, and controlled stochasticity for improvements.

Adaptive weights, distance-scaled randomness, refined sparsification, and depot handling improve heuristic quality.
