Weighted factors, localized sparsification, and specific depot edge handling improve heuristic performance.

The better code uses multiplicative combination of factors, explicit capacity ratio, and quantile-based sparsification.

Consider angle, stochasticity, adaptive sparsification, and avoid hand-tuning factor weights.

Global angle context, simpler factor combinations, and stochasticity appear beneficial.

Angles, adaptive thresholds, and multiplicative factor combination are key improvements.

The better code uses weighted, normalized factors (distance, demand, depot proximity) and sparsification for improved edge selection.

Focus on accurate angle calculation, demand compatibility, and top-N sparsification for improved edge selection.

Better heuristics normalize values, refine angle calculations using closest nodes, and sparsify based on normalized thresholds.

Consider angles, weighted combinations, and sparsification strategies for better heuristics.

Savings calculations, demand considerations, and aggressive sparsification improve heuristic quality.
