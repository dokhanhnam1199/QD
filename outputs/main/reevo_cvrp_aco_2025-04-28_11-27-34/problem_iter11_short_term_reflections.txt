Multiplicative combination, adaptive threshold, and distance-scaled randomness enhance heuristic performance. Normalize each factor before combining.

Multiplicative combination, depot proximity, dynamic sparsification using quantiles, and demand-aware scaling are beneficial.

Normalize factors, use adaptive sparsification, and distance-scaled randomness for improved exploration-exploitation balance.

Normalize factors, use adaptive thresholds, and scale randomness inversely with distance for better heuristic design.

Stochasticity, adjusted scaling, aggressive sparsification, and multiplicative combination of factors appear beneficial.

Multiplicative combination, simpler demand/distance scaling, and adaptive sparsification based on means improved performance.

Prioritize depot proximity, adaptive sparsification (quantiles), and controlled randomness for improved exploration.

Multiplicative combination, dynamic sparsification, and depot proximity scaling improved heuristic performance.

Multiplicative combination, adaptive sparsification, and distance-scaled randomness improved heuristic quality.

Multiplicative combination, depot proximity, dynamic sparsification with quantiles, and demand scaling improve CVRP heuristics.
