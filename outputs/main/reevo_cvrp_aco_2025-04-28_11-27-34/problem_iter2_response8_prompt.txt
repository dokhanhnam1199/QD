{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix (shape: n by n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (shape: n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n by n).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Parameters (can be tuned)\n    alpha = 1.0  # Importance of distance\n    beta = 0.5  # Importance of demand consideration\n    gamma = 0.2  # Importance of closeness to depot\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                distance = distance_matrix[i, j]\n\n                # Demand factor: Prioritize edges connecting to nodes with demands that are not too large to fill vehicle space but neither too small.\n                demand_factor = 1.0\n                if i != 0 and j!=0: #if both are not the depot\n                    demand_factor = np.exp(-((demands[i] + demands[j]) / capacity - 0.5) ** 2 / 0.08)\n                elif i!= 0: #if only one of them is the depot\n                    demand_factor = np.exp(-(demands[i] / capacity - 0.25)**2 / 0.08)\n                elif j!=0: #if only one of them is the depot\n                    demand_factor = np.exp(-(demands[j] / capacity - 0.25)**2 / 0.08)\n                \n\n                # Closeness to depot factor: Encourage edges connecting nodes close to the depot.\n                depot_distance_factor = np.exp(-((distance_matrix[0, i] + distance_matrix[0, j]) / (np.sum(distance_matrix[0, :]) / n))) if (i != 0 and j!= 0) else 1.0\n\n                # Combine factors\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = (\n                    (1 / (distance + 1e-6)) ** alpha\n                    * (demand_factor) ** beta\n                    * (depot_distance_factor) ** gamma\n                )\n\n    #Sparsify the matrix.
