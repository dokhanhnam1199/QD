    """
    A heuristic function for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using stochastic solution sampling principles.

    This version incorporates several factors to assess the desirability of including each edge in a solution:
    - Distance: Shorter distances are generally preferred.
    - Demand: Edges connecting nodes with high demands might be less desirable if they risk exceeding vehicle capacity early.
    - Closeness to Depot: Edges connecting nodes far from the depot might be penalized, encouraging vehicles to return to the depot more frequently.
    - Sparsification:  Sets low-probability edges to zero to focus on promising connections.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A matrix of distances between all nodes (n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): A matrix of node coordinates (n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): A vector of customer demands (n).
        capacity (int): The capacity of each vehicle.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A matrix of heuristic values, indicating the desirability of each edge (n x n).
