{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.\n    This version incorporates more sophisticated heuristic combinations and sparsification.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # 1.
