    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.
    Version 3: Further refines v2 with lookahead demand consideration, edge reciprocity, and parameter tuning.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.
