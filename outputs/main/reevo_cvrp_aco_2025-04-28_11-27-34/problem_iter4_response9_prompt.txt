Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    A heuristic function for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) based on stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    This version incorporates a combination of factors:\n    - Distance: Shorter distances are preferred.\n    - Demand: Edges connecting to nodes with high demands are penalized (to encourage efficient capacity utilization).\n    - Angle: Edges that form sharp turns are penalized.\n    - Capacity Ratio: Prioritizes connection to nodes such that the total capacity in current tour is less than vehicle capacity.\n    - Sparsity: Sets elements of the matrix to zero if deemed unpromising.\n\n    This version uses a multiplicative combination of factors, explicit capacity ratio, and quantile-based sparsification.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix: A NumPy array representing the distance between nodes.\n        coordinates: A NumPy array of node coordinates (x, y).\n        demands: A NumPy array of node demands.\n        capacity: The capacity of each vehicle.\n\n    Returns:\n        A NumPy array of the same shape as the distance_matrix, representing the heuristic values for each edge.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # Parameters (can be tuned)\n    distance_weight = 1.0\n    demand_weight = 0.5\n    angle_weight = 0.2\n    capacity_weight = 0.3\n    sparsity_threshold = 0.2  # Adjust for desired sparsity\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0  # No self-loops\n                continue\n\n            # Distance factor (prefer shorter distances)\n            distance_factor = distance_weight / (distance_matrix[i, j] + 1e-6) # avoid division by zero\n\n            # Demand factor (penalize connections to very high demand nodes).
