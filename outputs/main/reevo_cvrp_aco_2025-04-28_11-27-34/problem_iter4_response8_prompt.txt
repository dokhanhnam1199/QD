{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for CVRP that combines distance, demand, and angle information.\n    It sparsifies the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero after normalization.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix: Distance matrix (n x n).\n        coordinates: Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands: Customer demands (n).\n        capacity: Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        A matrix of the same shape as the distance_matrix, indicating the\n        promise of each edge.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Parameters (can be tuned)\n    distance_weight = 0.5\n    demand_weight = 0.3\n    angle_weight = 0.2\n    sparsification_threshold = 0.1  # remove edges below this threshold\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0  # No self-loops\n                continue\n\n            # Distance factor (normalized)\n            distance_factor = 1 / (distance_matrix[i, j] + 1e-6)  # Avoid division by zero\n\n            # Demand factor: Favor edges connecting nodes with compatible demands\n            # Penalize edges that would easily lead to capacity violations\n            demand_factor = 1 - min(1, (demands[i] + demands[j]) / (2 * capacity))\n\n            # Angle factor: Favor edges that don't create sharp turns\n            # Calculate the angle between the edge (i, j) and the x-axis.\n            angle = np.arctan2(coordinates[j, 1] - coordinates[i, 1], coordinates[j, 0] - coordinates[i, 0])\n\n            closest_node_angle_diff = np.inf  # initialize to maximum value\n            for k in range(n):\n                if k != i and k != j:  # avoid current node, or node j\n                    temp_angle = np.arctan2(coordinates[k, 1] - coordinates[i, 1], coordinates[k, 0] - coordinates[i, 0])\n                    angle_diff = np.abs(angle - temp_angle)  # take smallest turn\n\n                    if angle_diff < closest_node_angle_diff:\n                        closest_node_angle_diff = angle_diff\n\n            angle_factor = 1 - min(1, closest_node_angle_diff / np.pi)  # map from [0, pi] -> [0, 1]. larger = good\n\n            # Overall heuristic value\n            heuristic_value = (\n                distance_weight * distance_factor\n                + demand_weight * demand_factor\n                + angle_weight * angle_factor\n            )\n\n            heuristic_matrix[i, j] = heuristic_value\n\n    # Sparsification: Remove unpromising edges\n    max_val = np.max(heuristic_matrix)\n\n    if max_val > 0:  # avoid divide by 0\n        heuristic_matrix = heuristic_matrix / max_val  # Normalize matrix\n\n        heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < sparsification_threshold] = 0\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\n[Better code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # Heuristic factors:\n    # 1.
