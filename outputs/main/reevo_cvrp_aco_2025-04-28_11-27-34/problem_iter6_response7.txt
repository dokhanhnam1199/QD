    """
    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.
    Version 3: Focuses on multiplicative combinations, adaptive sparsification, depot proximity,
    angle calculations, demand-capacity scaling, controlled randomness, and prioritized depot connections.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).
