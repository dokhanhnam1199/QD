{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n\n    \"\"\"\n    A heuristic function for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using stochastic solution sampling principles.\n\n    This version incorporates several factors to assess the desirability of including each edge in a solution:\n    - Distance: Shorter distances are generally preferred.\n    - Demand: Edges connecting nodes with high demands might be less desirable if they risk exceeding vehicle capacity early.\n    - Closeness to Depot: Edges connecting nodes far from the depot might be penalized, encouraging vehicles to return to the depot more frequently.\n    - Savings: Savings from merging two routes.\n    - Sparsification:  Sets low-probability edges to zero to focus on promising connections.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A matrix of distances between all nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): A matrix of node coordinates (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): A vector of customer demands (n).\n        capacity (int): The capacity of each vehicle.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: A matrix of heuristic values, indicating the desirability of each edge (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Parameters (tunable)\n    distance_weight = 1.0\n    demand_weight = 0.5\n    depot_proximity_weight = 0.5\n    savings_weight = 0.5\n    sparsification_threshold = 0.1  # Adjust this value for more or less sparsification\n\n    # Calculate savings matrix\n    savings_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            savings_matrix[i, j] = distance_matrix[0, i] + distance_matrix[0, j] - distance_matrix[i, j]\n            savings_matrix[j, i] = savings_matrix[i, j]  # Savings matrix is symmetric\n\n    # Normalize the distance matrix (important for scaling)\n    max_distance = np.max(distance_matrix)\n    normalized_distance_matrix = distance_matrix / (max_distance + 1e-6) #Avoid div by zero.\n\n    max_savings = np.max(savings_matrix)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0  # No self-loops\n                continue\n\n            # Distance factor: inversely proportional to distance\n            distance_factor = distance_weight / (normalized_distance_matrix[i, j] + 1e-6)  # Adding a small constant to avoid division by zero\n\n            # Demand factor: Penalize edges that connect to nodes with higher demands\n            demand_factor = 1.0 - demand_weight * (demands[i] + demands[j]) / (2 * capacity + 1e-6)  # Scaled relative to the capcity\n\n            # Depot proximity factor: Encourage returns to depot\n            depot_distance_i = distance_matrix[i, 0] #Distance from node i to depot\n            depot_distance_j = distance_matrix[j, 0] #Distance from node j to depot\n\n            depot_proximity_factor = 1.0 - depot_proximity_weight * (depot_distance_i + depot_distance_j) / (2 * max_distance + 1e-6)\n\n            #Savings factor\n            savings_factor = 0.0\n            if max_savings > 0:\n                savings_factor = savings_weight * savings_matrix[i,j]/max_savings\n\n            # Combine the factors\n            heuristic_matrix[i, j] = distance_factor * max(0, demand_factor) * max(0, depot_proximity_factor) + savings_factor\n\n    # Sparsification: Zero out low-probability edges\n    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristic_matrix)\n    if max_heuristic > 0:\n        threshold = sparsification_threshold * max_heuristic\n        heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < threshold] = 0.0\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\n[Better code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors and stochastic sampling.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # Heuristic factors:\n    # 1.
