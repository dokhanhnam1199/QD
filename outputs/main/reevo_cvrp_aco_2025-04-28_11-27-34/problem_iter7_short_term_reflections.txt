Prioritize remaining capacity, tuneable parameters, and edge sparsification for efficient, informed search.

Prioritize distance, depot-relative angles, and demand. Tune weights adaptively and sparsify based on distance quantiles.

Multiplicative combination, adaptive sparsification, and controlled randomness improve heuristic performance.

Prioritize remaining capacity, learnable weights, and sparsification for effective CVRP heuristics.

Multiplicative combination, adaptive sparsification based on quantiles, and Gaussian demand scaling improved performance.

Multiplicative combination, depot proximity, adaptive sparsification, and Gaussian-like demand factor improve heuristic design.

Multiplicative combination, problem-size aware sparsification, and depot-edge restrictions improve heuristic quality.

Better heuristics use multiplicative combinations, adaptive sparsification, and depot/capacity awareness with controlled randomness.

Focus on direct angle calculation, adaptive weighting/sparsification, and controlled randomness scaled to distance.

Multiplicative combination, depot proximity, Gaussian demand penalty, and adaptive sparsification improve heuristic quality.
