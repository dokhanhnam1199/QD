{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "Write a heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.\n    Improved version with adaptive weights, sparsification, depot proximity, and demand consideration.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # --- Factor 1: Distance ---\n    distance_factor = 1 / (distance_matrix + 1e-6)  # Avoid division by zero\n    distance_factor_normalized = (distance_factor - np.min(distance_factor)) / (np.max(distance_factor) - np.min(distance_factor))\n\n    # --- Factor 2: Angle from Depot ---\n    angle_factor = np.ones((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                vector1 = coordinates[i] - coordinates[0]\n                vector2 = coordinates[j] - coordinates[i]\n\n                norm1 = np.linalg.norm(vector1)\n                norm2 = np.linalg.norm(vector2)\n                if norm1 > 0 and norm2 > 0:\n                    vector1 = vector1 / norm1\n                    vector2 = vector2 / norm2\n                    dot_product = np.dot(vector1, vector2)\n                    angle = np.arccos(np.clip(dot_product, -1.0, 1.0))\n                    angle_factor[i, j] = 1 - (angle / np.pi)\n    angle_factor_normalized = (angle_factor - np.min(angle_factor)) / (np.max(angle_factor) - np.min(angle_factor))\n\n    # --- Factor 3: Demand Consideration ---\n    demand_factor = np.ones((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j and i != 0 and j != 0:\n                demand_factor[i, j] = np.exp(- (demands[i] + demands[j]) / capacity)\n    demand_factor_normalized = (demand_factor - np.min(demand_factor)) / (np.max(demand_factor) - np.min(demand_factor))\n\n    # --- Adaptive Weights ---\n    weight_distance = 0.4\n    weight_angle = 0.3\n    weight_demand = 0.3\n\n    # --- Combined Heuristic ---\n    heuristic_matrix = (weight_distance * distance_factor_normalized +\n                        weight_angle * angle_factor_normalized +\n                        weight_demand * demand_factor_normalized)\n\n    # --- Sparsification ---\n    mean_distance = np.mean(distance_matrix[distance_matrix > 0])\n    distance_threshold = mean_distance * 1.5  # Adjusted threshold\n\n    heuristic_matrix[distance_matrix > distance_threshold] = 0\n    np.fill_diagonal(heuristic_matrix, 0)\n\n    # --- Distance-Scaled Randomness ---\n    randomness_factor = 0.01\n    random_matrix = np.random.rand(n, n) * randomness_factor * distance_factor\n\n    heuristic_matrix = heuristic_matrix + random_matrix\n\n    # --- Normalization ---\n    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristic_matrix)\n    if max_heuristic > 0:\n        heuristic_matrix = heuristic_matrix / max_heuristic\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\n[Better code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.\n    Improved version with normalized weights, adaptive sparsification, depot proximity, and distance-scaled randomness.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # Heuristic factors:\n    # 1.
