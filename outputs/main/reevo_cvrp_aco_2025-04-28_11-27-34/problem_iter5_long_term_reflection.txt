Emphasize multiplicative combinations of heuristics. Use adaptive sparsification informed by quantiles or thresholds relative to the maximum heuristic value. Incorporate depot proximity, angle calculations, and demand-capacity scaling. Introduce controlled randomness and consider Gaussian-like demand factors for robust edge selection.
