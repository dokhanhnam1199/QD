Weighting factors, adaptive sparsification, and depot proximity improve CVRP heuristic performance.

Weighting factors, explicit capacity ratio, and aggressive sparsification improve heuristic performance.

Consider savings, depot proximity, normalized distances, and thresholding relative to the maximum heuristic value.

Better code: Weighted factors, depot boosting, top-N sparsification improve heuristic quality and exploration.

Weight factors, adaptive sparsification, and depot proximity improve heuristic quality.

Tune factor weights, add more controlled randomness, and sparsify based on problem characteristics.

Multiplicative combination, randomness, and quantile-based sparsification improve heuristic performance. Normalization is also beneficial.

Consider angles, adaptive sparsification, multiplicative combination, and stochasticity for improved heuristic design.

Multiplicative combination, depot-focused angles, adaptive distance thresholds, and demand-capacity scaling are beneficial.

Better heuristics use global angle information, stochasticity, adaptive sparsification, and Gaussian-like demand factors.
