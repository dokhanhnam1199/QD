    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using a combination of factors.
    Improved version with normalized weights, adaptive sparsification, depot proximity, and distance-scaled randomness.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Demand of each customer (n).
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).
