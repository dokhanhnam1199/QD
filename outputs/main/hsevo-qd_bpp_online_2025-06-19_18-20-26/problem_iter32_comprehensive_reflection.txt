Okay, let's redefine self-reflection for better heuristic design, specifically avoiding the pitfalls outlined in "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Problem State, Dynamic Adaptation, Granularity, Performance Evaluation, Edge Case Analysis.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize fine-grained problem state analysis to inform dynamic parameter adjustments. Implement a robust performance evaluation framework with edge case testing and performance metrics.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of known strategies without problem-state awareness. Avoid fixed penalties or bonuses without dynamic adjustment.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on designing heuristics that intelligently react to nuances in the problem instance. Test comprehensively and avoid pre-determined weights.
