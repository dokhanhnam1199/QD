    An enhanced priority function for online bin packing that combines
    best-fit considerations with dynamic waste management, bin balancing,
    and a learning component.  It prioritizes bins based on a weighted
    combination of several factors, including space utilization,
    waste minimization, and bin balancing.  The weights are adjusted
    dynamically based on the overall fill level of the bins. This version includes
    a more sophisticated waste penalty and dynamic adjustment of the best-fit component.
