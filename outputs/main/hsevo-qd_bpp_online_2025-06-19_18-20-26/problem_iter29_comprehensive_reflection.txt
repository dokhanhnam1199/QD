Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multi-Factorial, Problem-Aware.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to the problem state by adjusting parameters and combining multiple relevant factors (e.g., best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing). Use feedback from the problem state to refine decisions.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single strategies, static parameter settings, neglecting edge cases, or failing to normalize factors.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require adaptability. Weights, penalties, and the influence of different factors should change based on the current state of the problem to refine the search process and improve overall performance.
