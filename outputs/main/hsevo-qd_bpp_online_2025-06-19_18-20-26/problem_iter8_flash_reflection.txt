**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, and an adaptive component that gives bonus to almost full bins, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. (2nd) to (4th) are identical to the best. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the best includes an adaptive component based on overall utilization that adjust fullness bonus, (5th) only has  best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing. Comparing (5th) vs (17th), (5th) includes best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, while (17th) only calculates log ratios. Comparing (8th) vs (17th), (8th) adds small constant to size_diff and uses more params.

Overall:

1.  **Multi-faceted Prioritization:** Top heuristics combine multiple factors like best-fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing.
2.  **Adaptive Strategies:** Dynamic adjustment of parameters (e.g., utilization penalty, fullness bonus) based on overall bin fill levels improves performance.
3. **Fine-grained Control**: Introduce params like `size_diff_epsilon`, `small_waste_penalty_factor`, `extreme_utilization_penalty_factor`, `target_utilization` to provide a fine-grained control to users.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics for bin packing involve a blend of best-fit strategies, waste reduction, and balanced bin utilization. Adaptive parameter adjustments based on the current state of the bins can significantly enhance performance. Also giving fine-grained control is very useful for design better heuristics.
