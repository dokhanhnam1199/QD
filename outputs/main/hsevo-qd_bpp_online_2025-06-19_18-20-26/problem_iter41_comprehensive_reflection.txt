Okay, I understand. To redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better bin packing heuristics, focusing on *avoiding* the pitfalls illustrated in the "Ineffective self-reflection" examples, we need a more targeted and insightful approach. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** *Systematic Exploration*, *Quantitative Evaluation*, *Iterative Refinement*, *Problem-Specific Adaptation*, *Performance Bottleneck Analysis*.

*   **Advice:** Focus on designing experiments to *quantitatively* measure the impact of each component of your heuristic. Then prioritize adapting components that most improve performance. Design explicit tests to identify weakness and improve that part.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "combining factors," "adaptive parameters," or "handling edge cases" without specific plans for implementation, evaluation, or iteration. Also, avoid focusing on "multiple relevant factors". Also, *avoid* intuitive judgements over empirical data.

*   **Explanation:** Instead of generally saying "use adaptive parameters," define *how* the parameters will be adapted (e.g., a specific formula based on bin fill ratios), *why* that specific adaptation is expected to improve performance (a hypothesis), and *how* you will measure whether the adaptation actually achieves its goal (a controlled experiment).
