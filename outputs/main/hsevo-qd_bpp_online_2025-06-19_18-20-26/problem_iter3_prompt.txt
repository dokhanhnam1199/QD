Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function incorporates several heuristics:\n\n    1.  **First Fit Decreasing (FFD) Approximation:** Bins closer in size to the item\n        (but still large enough) get higher priority.  This approximates the FFD\n        algorithm which is known to be reasonably effective.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization:**  Penalizes bins where the item leaves a very small\n        remaining capacity (high waste). This is crucial in online scenarios where\n        future items might fit perfectly into larger waste spaces.\n\n    3.  **Bin Utilization Balance:** Bins that are very empty or almost full are\n        slightly penalized to encourage mid-range utilization, promoting a more\n        balanced distribution of items across bins. This aims to avoid creating\n        bins that are almost full with one item.\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1. First Fit Decreasing Approximation (size proximity)\n    size_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    priorities = 1.0 / (size_diff + 0.0001)  # Avoid division by zero and give preference to bins closest to item size. Small constant added to size_diff\n\n    # Consider only bins with sufficient capacity\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priorities[~valid_bins] = -np.inf\n\n    # 2. Waste Minimization Penalty\n    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item\n    small_waste_penalty = np.exp(-10 * remaining_after_fit)\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= small_waste_penalty[valid_bins]\n\n    # 3. Bin Utilization Balance Penalty (U-shaped utilization preference)\n    utilization = (1 - (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)))  # Fraction full, range [0, 1] where 1 is empty and 0 is full\n    extreme_utilization_penalty = 10 * np.abs(utilization - 0.5) # Penalize bins that have utilization far from 0.5 (half full)\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= extreme_utilization_penalty[valid_bins]\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more actionable and avoid pitfalls that render self-reflection ineffective for designing better heuristics.\n\nHere's a revised definition, focusing on practical application and deeper analysis:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Heuristic Design, Critical Analysis, Performance Evaluation, Adaptive Improvement.\n*   **Advice:** Rigorously test heuristics across diverse datasets, analyze failure modes, and iteratively refine based on performance data. Consider adaptive mechanisms to adjust parameters during execution.\n*   **Avoid:** Relying solely on intuition or limited testing; neglecting performance analysis of individual heuristic components.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply \"considering\" factors to actively *measuring* their impact. Focus on data-driven refinement and dynamic adjustment of heuristic strategies.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
