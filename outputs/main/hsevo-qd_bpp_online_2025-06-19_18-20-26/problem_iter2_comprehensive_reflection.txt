Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more actionable and avoid pitfalls that render self-reflection ineffective for designing better heuristics.

Here's a revised definition, focusing on practical application and deeper analysis:

*   **Keywords:** Heuristic Design, Critical Analysis, Performance Evaluation, Adaptive Improvement.
*   **Advice:** Rigorously test heuristics across diverse datasets, analyze failure modes, and iteratively refine based on performance data. Consider adaptive mechanisms to adjust parameters during execution.
*   **Avoid:** Relying solely on intuition or limited testing; neglecting performance analysis of individual heuristic components.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply "considering" factors to actively *measuring* their impact. Focus on data-driven refinement and dynamic adjustment of heuristic strategies.
