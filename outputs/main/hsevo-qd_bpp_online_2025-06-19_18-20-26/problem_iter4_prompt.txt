This approximates the FFD\n        algorithm which is known to be reasonably effective.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization:**  Penalizes bins where the item leaves a very small\n        remaining capacity (high waste). This is crucial in online scenarios where\n        future items might fit perfectly into larger waste spaces.\n\n    3.  **Bin Utilization Balance:** Bins that are very empty or almost full are\n        slightly penalized to encourage mid-range utilization, promoting a more\n        balanced distribution of items across bins. This aims to avoid creating\n        bins that are almost full with one item.\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

Bin Utilization Balance Penalty (U-shaped utilization preference)\n    utilization = (1 - (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)))  # Fraction full, range [0, 1] where 1 is empty and 0 is full\n    extreme_utilization_penalty = 10 * np.abs(utilization - 0.5) # Penalize bins that have utilization far from 0.5 (half full)\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= extreme_utilization_penalty[valid_bins]\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation.
