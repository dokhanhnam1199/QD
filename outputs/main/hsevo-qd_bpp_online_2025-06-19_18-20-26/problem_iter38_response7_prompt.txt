The better heuristics incorporate adaptive components and dynamic adjustments based on overall bin utilization and item size.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see similar trends as (1st) vs (20th). The second-best heuristic also employs a combination of best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and fullness bonus, and it includes adaptive weight adjustments. In contrast, the second worst (19th) only considers item size ratios and waste minimization, lacking bin balancing and dynamic adaptation.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical. This suggests that the performance difference lies in other parts of the bin-packing algorithm, or that the test cases don't distinguish these two heuristics.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical. This could indicate code duplication, or simply that the changes between them have no effect on the test dataset.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the 19th includes waste minimization while the 20th does not.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe successful heuristics combine multiple factors (best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, fullness), and dynamically adjust weights based on bin utilization, item sizes, and/or capacity distribution. Less successful heuristics are simpler, focusing only on a subset of these factors, and without dynamic adjustments. Edge case handling is also important (handling nearly full bins or cases where no bin is suitable).\nThe ranking suggests that a good heuristic should aim for a balance between different objectives instead of focusing too much on a single criterion. Also, adaptability, and edge case handling are key.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding pitfalls.\n\nHere's a redefined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multifaceted, Problem State, Edge Cases, Normalization, Performance Feedback, Exploration vs. Exploitation, Computational Cost.\n\n*   **Advice:** Develop heuristics that actively learn and adapt to the problem instance *during* execution. Experiment with diverse features (e.g., item size distributions, bin utilization). Integrate performance feedback loops to continuously refine parameter weights. Employ both exploration and exploitation for better results.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, reliance solely on single strategies, ignoring edge cases, premature simplification, and neglecting computational cost.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design is an iterative process. Start with a robust, multifaceted heuristic, and refine it using real-time feedback. Dynamic adaptation allows the heuristic to tailor its behavior to the specific problem instance, avoiding the limitations of static or overly simplistic approaches.\n\n**Step-by-step thought process summary**\n1.  **Start with Keywords:** Identify the most crucial elements: Adaptability, dynamism, and considering the problem state.\n2.  **Provide Specific Advice:** Go beyond general statements. Suggest active learning, feature experimentation, and feedback loops.\n3.  **List What to Avoid:** Explicitly state what hinders good heuristic design (static parameters, ignoring edge cases, etc.).\n4.  **Summarize with Explanation:** Concisely explain the rationale behind the advice. Emphasize the iterative and adaptive nature of the process.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
