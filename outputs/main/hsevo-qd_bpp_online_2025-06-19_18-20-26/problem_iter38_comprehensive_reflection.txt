Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on avoiding pitfalls.

Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multifaceted, Problem State, Edge Cases, Normalization, Performance Feedback, Exploration vs. Exploitation, Computational Cost.

*   **Advice:** Develop heuristics that actively learn and adapt to the problem instance *during* execution. Experiment with diverse features (e.g., item size distributions, bin utilization). Integrate performance feedback loops to continuously refine parameter weights. Employ both exploration and exploitation for better results.

*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, reliance solely on single strategies, ignoring edge cases, premature simplification, and neglecting computational cost.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design is an iterative process. Start with a robust, multifaceted heuristic, and refine it using real-time feedback. Dynamic adaptation allows the heuristic to tailor its behavior to the specific problem instance, avoiding the limitations of static or overly simplistic approaches.

**Step-by-step thought process summary**
1.  **Start with Keywords:** Identify the most crucial elements: Adaptability, dynamism, and considering the problem state.
2.  **Provide Specific Advice:** Go beyond general statements. Suggest active learning, feature experimentation, and feedback loops.
3.  **List What to Avoid:** Explicitly state what hinders good heuristic design (static parameters, ignoring edge cases, etc.).
4.  **Summarize with Explanation:** Concisely explain the rationale behind the advice. Emphasize the iterative and adaptive nature of the process.
