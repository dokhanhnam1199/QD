**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing and adaptive bonus and the worst one only uses log ratios.
*   (2nd) vs (19th): Similar to above.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the best heuristic includes dynamic waste management, adaptive parameter tuning and edge case handling while the second one does not. The first one also dynamically adjusts the small waste penalty strength based on item size.
*   (3rd) vs (4th): The third one incorporates an adaptive waste penalty adjustment for large items when the overall utilization is high.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst has the same implementation but more import statements.
*   Comparing (15th) vs (16th): (15th) adds a penalty for over-utilized bins, scaling waste minimization with item size and dynamic bin balancing while (16th) lacks these features. (16th) also has a simpler waste minimization calculation without scaling with item size. (16th) has no dynamic adjustment in bin balancing
*   Comparing (1st) vs (6th): The first heuristic incorporates dynamic waste management and adaptive tuning and adaptive waste thresholding while the other includes dynamic penalty adjustment, adaptive weighting and normalization. The first one incorporates Edge Case Handling while the (6th) one has Item-Size-Aware Adjustment.
*   (10th) vs (11th): The tenth one is the same as the eleventh.
*   Overall: The better heuristics include more adaptive components (dynamic waste management, adaptive parameter tuning, adaptive weighting), handle edge cases, and normalize priorities to prevent single factor domination. Simpler heuristics primarily rely on basic best-fit and waste minimization, lacking dynamic adjustments.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, consider incorporating adaptive components that dynamically adjust weights and parameters based on real-time feedback and historical performance. Also, think about handling edge cases, normalizing priorities and scaling penalties based on item sizes and overall utilization.
