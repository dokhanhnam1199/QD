Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the 3rd one introduces adaptive parameters for waste minimization and bin balancing, along with edge case handling for nearly full bins and adjusts the best-fit component to favour bins closer to being full. It also uses `waste_penalty_strength = 10 + 5 * item` to adjust the waste penalty. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic 3 contains more adaptive logic. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), we see they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the 6th heuristic adaptively adjusts the waste penalty based on item size and overall utilization. Comparing (1st) vs (7th), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (8th), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (9th), heuristic 9 uses both `small_waste_penalty` and `large_waste_penalty`. Comparing (9th) vs (10th), we see they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), heuristic 11 introduces a stronger best-fit component and adaptive waste minimization, scaling the penalty with both item size and remaining space. Comparing (1st) vs (12th), heuristic 12 dynamically adjusts the strategy based on item size relative to bin capacities and overall bin utilization. It adjusts best fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing based on these factors. Comparing (1st) vs (13th), we see heuristic 13 adaptively adjust best-fit using granularity factor and dynamic waste minimization using `item_size_factor`. Comparing (13th) vs (14th), they are identical. Comparing (1st) vs (15th), we see heuristic 15 introduces `Over-utilization penalty` for almost-full bins. Comparing (1st) vs (16th), the 16th heuristic introduces item-size-aware adjustment. Comparing (1st) vs (17th), the 17th heuristic explores using a new bin even if the current bin has space. Comparing (1st) vs (18th), the 18th heuristic strongly emphasizes best fit decreasing, scaling waste minimization with item size. Comparing (1st) vs (19th), heuristic 19 uses FFD approximation. Comparing (1st) vs (20th), the 20th heuristic uses bias toward full bins, dynamic target utilization and random component to break ties. Overall: The better heuristics tend to have more adaptive components, adjusting weights and strategies based on item size, bin utilization, and other problem-specific factors. They also incorporate edge case handling and exploration strategies to avoid local optima.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to \"Current Self-Reflection,\" designed to improve your heuristic design process:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Dynamic Adaptation, Multi-Factor Integration, Problem State Awareness, Robustness, Edge Case Handling, Normalization, Feedback Loops, Exploration, Diversification, Bin Utilization, Item Size Impact.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on designing heuristics that *react* to the problem. Implement feedback loops where the algorithm learns from its actions (e.g., high waste, unbalanced bins) and adjusts its parameters accordingly. Explicitly consider edge cases to avoid brittle solutions.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Broad, generic statements like \"combine multiple factors\" without specifying *how* and *why*. Avoid simply stating obvious goals like \"minimize waste\" without actionable strategies for achieving them in a *dynamic* and *adaptive* manner. Avoid vague notions of complexity.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply listing desirable qualities, your self-reflection should focus on the *mechanisms* through which these qualities can be achieved. For example, instead of saying \"balance bin utilization,\" consider *how* you will dynamically adjust placement strategies based on observed bin fill levels. Focus on strategies for escaping local optima.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
