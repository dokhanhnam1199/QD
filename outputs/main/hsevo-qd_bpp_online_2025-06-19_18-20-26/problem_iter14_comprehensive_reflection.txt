Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection" and aiming for actionable insights.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive heuristics, dynamic adjustment, multiple factors, robust handling, normalization, scaling, feedback.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to problem state through feedback mechanisms. Integrate relevant factors with thoughtful weighting and normalization.
*   **Avoid:** Generic statements about "best-fit strategies" without specifying *how* they adapt or integrate. Avoid focusing solely on bin packing specifics if you seek general principles.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply *stating* the need for adaptation; focus on the *mechanisms* by which adaptation happens (e.g., real-time performance data, input characteristics). Prioritize adaptability and robust handling.
