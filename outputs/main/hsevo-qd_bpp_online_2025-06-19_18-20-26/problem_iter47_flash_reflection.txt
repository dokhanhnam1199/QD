**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and adaptive weights, while the worst uses only the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.
*   Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see that the second-best heuristic incorporates adaptive adjustments and problem-state awareness. In contrast, the second-worst heuristic combines FFD approximation, waste minimization, and capacity ratio but lacks adaptive weighting.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we don't see any differences because they're exactly the same.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we don't see any differences because they're exactly the same.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst adds waste minimization. Overall: adaptive weights and dynamic adjustments based on problem state appear crucial for superior performance. Best-fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing are common components. Simpler heuristics that only consider capacity ratios tend to perform worse. Furthermore, edge case handling and diversification are also valuable. Normalizing the final priorities is important for stable and comparable results.

**Experience:**
A successful heuristic for bin packing requires a multi-faceted approach considering best-fit, waste, and bin balance. Dynamic parameter adjustment based on problem state (e.g., overall utilization) is critical. Normalization helps avoid domination by individual factors, and edge case handling enhances robustness.
