Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,\n                size_diff_epsilon: float = 0.0004976631192414565,\n                small_waste_penalty_factor: float = 13.759620087105052,\n                extreme_utilization_penalty_factor: float = 10.96255884116071,\n                target_utilization: float = 0.2781292500038949) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function incorporates several heuristics:\n\n    1.  **First Fit Decreasing (FFD) Approximation:** Bins closer in size to the item\n        (but still large enough) get higher priority.  This approximates the FFD\n        algorithm which is known to be reasonably effective.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization:**  Penalizes bins where the item leaves a very small\n        remaining capacity (high waste). This is crucial in online scenarios where\n        future items might fit perfectly into larger waste spaces.\n\n    3.  **Bin Utilization Balance:** Bins that are very empty or almost full are\n        slightly penalized to encourage mid-range utilization, promoting a more\n        balanced distribution of items across bins.

Aims for optimal space utilization\n       in each bin, reducing fragmentation.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization (Adaptive):**  Penalizes small waste, but the penalty *scales*\n        with item size.  Large items creating small waste are penalized more heavily, as\n        that waste is harder to fill later.\n\n    3.  **Bin Balancing (Dynamic):**  Adjusts the utilization penalty based on the *overall*\n        fill level of all bins.

(2nd) vs (19th), the same situation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical too. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are also identical, focusing only on a simple ratio. Comparing (8th) vs (11th), we observe the 8th employs a more complex and adaptive strategy, including Best Fit Decreasing emphasis, adaptive waste minimization (scaling with item size), dynamic bin balancing (adjusting penalties based on overall fill level), and a penalty for over-utilized bins. The 11th uses standard FFD, waste minimization, and bin utilization, without the adaptive elements. Comparing (8th) vs (9th), we observe they are identical. Comparing (16th) vs (17th), 16th combines FFD, capacity ratio, and waste minimization, while the 17th only uses a simple log ratio. Overall: The best heuristics combine multiple factors (FFD or BFD, waste minimization, utilization balance) and often include adaptive elements that adjust behavior based on item size or overall bin state, whereas worse ones rely on simpler ratios and lack adaptability or multiple considerations.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Contextual, Iterative, Feedback-driven.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that learn from each iteration and adapt their parameters/strategies based on problem-specific context and performance feedback.\n*   **Avoid:** Static, rigid heuristics; \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches; ignoring problem-specific characteristics.\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of fixed rules, aim for heuristics that iteratively refine their behavior by analyzing the problem's landscape and learning from past mistakes.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
