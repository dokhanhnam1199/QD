{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and dynamically adjusting their weights based on the current state. Adaptive penalties and bonuses are useful for refining the search. Normalizing priorities can prevent any single factor from dominating.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and combine them thoughtfully. Prioritize known effective strategies like FFD. Address edge cases explicitly to ensure robustness. Normalizing and scaling the factors properly can enhance the final combined heuristic.\n\nEffective heuristic design requires integrating multiple relevant factors and adapting strategies based on the problem's current state. Prioritize approaches that dynamically adjust parameters and penalties based on feedback from the environment or characteristics of the input data. Simpler heuristics can serve as a baseline, but richer models are generally required for high-quality solutions.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for bin packing involve a blend of best-fit strategies, waste reduction, and balanced bin utilization. Adaptive parameter adjustments based on the current state of the bins can significantly enhance performance. Also giving fine-grained control is very useful for design better heuristics.\n\nEffective heuristics for bin packing require a multifaceted approach combining best-fit strategies, waste management, and bin balancing. Adaptive adjustments based on overall fill levels and item sizes can significantly improve performance. Prioritizing tight fits and penalizing small waste are key considerations.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider incorporating adaptive components that dynamically adjust weights and parameters based on real-time feedback and historical performance. Also, think about handling edge cases, normalizing priorities and scaling penalties based on item sizes and overall utilization.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
