Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, dynamic adjustment, multi-factor integration, state-dependent penalties/bonuses.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently combine multiple factors, dynamically adjusting their influence based on the current problem state or search trajectory. Prioritize real-time feedback mechanisms to inform these adjustments.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "combining factors" without specifying *how* or the *basis* for adjustment. Avoid generic advice like "consider edge cases" without concrete examples.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection should lead to implementable design principles. This means moving beyond generalities to concrete strategies for incorporating adaptability and state-awareness into heuristic design.
