Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Normalization, Edge Cases, Integration, Feedback.

*   **Advice:** Focus on developing heuristics that adapt dynamically based on real-time feedback and input data characteristics. Integrate multiple relevant factors thoughtfully. Normalize and scale inputs appropriately. Explicitly handle edge cases.

*   **Avoid:** Generic statements about "best-fit," "waste reduction," or "bin balancing" without specifying how to achieve them adaptively. Avoid vague notions of "fine-grained control."

*   **Explanation:** Instead of stating obvious principles, concentrate on *mechanisms* for adapting heuristic parameters and weights based on the problem state. This requires analyzing the current solution and adjusting strategies accordingly.
