Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    An enhanced priority function for online bin packing that combines\n    best-fit considerations with dynamic waste management, bin balancing,\n    and a learning component.

(2nd best) vs (19th) have the same differences. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one has waste penalty adjustment. (3rd) vs (4th) shows similar pattern. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the core logic is same. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors such as best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing and fullness, and often adjust the weights of these factors dynamically based on the overall fill level and item sizes. They tend to include adaptive components and penalties for over-utilization. Simpler ones only focus on the ratio.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, dynamic adjustment, multi-factor integration, state-dependent penalties/bonuses.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently combine multiple factors, dynamically adjusting their influence based on the current problem state or search trajectory. Prioritize real-time feedback mechanisms to inform these adjustments.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about \"combining factors\" without specifying *how* or the *basis* for adjustment. Avoid generic advice like \"consider edge cases\" without concrete examples.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection should lead to implementable design principles. This means moving beyond generalities to concrete strategies for incorporating adaptability and state-awareness into heuristic design.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
