**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and fullness bonus, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity. The better heuristics incorporate adaptive components and dynamic adjustments based on overall bin utilization and item size.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see similar trends as (1st) vs (20th). The second-best heuristic also employs a combination of best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and fullness bonus, and it includes adaptive weight adjustments. In contrast, the second worst (19th) only considers item size ratios and waste minimization, lacking bin balancing and dynamic adaptation.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical. This suggests that the performance difference lies in other parts of the bin-packing algorithm, or that the test cases don't distinguish these two heuristics.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical. This could indicate code duplication, or simply that the changes between them have no effect on the test dataset.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the 19th includes waste minimization while the 20th does not.

Overall:

The successful heuristics combine multiple factors (best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, fullness), and dynamically adjust weights based on bin utilization, item sizes, and/or capacity distribution. Less successful heuristics are simpler, focusing only on a subset of these factors, and without dynamic adjustments. Edge case handling is also important (handling nearly full bins or cases where no bin is suitable).
The ranking suggests that a good heuristic should aim for a balance between different objectives instead of focusing too much on a single criterion. Also, adaptability, and edge case handling are key.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors, and dynamically adjust their weights based on the problem state. Consider edge cases and normalize the priorities. Include adaptive components which respond to overall utilization and item sizes.
