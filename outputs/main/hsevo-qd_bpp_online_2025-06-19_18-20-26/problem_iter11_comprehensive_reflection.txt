Okay, let's refine "current self-reflection" to be more actionable and targeted for designing better bin packing heuristics, while specifically avoiding the pitfalls of "ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a redefinition focused on *actionable insights* derived from careful consideration of the *current state* and *learning from failures*.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, dynamic, feedback-driven, state-dependent, multi-faceted, edge-case handling, normalization, penalty-adjustment, learning, failure-analysis.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that react intelligently to the *specific* characteristics of the *current* bin state and incoming items. Use real-time feedback (e.g., waste metrics, bin fullness distribution) to *dynamically* adjust parameters (e.g., priorities of different fitting strategies, penalty weights for wasted space).

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "best-fit strategies" or "waste reduction" *without specifying the precise conditions under which they are most effective and how those conditions are detected*. Avoid assuming "fine-grained control" inherently leads to better heuristics; focus on *purposeful* control driven by *measurable* improvements.

*   **Explanation:** A good heuristic doesn't just *use* multiple factors; it *intelligently weighs and combines* them based on the *current context*. It learns from its failures (i.e., when does best-fit actually lead to more waste later?). This requires analyzing failures, identifying patterns, and incorporating rules to avoid repeating those failures in similar situations. Dynamic adjustments based on state allow for more robust performance across various input distributions.
