Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines adaptive waste minimization and bin balancing with best fit.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priorities[~valid_bins] = -np.inf\n\n    size_diff = bins_remain_cap - item\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 / (size_diff[valid_bins] + 0.0001)**2\n\n    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item\n    small_waste_penalty = np.exp(-10 * remaining_after_fit * item)\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= small_waste_penalty[valid_bins]\n\n    utilization = 1 - (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap))\n    overall_utilization = np.mean(utilization)\n\n    if overall_utilization < 0.3:\n        extreme_utilization_penalty = 5 * np.abs(utilization - 0.2)\n    elif overall_utilization > 0.7:\n        extreme_utilization_penalty = 15 * np.abs(utilization - 0.8)\n    else:\n        extreme_utilization_penalty = 10 * np.abs(utilization - 0.5)\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= extreme_utilization_penalty[valid_bins]\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function incorporates several heuristics, with refinements over v1:\n\n    1. **Best Fit Decreasing (BFD) Emphasis:**  Prioritizes bins that offer the *tightest* fit\n       for the current item, more aggressively than v1. Aims for optimal space utilization\n       in each bin, reducing fragmentation.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization (Adaptive):**  Penalizes small waste, but the penalty *scales*\n        with item size.  Large items creating small waste are penalized more heavily, as\n        that waste is harder to fill later.\n\n    3.  **Bin Balancing (Dynamic):**  Adjusts the utilization penalty based on the *overall*\n        fill level of all bins. If bins are generally empty, encourages filling them more;\n        if bins are generally full, focuses on avoiding small waste.\n\n    4. **Penalty for Over-Utilized Bins:** Add a bigger penalty if bins are almost full before placing the current item.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

(2nd) to (4th) are identical to the best. Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the best includes an adaptive component based on overall utilization that adjust fullness bonus, (5th) only has  best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing. Comparing (5th) vs (17th), (5th) includes best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, while (17th) only calculates log ratios. Comparing (8th) vs (17th), (8th) adds small constant to size_diff and uses more params.\n\nOverall:\n\n1.  **Multi-faceted Prioritization:** Top heuristics combine multiple factors like best-fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing.\n2.  **Adaptive Strategies:** Dynamic adjustment of parameters (e.g., utilization penalty, fullness bonus) based on overall bin fill levels improves performance.\n3. **Fine-grained Control**: Introduce params like `size_diff_epsilon`, `small_waste_penalty_factor`, `extreme_utilization_penalty_factor`, `target_utilization` to provide a fine-grained control to users.\n- \nHere's a refined perspective on \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable strategies:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, dynamic parameter tuning, factor integration, edge-case handling.\n\n*   **Advice:** Emphasize real-time adjustment of heuristic parameters based on ongoing performance feedback and problem-specific traits.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static, pre-defined parameters and a sole reliance on existing strategies without adaptation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Continuous monitoring and adaptation mechanisms are crucial. Design heuristics to learn and adjust during execution, refining their effectiveness.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
