Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Aims for optimal space utilization\n       in each bin, reducing fragmentation.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization (Adaptive):**  Penalizes small waste, but the penalty *scales*\n        with item size.  Large items creating small waste are penalized more heavily, as\n        that waste is harder to fill later.\n\n    3.  **Bin Balancing (Dynamic):**  Adjusts the utilization penalty based on the *overall*\n        fill level of all bins. If bins are generally empty, encourages filling them more;\n        if bins are generally full, focuses on avoiding small waste.\n\n    4. **Penalty for Over-Utilized Bins:** Add a bigger penalty if bins are almost full before placing the current item.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar trend, with the adaptive components being absent in the second worst. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the docstrings are almost exactly identical, indicating that the difference lies within minor implementation details or parameter choices. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals a shift towards including item-size awareness, suggesting this is a key improvement. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the simple calculation based on log ratios struggles in performance due to lack of waste management and bin balancing. Overall: Better heuristics incorporate multiple factors and adapt their behavior based on the current state of the bins and the item being packed. Adaptive weighting, dynamic waste thresholding, and item-size awareness are recurring themes in the top-performing heuristics.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine self-reflection for better heuristic design, specifically avoiding the pitfalls outlined in \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Problem State, Dynamic Adaptation, Granularity, Performance Evaluation, Edge Case Analysis.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize fine-grained problem state analysis to inform dynamic parameter adjustments. Implement a robust performance evaluation framework with edge case testing and performance metrics.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic combinations of known strategies without problem-state awareness. Avoid fixed penalties or bonuses without dynamic adjustment.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on designing heuristics that intelligently react to nuances in the problem instance. Test comprehensively and avoid pre-determined weights.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
