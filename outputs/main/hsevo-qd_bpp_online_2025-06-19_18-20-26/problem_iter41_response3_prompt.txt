Aims for optimal space utilization\n       in each bin, reducing fragmentation.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization (Adaptive):**  Penalizes small waste, but the penalty *scales*\n        with item size.  Large items creating small waste are penalized more heavily, as\n        that waste is harder to fill later.\n\n    3.  **Bin Balancing (Dynamic):**  Adjusts the utilization penalty based on the *overall*\n        fill level of all bins. If bins are generally empty, encourages filling them more;\n        if bins are generally full, focuses on avoiding small waste.\n\n    4. **Penalty for Over-Utilized Bins:** Add a bigger penalty if bins are almost full before placing the current item.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

(2nd best) vs (19th), the second best uses best-fit, waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, and adaptive fullness bonus, while the 19th only uses FFD approximation and waste minimization. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see similar functionality but the comments are more descriptive in the second heuristic. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both combine best-fit considerations with dynamic waste management, bin balancing, and learning, however, the third makes small adjustments to the best-fit to encourage more full bins. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst implements waste minimization, first fit approximation, and bin balancing, while the worst one just implements a ratio. Overall: the better heuristics include more components such as best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing and fullness, while the worse heuristics only consider a few components. Better heuristics use adaptive methods to dynamically adjust their weighting and parameters. Better heuristics include comprehensive edge case handling.\n- \nOkay, I understand. To redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better bin packing heuristics, focusing on *avoiding* the pitfalls illustrated in the \"Ineffective self-reflection\" examples, we need a more targeted and insightful approach. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** *Systematic Exploration*, *Quantitative Evaluation*, *Iterative Refinement*, *Problem-Specific Adaptation*, *Performance Bottleneck Analysis*.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on designing experiments to *quantitatively* measure the impact of each component of your heuristic. Then prioritize adapting components that most improve performance. Design explicit tests to identify weakness and improve that part.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about \"combining factors,\" \"adaptive parameters,\" or \"handling edge cases\" without specific plans for implementation, evaluation, or iteration. Also, avoid focusing on \"multiple relevant factors\". Also, *avoid* intuitive judgements over empirical data.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of generally saying \"use adaptive parameters,\" define *how* the parameters will be adapted (e.g., a specific formula based on bin fill ratios), *why* that specific adaptation is expected to improve performance (a hypothesis), and *how* you will measure whether the adaptation actually achieves its goal (a controlled experiment).\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
