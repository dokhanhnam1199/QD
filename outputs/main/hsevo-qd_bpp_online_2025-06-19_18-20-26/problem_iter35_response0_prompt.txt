Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) introduces an adaptive waste penalty adjustment and a penalty for over-utilized bins, making it slightly more sophisticated than (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) incorporates utilization awareness into its waste minimization component through `waste_penalty_factor`.\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see very similar approaches, with minor variations in how the ratio is handled. Overall: The better heuristics involve a more complex and adaptive combination of factors, especially regarding dynamic waste management, bin balancing, and fullness bonuses, with the parameters of these factors often depending on overall bin utilization and item sizes. The worst perform much simpler calculations using ratios.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflection.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multifaceted, State-Aware, Evaluation Metrics, Iterative Refinement.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics as learning systems. Incorporate feedback loops using clearly defined evaluation metrics at each step to refine parameters and strategies. Think of heuristics as \"policies\" that adapt to different problem stages or instances.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about \"combining factors\" without specifying *how* the combination happens, focusing solely on existing strategies without exploring new combinations, ignoring the computational cost of adaptation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves quantifying the impact of design choices on heuristic performance. It uses data-driven evaluation to iteratively refine the heuristic's behavior. The reflection is not merely descriptive (\"combine multiple factors\") but prescriptive (\"adjust weight X based on performance metric Y\").\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
