Okay, here's a redefined approach to "Current Self-Reflection," designed to avoid the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection," and to guide the design of better heuristics.

*   **Keywords:** Dynamic adaptation, state-awareness, multi-objective, normalization, feedback-driven, robust edge-case handling, computational efficiency.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that actively monitor problem state and dynamically adjust parameters (weights, penalties, strategies) accordingly. Combine multiple objectives (e.g., best-fit *and* waste reduction) via adaptive weighting. Incorporate feedback loops (e.g. historical performance).

*   **Avoid:** Static parameter tuning, reliance on single strategies, neglecting edge cases, excessive complexity without commensurate performance gains, ignoring computational cost.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond static rules. Focus on heuristics that *learn* and adapt within the problem-solving process. Normalizing objectives prevents domination and ensures fair consideration. Prioritize computationally efficient adaptation mechanisms.
