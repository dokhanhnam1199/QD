Here's a refined perspective on "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable strategies:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, dynamic parameter tuning, factor integration, edge-case handling.

*   **Advice:** Emphasize real-time adjustment of heuristic parameters based on ongoing performance feedback and problem-specific traits.

*   **Avoid:** Static, pre-defined parameters and a sole reliance on existing strategies without adaptation.

*   **Explanation:** Continuous monitoring and adaptation mechanisms are crucial. Design heuristics to learn and adjust during execution, refining their effectiveness.
