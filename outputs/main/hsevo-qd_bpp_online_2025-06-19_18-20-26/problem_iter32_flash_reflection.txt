**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic involves a complex combination of best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and adaptive bonuses, while the worst is a simple logarithmic ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar trend, with the adaptive components being absent in the second worst. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the docstrings are almost exactly identical, indicating that the difference lies within minor implementation details or parameter choices. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals a shift towards including item-size awareness, suggesting this is a key improvement. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the simple calculation based on log ratios struggles in performance due to lack of waste management and bin balancing. Overall: Better heuristics incorporate multiple factors and adapt their behavior based on the current state of the bins and the item being packed. Adaptive weighting, dynamic waste thresholding, and item-size awareness are recurring themes in the top-performing heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, adapt weights dynamically based on the problem state, and incorporate domain-specific knowledge like item size or bin fill level. Waste management and bin balancing appear crucial for the bin packing problem. Start with a complex approach, and simplify after.
