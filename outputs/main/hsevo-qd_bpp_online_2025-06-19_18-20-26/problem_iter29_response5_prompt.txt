Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

This approximates the FFD\n        algorithm which is known to be reasonably effective.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization:**  Penalizes bins where the item leaves a very small\n        remaining capacity (high waste). This is crucial in online scenarios where\n        future items might fit perfectly into larger waste spaces.\n\n    3.  **Bin Utilization Balance:** Bins that are very empty or almost full are\n        slightly penalized to encourage mid-range utilization, promoting a more\n        balanced distribution of items across bins. This aims to avoid creating\n        bins that are almost full with one item.\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

(2nd best) vs (2nd worst) are almost the same. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see only documentation different; (3rd) vs (4th) are almost the same; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see only documentation different; Overall: better heuristics incorporate more factors (best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, fullness bonus) and dynamically adjust weights based on problem state (item size, overall utilization). Also, robust heuristics handle edge cases gracefully.\n- \nOkay, here's a redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multi-Factorial, Problem-Aware.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to the problem state by adjusting parameters and combining multiple relevant factors (e.g., best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing). Use feedback from the problem state to refine decisions.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single strategies, static parameter settings, neglecting edge cases, or failing to normalize factors.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require adaptability. Weights, penalties, and the influence of different factors should change based on the current state of the problem to refine the search process and improve overall performance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
