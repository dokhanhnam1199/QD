Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Experiment with diverse features (e.g., item size distributions, bin utilization). Integrate performance feedback loops to continuously refine parameter weights. Employ both exploration and exploitation for better results.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Static parameters, reliance solely on single strategies, ignoring edge cases, premature simplification, and neglecting computational cost.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design is an iterative process. Start with a robust, multifaceted heuristic, and refine it using real-time feedback. Dynamic adaptation allows the heuristic to tailor its behavior to the specific problem instance, avoiding the limitations of static or overly simplistic approaches.\n\n**Step-by-step thought process summary**\n1.  **Start with Keywords:** Identify the most crucial elements: Adaptability, dynamism, and considering the problem state.\n2.  **Provide Specific Advice:** Go beyond general statements. Suggest active learning, feature experimentation, and feedback loops.\n3.  **List What to Avoid:** Explicitly state what hinders good heuristic design (static parameters, ignoring edge cases, etc.).\n4.  **Summarize with Explanation:** Concisely explain the rationale behind the advice. Emphasize the iterative and adaptive nature of the process.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
