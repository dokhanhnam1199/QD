Here's a redefined approach to "Current Self-Reflection," designed to improve your heuristic design process:

*   **Keywords:** Dynamic Adaptation, Multi-Factor Integration, Problem State Awareness, Robustness, Edge Case Handling, Normalization, Feedback Loops, Exploration, Diversification, Bin Utilization, Item Size Impact.

*   **Advice:** Focus on designing heuristics that *react* to the problem. Implement feedback loops where the algorithm learns from its actions (e.g., high waste, unbalanced bins) and adjusts its parameters accordingly. Explicitly consider edge cases to avoid brittle solutions.

*   **Avoid:** Broad, generic statements like "combine multiple factors" without specifying *how* and *why*. Avoid simply stating obvious goals like "minimize waste" without actionable strategies for achieving them in a *dynamic* and *adaptive* manner. Avoid vague notions of complexity.

*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply listing desirable qualities, your self-reflection should focus on the *mechanisms* through which these qualities can be achieved. For example, instead of saying "balance bin utilization," consider *how* you will dynamically adjust placement strategies based on observed bin fill levels. Focus on strategies for escaping local optima.
