**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers First Fit Decreasing (FFD) approximation, Waste Minimization, and Bin Utilization Balance, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity using a log transform. (2nd) vs (19th), the same situation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical too. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are also identical, focusing only on a simple ratio. Comparing (8th) vs (11th), we observe the 8th employs a more complex and adaptive strategy, including Best Fit Decreasing emphasis, adaptive waste minimization (scaling with item size), dynamic bin balancing (adjusting penalties based on overall fill level), and a penalty for over-utilized bins. The 11th uses standard FFD, waste minimization, and bin utilization, without the adaptive elements. Comparing (8th) vs (9th), we observe they are identical. Comparing (16th) vs (17th), 16th combines FFD, capacity ratio, and waste minimization, while the 17th only uses a simple log ratio. Overall: The best heuristics combine multiple factors (FFD or BFD, waste minimization, utilization balance) and often include adaptive elements that adjust behavior based on item size or overall bin state, whereas worse ones rely on simpler ratios and lack adaptability or multiple considerations.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristic design requires integrating multiple relevant factors and adapting strategies based on the problem's current state. Prioritize approaches that dynamically adjust parameters and penalties based on feedback from the environment or characteristics of the input data. Simpler heuristics can serve as a baseline, but richer models are generally required for high-quality solutions.
