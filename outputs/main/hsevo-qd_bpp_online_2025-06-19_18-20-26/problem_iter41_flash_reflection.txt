**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and adaptive fullness, while the 20th only uses a ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (19th), the second best uses best-fit, waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, and adaptive fullness bonus, while the 19th only uses FFD approximation and waste minimization. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see similar functionality but the comments are more descriptive in the second heuristic. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both combine best-fit considerations with dynamic waste management, bin balancing, and learning, however, the third makes small adjustments to the best-fit to encourage more full bins. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst implements waste minimization, first fit approximation, and bin balancing, while the worst one just implements a ratio. Overall: the better heuristics include more components such as best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing and fullness, while the worse heuristics only consider a few components. Better heuristics use adaptive methods to dynamically adjust their weighting and parameters. Better heuristics include comprehensive edge case handling.

**Experience:**
Better heuristics in bin packing involve a multi-faceted approach, combining best-fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing with dynamic adjustments based on fill levels and item sizes. Incorporating edge case handling and adaptive weighting enhances robustness and adaptability.
