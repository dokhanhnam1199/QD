**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, fullness bonus, and item-size awareness, along with adaptive parameter tuning and dynamic waste thresholding. The worst heuristic only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the second-best heuristic combines best-fit, waste minimization, adaptive bin balancing, and fullness bonus, adding an adaptive waste penalty adjustment based on item size and overall utilization. The second-worst heuristic only combines FFD approximation, waste minimization, and capacity ratio.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe that the best heuristic includes a more elaborate waste minimization strategy (adaptive threshold, dynamic penalty strength) and handles edge cases. The second-best heuristic uses a simpler, static waste minimization approach and lacks specific edge case handling but introduces item-size-aware waste penalty.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), there are no functional differences between the two.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second-worst heuristic, combines FFD approximation, waste minimization, and capacity ratio. The worst heuristic only calculates the negative log ratios of item size to bin capacity, which oversimplifies the problem and ignores waste and bin utilization.

Overall: The better heuristics prioritize a combination of factors: best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, fullness bonuses, and adaptive parameter tuning based on item size and overall bin utilization. Simpler heuristics that only focus on a single aspect (e.g., capacity ratio) perform worse. Dynamically adapting parameters based on the current state of the bin packing process appears to be key to improved performance. Penalizing extreme scenarios, such as very small wastes or nearly full bins, also helps.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors, such as best-fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing. Implement adaptive parameter tuning based on problem state. Avoid oversimplification and address edge cases. Waste minimization and penalizing extreme bin utilization are important for online bin packing.
