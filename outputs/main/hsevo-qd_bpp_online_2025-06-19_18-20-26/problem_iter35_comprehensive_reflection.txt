Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective reflection.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Multifaceted, State-Aware, Evaluation Metrics, Iterative Refinement.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics as learning systems. Incorporate feedback loops using clearly defined evaluation metrics at each step to refine parameters and strategies. Think of heuristics as "policies" that adapt to different problem stages or instances.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "combining factors" without specifying *how* the combination happens, focusing solely on existing strategies without exploring new combinations, ignoring the computational cost of adaptation.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves quantifying the impact of design choices on heuristic performance. It uses data-driven evaluation to iteratively refine the heuristic's behavior. The reflection is not merely descriptive ("combine multiple factors") but prescriptive ("adjust weight X based on performance metric Y").
