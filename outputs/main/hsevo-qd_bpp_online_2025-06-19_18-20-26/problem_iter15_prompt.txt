Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    An enhanced priority function for online bin packing that combines\n    best-fit considerations with dynamic waste management, bin balancing,\n    and a learning component.

Integrate relevant factors with thoughtful weighting and normalization.\n*   **Avoid:** Generic statements about \"best-fit strategies\" without specifying *how* they adapt or integrate. Avoid focusing solely on bin packing specifics if you seek general principles.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply *stating* the need for adaptation; focus on the *mechanisms* by which adaptation happens (e.g., real-time performance data, input characteristics). Prioritize adaptability and robust handling.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
