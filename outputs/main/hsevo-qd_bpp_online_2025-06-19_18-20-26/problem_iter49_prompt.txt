It prioritizes bins based on a weighted\n    combination of several factors, including space utilization,\n    waste minimization, and bin balancing.  The weights are adjusted\n    dynamically based on the overall fill level of the bins.

Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.\n\n- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\n- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```."}
