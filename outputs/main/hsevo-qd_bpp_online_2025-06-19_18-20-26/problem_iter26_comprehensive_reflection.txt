Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to focus on actionable advice for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive strategies, dynamic weighting, multi-factor integration, problem-state awareness, robustness, normalization, edge case handling, performance feedback, computational cost.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics that adapt to the problem state by dynamically adjusting parameters, weights, and penalties. Combine multiple relevant factors (e.g., best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing) thoughtfully. Explicitly address edge cases.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification without justification, static parameter settings, neglecting computational cost, allowing single factors to dominate the heuristic's behavior, ignoring performance feedback.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require balancing complexity and computational cost. Adaptive mechanisms are crucial, but normalization and performance monitoring are essential to ensure robustness and prevent unintended behavior.
