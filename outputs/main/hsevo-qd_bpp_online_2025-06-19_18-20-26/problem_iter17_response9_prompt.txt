Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,\n                size_diff_epsilon: float = 0.0004976631192414565,\n                small_waste_penalty_factor: float = 13.759620087105052,\n                extreme_utilization_penalty_factor: float = 10.96255884116071,\n                target_utilization: float = 0.2781292500038949) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function incorporates several heuristics:\n\n    1.  **First Fit Decreasing (FFD) Approximation:** Bins closer in size to the item\n        (but still large enough) get higher priority.  This approximates the FFD\n        algorithm which is known to be reasonably effective.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization:**  Penalizes bins where the item leaves a very small\n        remaining capacity (high waste). This is crucial in online scenarios where\n        future items might fit perfectly into larger waste spaces.\n\n    3.  **Bin Utilization Balance:** Bins that are very empty or almost full are\n        slightly penalized to encourage mid-range utilization, promoting a more\n        balanced distribution of items across bins. This aims to avoid creating\n        bins that are almost full with one item.\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        size_diff_epsilon: A small constant added to size_diff to avoid division by zero.\n        small_waste_penalty_factor: Factor to control the strength of the small waste penalty.\n        extreme_utilization_penalty_factor: Factor to control the strength of the extreme utilization penalty.\n        target_utilization: The target utilization level (fraction full) for balancing.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 1.

Small constant added to size_diff\n\n    # Consider only bins with sufficient capacity\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priorities[~valid_bins] = -np.inf\n\n    # 2. Waste Minimization Penalty\n    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item\n    small_waste_penalty = np.exp(-small_waste_penalty_factor * remaining_after_fit)\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= small_waste_penalty[valid_bins]\n\n    # 3. Bin Utilization Balance Penalty (U-shaped utilization preference)\n    utilization = (1 - (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)))  # Fraction full, range [0, 1] where 1 is empty and 0 is full\n    extreme_utilization_penalty = extreme_utilization_penalty_factor * np.abs(utilization - target_utilization) # Penalize bins that have utilization far from 0.5 (half full)\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] -= extreme_utilization_penalty[valid_bins]\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    ratios = item / bins_remain_cap\n    log_ratios = np.log(ratios)\n    priorities = -log_ratios\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, adaptive bin balancing, and a fullness bonus, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (19th) have the same differences. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one has waste penalty adjustment. (3rd) vs (4th) shows similar pattern. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the core logic is same. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors such as best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing and fullness, and often adjust the weights of these factors dynamically based on the overall fill level and item sizes. They tend to include adaptive components and penalties for over-utilization. Simpler ones only focus on the ratio.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, dynamic adjustment, multi-factor integration, state-dependent penalties/bonuses.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently combine multiple factors, dynamically adjusting their influence based on the current problem state or search trajectory. Prioritize real-time feedback mechanisms to inform these adjustments.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about \"combining factors\" without specifying *how* or the *basis* for adjustment. Avoid generic advice like \"consider edge cases\" without concrete examples.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection should lead to implementable design principles. This means moving beyond generalities to concrete strategies for incorporating adaptability and state-awareness into heuristic design.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
