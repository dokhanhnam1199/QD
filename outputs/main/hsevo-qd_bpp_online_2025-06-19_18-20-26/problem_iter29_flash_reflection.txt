**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic includes best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and a dynamic bonus for almost-full bins, with adaptive weight adjustments based on item size and overall bin utilization and also has edge case handling, while the worst only considers FFD approximation, waste minimization, and capacity ratio. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) are almost the same. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see only documentation different; (3rd) vs (4th) are almost the same; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see only documentation different; Overall: better heuristics incorporate more factors (best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, fullness bonus) and dynamically adjust weights based on problem state (item size, overall utilization). Also, robust heuristics handle edge cases gracefully.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, adapt weights dynamically based on the problem state, and handle edge cases. Normalization of priorities and consideration of item sizes relative to bin capacities can improve performance. Waste minimization should be dynamically adjusted based on remaining capacity and item size.
