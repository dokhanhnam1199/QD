Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Contextual, Iterative, Feedback-driven.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that learn from each iteration and adapt their parameters/strategies based on problem-specific context and performance feedback.
*   **Avoid:** Static, rigid heuristics; "one-size-fits-all" approaches; ignoring problem-specific characteristics.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of fixed rules, aim for heuristics that iteratively refine their behavior by analyzing the problem's landscape and learning from past mistakes.
