{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design effective heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors adaptively based on the current problem state. Focus on dynamically adjusting weights and targets based on overall progress to improve the solution quality, by preventing common pitfalls such as over-utilization or excessive waste.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and combine them thoughtfully. Prioritize known effective strategies like FFD. Address edge cases explicitly to ensure robustness. Normalizing and scaling the factors properly can enhance the final combined heuristic.\n\nEffective heuristic design requires integrating multiple relevant factors and adapting strategies based on the problem's current state. Prioritize approaches that dynamically adjust parameters and penalties based on feedback from the environment or characteristics of the input data. Simpler heuristics can serve as a baseline, but richer models are generally required for high-quality solutions.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for bin packing involve a blend of best-fit strategies, waste reduction, and balanced bin utilization. Adaptive parameter adjustments based on the current state of the bins can significantly enhance performance. Also giving fine-grained control is very useful for design better heuristics.\n\nEffective heuristics for bin packing require a multifaceted approach combining best-fit strategies, waste management, and bin balancing. Adaptive adjustments based on overall fill levels and item sizes can significantly improve performance. Prioritizing tight fits and penalizing small waste are key considerations.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider incorporating adaptive components that dynamically adjust weights and parameters based on real-time feedback and historical performance. Also, think about handling edge cases, normalizing priorities and scaling penalties based on item sizes and overall utilization.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and dynamically adjusting their weights based on the current state. Adaptive penalties and bonuses are useful for refining the search. Normalizing priorities can prevent any single factor from dominating.\n\nComplex heuristics often outperform simpler ones in bin packing, but the key is balancing complexity with computational cost. Adaptive parameters are better in heuristic design. Normalization of weights can help to avoid domination of any single factor. Small changes in heuristic implementation can lead to better results.\n\nTo design better heuristics, prioritize dynamic adjustments of parameters based on problem state. Combining multiple known strategies (best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing) with adaptive weighting improves performance. Handle edge cases explicitly.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors, such as best-fit, waste minimization, and bin balancing. Implement adaptive parameter tuning based on problem state. Avoid oversimplification and address edge cases. Waste minimization and penalizing extreme bin utilization are important for online bin packing.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, adapt weights dynamically based on the problem state, and handle edge cases. Normalization of priorities and consideration of item sizes relative to bin capacities can improve performance. Waste minimization should be dynamically adjusted based on remaining capacity and item size.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, adapt weights dynamically based on the problem state, and incorporate domain-specific knowledge like item size or bin fill level. Waste management and bin balancing appear crucial for the bin packing problem. Start with a complex approach, and simplify after.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
