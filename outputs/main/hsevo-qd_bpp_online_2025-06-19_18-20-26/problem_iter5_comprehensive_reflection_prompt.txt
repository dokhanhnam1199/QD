{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristic design requires integrating multiple relevant factors and adapting strategies based on the problem's current state. Prioritize approaches that dynamically adjust parameters and penalties based on feedback from the environment or characteristics of the input data. Simpler heuristics can serve as a baseline, but richer models are generally required for high-quality solutions.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and combine them thoughtfully. Prioritize known effective strategies like FFD. Address edge cases explicitly to ensure robustness. Normalizing and scaling the factors properly can enhance the final combined heuristic.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
