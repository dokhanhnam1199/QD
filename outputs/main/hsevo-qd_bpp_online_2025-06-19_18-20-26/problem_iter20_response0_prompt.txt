Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,\n                size_diff_epsilon: float = 0.0004976631192414565,\n                small_waste_penalty_factor: float = 13.759620087105052,\n                extreme_utilization_penalty_factor: float = 10.96255884116071,\n                target_utilization: float = 0.2781292500038949) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function incorporates several heuristics:\n\n    1.  **First Fit Decreasing (FFD) Approximation:** Bins closer in size to the item\n        (but still large enough) get higher priority.  This approximates the FFD\n        algorithm which is known to be reasonably effective.\n\n    2.  **Waste Minimization:**  Penalizes bins where the item leaves a very small\n        remaining capacity (high waste). This is crucial in online scenarios where\n        future items might fit perfectly into larger waste spaces.\n\n    3.  **Bin Utilization Balance:** Bins that are very empty or almost full are\n        slightly penalized to encourage mid-range utilization, promoting a more\n        balanced distribution of items across bins.

The best heuristic incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, and adaptive fullness bonus, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity.  The better heuristic uses NumPy operations for efficiency, calculates utilization metrics, and dynamically adjusts penalties and bonuses.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see a similar trend. The second-best heuristic, like the best, accounts for best-fit, waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, and adaptive fullness bonus, showing the importance of these factors.  The second worst, similar to the worst, only focuses on the item-to-bin ratio.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see nearly identical code.  This suggests that the performance difference might be subtle and related to external factors like the specific dataset used for testing or other parts of the bin-packing algorithm. The adaptive parameters of first heuristic is better.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see a small addition of `Adaptive Waste Penalty Adjustment` in (4th), which adds a condition base on item size to avoid small waste when bins are full, and no normalization of priorities. The normalization of priorities in (7th) gives better distribution of weights to avoid domination by any single factor.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both only calculate the ratio of item size to bin capacity, but the second worst calculates log then multiplies by -1.\n\nOverall: The best heuristics prioritize a combination of factors, including best-fit, waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, adaptive fullness bonuses, and item-size awareness. They dynamically adjust penalties and bonuses based on overall bin utilization and item sizes.  The worse heuristics focus solely on the ratio of item size to bin capacity, neglecting other critical aspects of bin packing.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Dynamic, Normalization, Edge Cases, Integration, Feedback.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on developing heuristics that adapt dynamically based on real-time feedback and input data characteristics. Integrate multiple relevant factors thoughtfully. Normalize and scale inputs appropriately. Explicitly handle edge cases.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Generic statements about \"best-fit,\" \"waste reduction,\" or \"bin balancing\" without specifying how to achieve them adaptively. Avoid vague notions of \"fine-grained control.\"\n\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of stating obvious principles, concentrate on *mechanisms* for adapting heuristic parameters and weights based on the problem state. This requires analyzing the current solution and adjusting strategies accordingly.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
