**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic `priority_v2` is a complex function incorporating best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and an adaptive fullness bonus, while the bottom heuristic only calculates the negative log of the item size to bin capacity ratio. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst) which are (2nd) and (19th), the differences are negligible, both share the complexity of the first. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first and second heuristics in the list are virtually identical. (3rd) vs (4th) are the same. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see nearly identical code, except for the parameters. Overall: the superior heuristics employ a combination of best-fit approximation, waste minimization, and bin utilization balancing, often with dynamic adjustments based on overall bin fill levels. The inferior heuristics focus on a single factor (e.g., capacity ratio) or lack adaptive mechanisms. The top heuristics prioritize tight fits and penalize small waste, especially when placing larger items, while balancing overall bin utilization.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics for bin packing require a multifaceted approach combining best-fit strategies, waste management, and bin balancing. Adaptive adjustments based on overall fill levels and item sizes can significantly improve performance. Prioritizing tight fits and penalizing small waste are key considerations.
