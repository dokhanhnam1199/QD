**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates best-fit, waste minimization, adaptive bin balancing, and a fullness bonus, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to bin capacity. (2nd best) vs (19th) have the same differences. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one has waste penalty adjustment. (3rd) vs (4th) shows similar pattern. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the core logic is same. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors such as best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing and fullness, and often adjust the weights of these factors dynamically based on the overall fill level and item sizes. They tend to include adaptive components and penalties for over-utilization. Simpler ones only focus on the ratio.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and dynamically adjusting their weights based on the current state. Adaptive penalties and bonuses are useful for refining the search. Normalizing priorities can prevent any single factor from dominating.
