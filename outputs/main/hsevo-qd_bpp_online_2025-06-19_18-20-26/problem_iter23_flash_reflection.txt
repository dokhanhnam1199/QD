**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (10th), we see (1st) uses dynamic waste management, bin balancing and learning components; (10th) uses FFD approximation, waste minimization, and bin utilization balance. (1st) adjusts weights dynamically based on overall fill level while (10th) uses fixed parameters.
*   Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see (2nd) incorporates adaptive waste penalty adjustment based on item size and overall utilization, while (19th) sticks to basic waste minimization.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (14th), we see (3rd) uses adaptive parameter tuning and dynamic waste thresholding, (14th) employs basic FFD approximation, waste minimization and bin utilization.
*   Comparing (4th) vs (15th), we see (4th) introduces a bin activation strategy and normalizes waste by item size, while (15th) uses the same basic heuristic as (14th)
*   Comparing (11th) vs (20th), we see (11th) has best fit emphasis, adaptive waste minimization, dynamic bin balancing, penalty for over-utilized bins while (20th) has capacity ratio.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) emphasizes dynamic parameter adjustments, and a learning component; (2nd) introduces item size aware waste penalty
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see (3rd) features adaptive thresholding and edge case handling for nearly full bins, while (4th) incorporates bin activation and discourages both small and large waste with normalization.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (19th) combines FFD approximation, waste minimization and capacity ratio; (20th) has capacity ratio.
*   Overall: Better heuristics incorporate dynamic adjustments based on overall fill levels, item sizes, and potential waste. They include a combination of best-fit considerations with waste minimization and bin balancing. The best heuristics feature edge case handling and adaptive parameter tuning, while less effective heuristics rely on simpler, static rules.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, prioritize dynamic adjustments of parameters based on problem state. Combining multiple known strategies (best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing) with adaptive weighting improves performance. Handle edge cases explicitly.
