**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines multiple factors like best-fit, waste minimization, bin balancing, and fullness bonus with dynamic adjustments, whereas the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.
(2nd best) vs (second worst) shows similar differences. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that (1st) introduces an adaptive waste penalty adjustment and a penalty for over-utilized bins, making it slightly more sophisticated than (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th) shows that (3rd) incorporates utilization awareness into its waste minimization component through `waste_penalty_factor`.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see very similar approaches, with minor variations in how the ratio is handled. Overall: The better heuristics involve a more complex and adaptive combination of factors, especially regarding dynamic waste management, bin balancing, and fullness bonuses, with the parameters of these factors often depending on overall bin utilization and item sizes. The worst perform much simpler calculations using ratios.

**Experience:**

To design effective heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors adaptively based on the current problem state. Focus on dynamically adjusting weights and targets based on overall progress to improve the solution quality, by preventing common pitfalls such as over-utilization or excessive waste.
