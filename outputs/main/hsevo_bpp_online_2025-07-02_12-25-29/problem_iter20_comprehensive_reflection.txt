Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing bin packing heuristics. We'll focus on actionable insights and avoid the pitfalls of the "Ineffective self-reflection" examples.

Here's a refined version:

*   **Keywords:** Directness, combination, normalization, exploration, clear objectives, gradual refinement.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize direct combinations of closeness-of-fit and fullness. Use normalization to balance different criteria and facilitate exploration of the design space. Handle edge cases explicitly (e.g., no fit bins).

*   **Avoid:** Multiplicative combinations, premature complexity, relying solely on randomness, neglecting the optimization objective.

*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics that are both clear and effective. Begin with a simple core and add complexity cautiously. Ensure factors like fill level and fit contribute directly to the optimization goal, and normalize priorities across different factors.
