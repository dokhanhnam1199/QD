Okay, let's refine "current self-reflection" to guide better heuristic design, steering clear of the pitfalls of "ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a revised breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Clarity, directness, balance, adaptability, edge case handling, interpretability, evaluation, validation, parameterization.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize clear, direct combinations of relevant factors; validate inputs early; explicitly handle edge cases (e.g., infeasibility); use parameterization judiciously for flexibility, but maintain interpretability.

*   **Avoid:** Unnecessary complexity, multiplicative combinations, opaque calculations, unchecked randomness, overlooking the objective function, over-parameterization.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on simplicity, directness, and validation. Design clear, interpretable rules, address edge cases effectively, and prioritize comprehensive evaluation to assess the impact of each change.
