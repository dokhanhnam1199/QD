{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize clear, interpretable rules that directly address the optimization objective. Combine rewards for desired properties (e.g., close fit, high utilization) with penalties for undesirable ones (e.g., wasted space, fragmentation). Consider a negative infinity value in order to avoid picking invalid bins. Start simple and gradually add complexity, evaluating the impact of each addition.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
