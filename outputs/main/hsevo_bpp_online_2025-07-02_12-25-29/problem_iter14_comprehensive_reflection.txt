Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better bin packing heuristics, focusing on avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a revised approach to self-reflection, designed for actionable improvements:

*   **Keywords:** Objective alignment, Component Interaction, Early Exit, Parameter control.
*   **Advice:** Focus on the *interaction* of combined factors (close-fit, fill). Iteratively refine these interactions and early exits based on *empirical performance*.
*   **Avoid:** Vague considerations (e.g., "handle fragmentation" without a specific implementation). Over-parameterization without demonstrable benefit.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize strategies grounded in data & experimentation. Don't get lost in general considerations; test specific ideas and measure the effect on performance.
