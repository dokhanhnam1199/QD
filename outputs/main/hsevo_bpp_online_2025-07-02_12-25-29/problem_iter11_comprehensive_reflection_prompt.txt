{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize comprehensive evaluation, early input validation, and incorporate penalties/bonuses to target specific outcomes. Adding parameterization allows for greater flexibility and optimization, but should not come at the expense of clarity. Always avoid unnecessary calculations.\nPrioritize clear, direct combinations of relevant factors like closeness of fit and resulting fullness. Use exponential decay to fine-tune priorities. Explicitly handle infeasible bins with -inf. Explore the design space to handle fragmentation, but avoid multiplicative combinations, and carefully consider the impact of randomness to avoid undermining the core heuristics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize clear, interpretable rules that directly address the optimization objective. Combine rewards for desired properties (e.g., close fit, high utilization) with penalties for undesirable ones (e.g., wasted space, fragmentation). Consider a negative infinity value in order to avoid picking invalid bins. Start simple and gradually add complexity, evaluating the impact of each addition.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating filling thresholds, larger bin bonuses, and error-handling techniques, such as dealing with potential division by zero. Validating possible conditions can prevent errors and improve robustness.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
