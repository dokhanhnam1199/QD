Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

**Keywords:** Clarity, Directness, Iterative Refinement, Objective-Driven.

**Advice:** Design heuristics with easily understandable rules directly linked to improving the objective function (e.g., minimizing wasted space). Start with a simple baseline heuristic and iteratively add complexity based on performance evaluation.

**Avoid:** Over-parameterization, multiplicative combinations of factors without strong justification, premature optimization, and complex calculations that obscure the heuristic's core logic.

**Explanation:** Focus on interpretable rules that directly contribute to the objective. Build incrementally, measuring the impact of each addition. Prioritize understanding over complex parameter tuning. Handle edge cases and invalid scenarios explicitly but simply.
