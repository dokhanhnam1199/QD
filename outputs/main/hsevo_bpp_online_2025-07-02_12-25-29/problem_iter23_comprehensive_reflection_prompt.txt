{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity, clarity, and normalization. Address fragmentation, target fill levels, and edge cases. Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-parameterization. Early exits are beneficial. Favor interpretable code over complex, hyperparameter-laden approaches.\n```\nPrioritize clear, direct combinations of relevant factors like closeness of fit and resulting fullness. Use exponential decay to fine-tune priorities. Explicitly handle infeasible bins with -inf. Explore the design space to handle fragmentation, but avoid multiplicative combinations, and carefully consider the impact of randomness to avoid undermining the core heuristics.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize clear, interpretable rules that directly address the optimization objective. Combine rewards for desired properties (e.g., close fit, high utilization) with penalties for undesirable ones (e.g., wasted space, fragmentation). Consider a negative infinity value in order to avoid picking invalid bins. Start simple and gradually add complexity, evaluating the impact of each addition.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating filling thresholds, larger bin bonuses, and error-handling techniques, such as dealing with potential division by zero. Validating possible conditions can prevent errors and improve robustness.\n\nPrioritize comprehensive evaluation, early input validation, and incorporate penalties/bonuses to target specific outcomes. Adding parameterization allows for greater flexibility and optimization, but should not come at the expense of clarity. Always avoid unnecessary calculations.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider combining close-fit rewards, target fill bonuses, and fragmentation penalties. Implement early exit strategies for edge cases and carefully tune the weighting of different factors. Use exponential decay functions for smoother transitions in priority scores. Handle cases where no items fit.\n\nEffective heuristics often balance multiple factors with carefully tuned weights. Handling edge cases, such as items that don't fit any bin, is crucial. Simplicity aids interpretability and reduces the risk of overfitting, while dynamic adjustments can improve adaptability but require careful consideration.\n\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider factors like fragmentation, target fill levels, and close fits. Implement early exits for perfect fits and handle edge cases. Penalize leaving large or small remaining space and normalize priorities.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
