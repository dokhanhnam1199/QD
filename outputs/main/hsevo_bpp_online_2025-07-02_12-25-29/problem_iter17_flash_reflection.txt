**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first heuristic is simpler, focusing on close fit, target fill, and fragmentation avoidance with fixed parameters, while the 20th dynamically adjusts parameters based on item size, offering potentially better adaptability but at the cost of increased complexity.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second heuristic gives bonus to bins larger than the item while the 19th adds early exit when perfectly fit bin is found. The 19th also has a stronger penalty for bins with large remaining space.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these two heuristics are identical.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), we see the 19th heuristic has early exit when perfectly fit bin is found while 20th heuristic has early exit if no bins can fit the item. The 20th dynamically adjusts parameters. Also, the 20th heuristic assigns -inf penalty to bins where item doesn't fit. Overall: The better heuristics prioritize a balance of simplicity and effectiveness, using targeted bonuses and penalties related to fill level, fit, and fragmentation. Early exits and handling of edge cases (like no fitting bins) are also helpful. More complex, dynamic approaches might offer benefits, but increase the risk of overfitting or computational overhead.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics often balance multiple factors with carefully tuned weights. Handling edge cases, such as items that don't fit any bin, is crucial. Simplicity aids interpretability and reduces the risk of overfitting, while dynamic adjustments can improve adaptability but require careful consideration.
