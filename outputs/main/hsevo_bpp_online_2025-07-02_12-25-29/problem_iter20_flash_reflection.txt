**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st prioritizes bins based on space utilization, fragmentation and filling threshold. The 2nd prioritizes bins based on close fit, filling and avoids fragmentation. However, the 2nd has an early exit for perfect fit. The 2nd also has a penalty for leaving large remaining space.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), they are identical.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), they are identical.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), we see that the 7th prioritizes bins based on fill target, fit and fragmentation with early exits and the 8th prioritizes bins based on whether the item fits, remaining capacity, filling threshold and penalizing bins that are already too full.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), we see that the 9th prioritizes bins based on close fit, target fill and avoids fragmentation and takes `bin_capacity` as an argument and the 10th combines target fill, close fit and handles edge cases.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), we see that the 11th prioritizes bins that results in a fill level closest to a target and the 12th prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors like ability to fit item, target fill level, avoiding excessive fragmentation and a tie-breaker for the fullest bin so far.

Comparing (13th) vs (14th), we see that the 13th prioritizes bins considering close fit, target fill, and fragmentation with early exit with adjusted penalties. The 14th prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors like ability to fit item, target fill level, avoiding excessive fragmentation and a tie-breaker for the fullest bin so far.

Comparing (15th, 16th, 17th, 18th) they only implement early exit of perfect fit.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), they are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics tend to consider more factors such as fragmentation, target fill level, and close fit. They also implement early exits for perfect fit scenarios and handle edge cases where no bins can fit the item. Penalties for large remaining space and small remaining space after fit are also important.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider factors like fragmentation, target fill levels, and close fits. Implement early exits for perfect fits and handle edge cases. Penalize leaving large or small remaining space and normalize priorities.
