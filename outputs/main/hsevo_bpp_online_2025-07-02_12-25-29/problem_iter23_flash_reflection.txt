**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st heuristic uses a simpler, more direct approach with clear priorities, while the 20th introduces many hyperparameters and external libraries (scipy, torch) without a clear justification, making it less understandable and potentially over-engineered. (2nd) vs (19th): Similar to above, the 2nd heuristic is simpler and more readable than the 19th.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic focuses on fragmentation by filling above a threshold and close fit, while 2nd adds a desperation strategy of placing items in the smallest bin if it doesn't fit, and a penalty for large remaining space. (3rd) vs (4th) - no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, indicating a lack of unique strategies in the worst-performing heuristics.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), (9th) vs (10th): Normalization is present in some top heuristics but absent in the later heuristics. The top heuristics make use of normalization to ensure combined factors contribute evenly.

Overall: The best heuristics prioritize simplicity, clarity, and normalization of factors considered. They address fragmentation and target fill levels effectively. The worst heuristics suffer from over-parameterization, unnecessary complexity, and lack of a clear strategy. Early exits for the perfect fit are beneficial. Normalization helps in balancing the effects of different parameters. Edge case handling (no bin fits) is important.

**Experience:**
Prioritize simplicity, clarity, and normalization. Address fragmentation, target fill levels, and edge cases. Avoid unnecessary complexity and over-parameterization. Early exits are beneficial. Favor interpretable code over complex, hyperparameter-laden approaches.
