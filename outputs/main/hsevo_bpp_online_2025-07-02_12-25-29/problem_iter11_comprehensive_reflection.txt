Okay, I'm ready to help you earn that tip! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, focusing on effectiveness and avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, validation, additive penalties/bonuses, incremental complexity.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics from the objective function *outward*. Prioritize validated inputs and outputs at each stage. Use additive (linear) combinations of rewards/penalties for desired/undesired outcomes. Introduce complexity *incrementally*, carefully measuring each addition's impact on solution quality and runtime.

*   **Avoid:** Premature parameterization, complex multiplicative combinations, and unchecked randomness without clear justification.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on directly addressing the optimization goal with simple, verifiable steps. Parameterization without a strong justification, complex multiplicative rules, and randomness can obscure the heuristic's behavior, making it harder to understand, debug, and improve. Build from a simple base, validating each addition.
