**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of "nearly full," "reasonable fit," and "size difference," along with handling the case where no item fits by assigning a large negative priority except to the bin with the smallest capacity. The worst focuses on similar concepts but is less refined. (2nd) is identical to (1st) which is a perfect clone so no differences. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), (1st) uses a "nearly full" bonus with an exponential decay based on the absolute difference between remaining capacity and zero, while (3rd) uses a target fill bonus and avoids tiny fragments, adding a desperation strategy when no item fits. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the main difference is that (4th) is heavily parameterized, allowing for fine-tuning but potentially overfitting, while (3rd) uses hardcoded values. (15th) focuses on waste calculation, near-full bonus, and fragmentation penalty, ensuring non-negative priorities, whilst many other heuristics are similar but the weighting and combination of factors vary significantly. Comparing (16th) vs (17th), we observe similar priorities for close fit, filling target, and fragmentation, but (17th) explicitly handles the case where no items fit using an early exit strategy. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the difference lies in the explicit `ValueError` check for negative bin capacities and the more refined bonus/penalty calculations in the second worst. Overall: better heuristics seem to involve a combination of close-fit rewards, target fill bonuses, fragmentation penalties, and careful consideration of edge cases where no items fit or negative bin capacities exist. The weighting of these factors and the use of exponential decay functions appear to influence performance significantly.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider combining close-fit rewards, target fill bonuses, and fragmentation penalties. Implement early exit strategies for edge cases and carefully tune the weighting of different factors. Use exponential decay functions for smoother transitions in priority scores. Handle cases where no items fit.
