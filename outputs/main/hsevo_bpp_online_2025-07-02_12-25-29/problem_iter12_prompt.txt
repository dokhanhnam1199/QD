Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This version considers space utilization, fragmentation, and a filling threshold.\n    It prioritizes bins where the item fits, leading to a fill level above a certain threshold,\n    while also considering bins that offer a close fit.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Define a filling threshold (e.g., 75% full) after adding the item\n    filling_threshold = 0.75\n    bin_capacity = 1.0  # Assuming bin capacity is 1.0, modify as needed\n\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Identify bins where the item fits\n    item_fits = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # Calculate fill level after adding the item\n    fill_level = (bin_capacity - remaining_after_fit) / bin_capacity\n    \n    # Give a bonus to bins that meet the filling threshold after item placement\n    threshold_bonus = np.where(item_fits & (fill_level >= filling_threshold), 1.0, 0.0)\n    priorities += threshold_bonus\n\n    # Give high priority to bins where the item almost fits perfectly\n    close_fit = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    close_fit_priority = np.exp(-5 * close_fit)  # Exponential decay around perfect fit\n    priorities += close_fit_priority * item_fits  # Only consider if the item fits\n\n    # Penalize bins where the item doesn't fit (assign zero priority)\n    priorities[bins_remain_cap < item] = 0\n\n    # Reward bins that become nearly full after adding the item, but less aggressively\n    nearly_full = np.exp(-10 * np.abs(remaining_after_fit)) * item_fits\n    priorities += 0.5 * nearly_full\n    \n    # Add a small bonus for bins which are larger than the item, to prioritize packing\n    # something rather than nothing.\n    larger_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item)\n    priorities += 0.1 * larger_bins\n\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, I'm ready to help you earn that tip! Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on effectiveness and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, validation, additive penalties/bonuses, incremental complexity.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics from the objective function *outward*. Prioritize validated inputs and outputs at each stage. Use additive (linear) combinations of rewards/penalties for desired/undesired outcomes. Introduce complexity *incrementally*, carefully measuring each addition's impact on solution quality and runtime.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature parameterization, complex multiplicative combinations, and unchecked randomness without clear justification.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on directly addressing the optimization goal with simple, verifiable steps. Parameterization without a strong justification, complex multiplicative rules, and randomness can obscure the heuristic's behavior, making it harder to understand, debug, and improve. Build from a simple base, validating each addition.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
