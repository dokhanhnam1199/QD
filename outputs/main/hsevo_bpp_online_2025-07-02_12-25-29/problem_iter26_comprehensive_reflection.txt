Okay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for designing heuristics, focusing on effectiveness and clarity:

*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, interpretable, incremental refinement, validated assumptions, parameter impact.

*   **Advice:** Focus on direct optimization objective alignment; validate assumptions thoroughly; prioritize simplicity; evaluate the marginal benefit of added complexity.

*   **Avoid:** Unnecessary complexity; over-parameterization without clear benefit; opaque combinations of factors; neglecting validation.

*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should be built methodically, with each component demonstrably improving performance relative to the core objective, avoid "black box" design and prefer solutions you can explain.
