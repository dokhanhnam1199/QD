**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first one prioritizes both close fit and resulting fullness, while the last one prioritizes wasted space, fullness, and exploration (adding noise). The first one uses a simple addition of exponential decays, while the last uses a product of exponential decays and adds a small exploration term.

(2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the second prioritizes wasted space and fullness, adding a boost for almost full bins. The second-worst also considers wasted space and fullness, but it combines close fit and fullness through multiplication and adds exploration through noise.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first one uses a simple addition of `close_fit` and `nearly_full` priorities, while the second focuses on `waste` and adds a priority boost when the bin is almost full. The first uses `-np.inf` for infeasible bins while the second immediately returns when all bins are infeasible.

(3rd) vs (4th), we see that the third calculates a closeness of fit, rewards nearly full bins, penalizes bins that remain far from full, and considers a minimum utilization threshold.  The fourth simply combines closeness of fit and near fullness without considering utilization or thresholds.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the only difference is the comment.

Overall: The better heuristics seem to focus on directly combining closeness of fit and fullness, often using exponential decay to prioritize bins. They also incorporate mechanisms to avoid fragmentation, either through a minimum utilization threshold or by penalizing bins that will remain mostly empty after an item is added. The worse heuristics tend to multiply the priority scores (reward and penalty) together and adds noise to encourage exploration, which appears to be less effective in this context. Also the best heuristics directly assign -inf to infeasible bins.

**Experience:**

Prioritize clear, direct combinations of relevant factors like closeness of fit and resulting fullness. Use exponential decay to fine-tune priorities. Explicitly handle infeasible bins with -inf. Explore the design space to handle fragmentation, but avoid multiplicative combinations, and carefully consider the impact of randomness to avoid undermining the core heuristics.
