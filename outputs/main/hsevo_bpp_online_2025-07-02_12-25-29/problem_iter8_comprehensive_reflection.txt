Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to focus on actionable insights for better heuristic design, steering clear of the pitfalls outlined in "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Robustness, validation, directness, impact analysis, avoidance.
*   **Advice:** Implement validation checks during heuristic execution. Combine factors additively where possible. Explicitly address edge cases such as infeasible bins.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly adding complexity, multiplicative combinations of factors without strong justification. Over-reliance on randomness that obscures heuristic logic.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on creating robust heuristics by checking for possible errors before and after bin selections. Evaluate the real impact after adding each new factor.
