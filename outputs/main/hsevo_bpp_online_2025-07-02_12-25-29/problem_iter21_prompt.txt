Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This version considers space utilization, fragmentation, and a filling threshold.\n    It prioritizes bins where the item fits, leading to a fill level above a certain threshold,\n    while also considering bins that offer a close fit.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Define a filling threshold (e.g., 75% full) after adding the item\n    filling_threshold = 0.75\n    bin_capacity = 1.0  # Assuming bin capacity is 1.0, modify as needed\n\n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item\n    remaining_after_fit = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Identify bins where the item fits\n    item_fits = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    # Calculate fill level after adding the item\n    fill_level = (bin_capacity - remaining_after_fit) / bin_capacity\n    \n    # Give a bonus to bins that meet the filling threshold after item placement\n    threshold_bonus = np.where(item_fits & (fill_level >= filling_threshold), 1.0, 0.0)\n    priorities += threshold_bonus\n\n    # Give high priority to bins where the item almost fits perfectly\n    close_fit = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    close_fit_priority = np.exp(-5 * close_fit)  # Exponential decay around perfect fit\n    priorities += close_fit_priority * item_fits  # Only consider if the item fits\n\n    # Penalize bins where the item doesn't fit (assign zero priority)\n    priorities[bins_remain_cap < item] = 0\n\n    # Reward bins that become nearly full after adding the item, but less aggressively\n    nearly_full = np.exp(-10 * np.abs(remaining_after_fit)) * item_fits\n    priorities += 0.5 * nearly_full\n    \n    # Add a small bonus for bins which are larger than the item, to prioritize packing\n    # something rather than nothing.\n    larger_bins = (bins_remain_cap >= item)\n    priorities += 0.1 * larger_bins\n\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing bin packing heuristics. We'll focus on actionable insights and avoid the pitfalls of the \"Ineffective self-reflection\" examples.\n\nHere's a refined version:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Directness, combination, normalization, exploration, clear objectives, gradual refinement.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize direct combinations of closeness-of-fit and fullness. Use normalization to balance different criteria and facilitate exploration of the design space. Handle edge cases explicitly (e.g., no fit bins).\n\n*   **Avoid:** Multiplicative combinations, premature complexity, relying solely on randomness, neglecting the optimization objective.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics that are both clear and effective. Begin with a simple core and add complexity cautiously. Ensure factors like fill level and fit contribute directly to the optimization goal, and normalize priorities across different factors.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
