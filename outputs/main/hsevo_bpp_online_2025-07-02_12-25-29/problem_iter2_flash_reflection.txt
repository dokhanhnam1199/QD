**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses exponential decay to prioritize bins based on how closely they fit the item and how full they would become after adding the item, while the worst heuristic aims for a target fill ratio of 0.7 and adds penalties based on median capacity and excessive remaining capacity. The best also considers fragmentation, unlike the worst.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see similar approaches to the (best) vs (worst) comparison. The second-best heuristic also considers space utilization and fragmentation, using exponential decay to prioritize bins. The second worst prioritizes bins with higher remaining capacity if no bins can fit the item, and then goes on to use a target fill ratio, penalizing deviations from it.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are exactly identical, meaning that small variations elsewhere must influence performance.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd uses wasted space and a fullness factor, and provides a bonus for exact fits, while the 4th uses a "quantum action" inspired approach, normalizing amplitudes based on wasted space to assign priorities. 3rd uses a simpler trade-off between wasted space and fullness.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see penalization for exceeding a proportion of item capacity.

Overall: Better heuristics use a combination of rewards and penalties, focusing on minimizing wasted space and fragmentation. Exponential decay functions seem effective for prioritizing bins based on fit and fullness. Avoiding target fill ratios and directly considering wasted space seems beneficial. More successful heuristics also often have negative infinity to avoid picking the invalid bins.
Simpler approaches with clearly defined rewards and penalties seem to outperform those inspired by more complex physical analogies.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, prioritize clear, interpretable rules that directly address the optimization objective. Combine rewards for desired properties (e.g., close fit, high utilization) with penalties for undesirable ones (e.g., wasted space, fragmentation). Consider a negative infinity value in order to avoid picking invalid bins. Start simple and gradually add complexity, evaluating the impact of each addition.
