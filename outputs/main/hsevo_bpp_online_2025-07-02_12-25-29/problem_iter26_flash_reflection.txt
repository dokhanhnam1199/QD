**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st prioritizes minimizing wasted space by exponentially penalizing remaining capacity, while the 20th uses a target fill and fragmentation penalty. The 1st also adds a small bonus for any bin where the item fits. The 20th handles the no-fit case by putting the item in the smallest bin, while the 1st does not explicitly handle this. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the 2nd incorporates a target fill level, while the second worst also handles no-fit scenarios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st uses wasted space to calculate priorities, while the 2nd version focuses on target fill. (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd allows parameters while the 4th has fixed hyper parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst has extra logic to handle a perfect fit and target fill conditions. Overall: The best heuristics generally focus on minimizing wasted space, considering target fill levels, and explicitly handling edge cases like perfect fits and situations where no bin can accommodate the item. Normalization helps. Penalizing fragmentation and considering bin selection pressure also contribute to better performance.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider minimizing wasted space and target fill levels. Handle edge cases explicitly (perfect fits, no-fit scenarios). Normalization is important. Consider adding "bin selection pressure". Parameters are important to consider.
