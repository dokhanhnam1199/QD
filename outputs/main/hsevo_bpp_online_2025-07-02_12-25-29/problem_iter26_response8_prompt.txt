The 1st also adds a small bonus for any bin where the item fits. The 20th handles the no-fit case by putting the item in the smallest bin, while the 1st does not explicitly handle this. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the 2nd incorporates a target fill level, while the second worst also handles no-fit scenarios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st uses wasted space to calculate priorities, while the 2nd version focuses on target fill. (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd allows parameters while the 4th has fixed hyper parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst has extra logic to handle a perfect fit and target fill conditions. Overall: The best heuristics generally focus on minimizing wasted space, considering target fill levels, and explicitly handling edge cases like perfect fits and situations where no bin can accommodate the item. Normalization helps. Penalizing fragmentation and considering bin selection pressure also contribute to better performance.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for designing heuristics, focusing on effectiveness and clarity:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective-driven, interpretable, incremental refinement, validated assumptions, parameter impact.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on direct optimization objective alignment; validate assumptions thoroughly; prioritize simplicity; evaluate the marginal benefit of added complexity.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Unnecessary complexity; over-parameterization without clear benefit; opaque combinations of factors; neglecting validation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should be built methodically, with each component demonstrably improving performance relative to the core objective, avoid \"black box\" design and prefer solutions you can explain.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
