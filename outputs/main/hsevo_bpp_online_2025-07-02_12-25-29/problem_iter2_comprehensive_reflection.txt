Okay, here's a refined definition of "Current self-reflection" to guide heuristic design, focusing on effectiveness:

*   **Keywords:** Objective-alignment, iterative refinement, evaluation, interpretable rules, reward/penalty system, constraint handling.

*   **Advice:** Explicitly link heuristic components to specific objectives. Measure the impact of each design choice on performance and interpretability. Prioritize constraint satisfaction.

*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, uninterpretable rules, neglecting objective alignment, insufficient evaluation.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on creating heuristics that directly optimize the target objective, adding complexity only when demonstrably beneficial and always evaluating their impact. Consider constraints early.
