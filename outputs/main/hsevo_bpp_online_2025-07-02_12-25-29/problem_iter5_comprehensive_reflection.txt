Here's a redefinition of "Current self-reflection," geared towards effective heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Direct factors, additive combinations, exponential decay, infeasibility handling, fragmentation exploration (additive).
*   **Advice:** Focus on additive combinations of clear, relevant factors. Use exponential decay for parameter tuning. Explicitly penalize infeasibility.
*   **Avoid:** Multiplicative combinations, excessive randomness that overshadows core heuristic logic.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize simple, interpretable rules, focusing on additive combinations of relevant factors. Control randomness to ensure heuristic reliability.
