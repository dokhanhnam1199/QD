**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st doesn't include calculating `wasted_space` to be `inf` to avoid errors, the 20th does. The 1st adds a boost priority to larger bins to promote using any bins over nothing. Comparing (1st) vs (6th), we see the 1st utilizes a filling threshold and gives a bonus, where the 6th considers a filling threshold. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see the 2nd and 19th codes are almost identical, save for a small coefficient. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the codes are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the codes are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the 19th initializes `possible_bins` and validates if they exist before proceeding. The 20th also includes `1e-9` to avoid divide-by-zero errors. Overall: The better heuristics take into account filling thresholds, and are concerned with errors arising with division and invalid conditions.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating filling thresholds, larger bin bonuses, and error-handling techniques, such as dealing with potential division by zero. Validating possible conditions can prevent errors and improve robustness.
