**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first incorporates a target fill level, nearly empty penalty, and nearly full bonus, while the last emphasizes close fit, utilization, and fragmentation. (2nd best) vs (second worst) reveal similar trends, with (2nd best) emphasizing filling threshold and close fit with wasted space considerations and (second worst) focusing on closeness of fit and utilization, but lacking specific target or penalties/bonuses. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see (1st) validates if the item fits first and returns early if not, while the (2nd) calculates before checking. (3rd) vs (4th) shows (3rd) has a penalty for small remaining capacity and (4th) parameterizes filling threshold and other parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (second worst) calculates fragmentation before masking infeasible bins, while (worst) calculates fragmentation and then masks, and it also includes scaling. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a wider range of factors and explicit checks, whereas the worse ones focus on fewer aspects and may lack robustness. The best ones also tend to validate the input early on and return early.

**Experience:**
Prioritize comprehensive evaluation, early input validation, and incorporate penalties/bonuses to target specific outcomes. Adding parameterization allows for greater flexibility and optimization, but should not come at the expense of clarity. Always avoid unnecessary calculations.
