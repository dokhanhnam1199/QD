**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 vs Heuristic 2: Heuristic 1 uses a log transform and a `tightness_ratio` for its score, while Heuristic 2 uses an inverse remaining capacity and a normalized excess capacity penalty. Heuristic 1's score `best_fit_score * penalty_multiplier` (where `penalty_multiplier = 1.0 / (excess_ratio + 0.2)`) appears more direct in penalizing bins with large excess capacity relative to item size.

Comparing Heuristic 3 vs Heuristic 7 (which are identical): Both use `fill_ratio * tightness` as their score, which is `item / (suitable_bins_remain_cap * (suitable_bins_remain_cap - item) + 1e-9)`. This score effectively balances the tightness of the fit with how much of the remaining space the item occupies, and it implicitly penalizes bins with large `suitable_bins_remain_cap`.

Comparing Heuristic 4 vs Heuristic 9 (which are identical): Both use a sigmoid function based on normalized slack. Heuristic 4 maps `max_slack - slack` to the sigmoid, aiming for higher scores for smaller slack. Heuristic 9 directly uses `differences * scale_factor` as the sigmoid input, achieving a similar goal.

Comparing Heuristic 5 vs Heuristic 6 (which are identical): Both prioritize exact fits with a high score, then use inverse remaining capacity for non-exact fits, normalizing these scores. This is a robust approach for prioritizing exact fits.

Comparing Heuristic 10 vs Heuristic 11/12: Heuristic 10 uses a product of Best Fit, Excess Capacity Penalty, and Distributional Balancing. Heuristics 11/12 combine Best Fit with a preference for "almost full" bins using a weighted sum. Heuristic 11/12's direct combination of `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon_small)` and `0.5 * (-remaining_after_fit)` seems more straightforward than Heuristic 10's multiplicative approach with potentially complex interactions.

Comparing Heuristic 13/14/15 vs Heuristic 16: Heuristics 13/14/15 prioritize exact fits (score 1.0) and then use an exponential decay `exp(-relative_capacities / mean_relative_capacity)` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 16 prioritizes exact fits with a high score and uses `exp(-scaled_relative_capacities)` for non-exact fits, where `scaled_relative_capacities` is normalized between 0 and 1. Heuristic 16's normalization and conditional scaling might lead to more stable and comparable scores.

Comparing Heuristic 17/18 vs Heuristic 19/20: Heuristics 17/18 use a sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-scaled_differences))` based on the negative difference for tight fits. Heuristics 19/20 use `exp(remaining_capacities)` scaled and normalized, which seems to amplify the preference for tighter fits directly. The sigmoid in 17/18 might offer smoother control.

Overall: Heuristics focusing on multiplicative combinations of "tightness" (like `1/(rem-item)`) and "fill ratio" (like `item/rem`), or those that directly penalize large initial remaining capacities, seem most promising for balancing fit quality and overall bin utilization. Exact fit prioritization is also a strong strategy. The complexity of penalties and normalizations can sometimes obscure the intended behavior.

**Experience:**
Prioritize exact fits. Combine "tightness of fit" (e.g., `1/(remaining-item)`) with "fill ratio" (e.g., `item/remaining`) multiplicatively. Penalize bins with disproportionately large initial capacities. Avoid overly complex scaling or normalization if simpler direct combinations suffice.
