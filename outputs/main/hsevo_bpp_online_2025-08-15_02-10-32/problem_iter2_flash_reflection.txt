**Analysis:**
Comparing Heuristic 1 (Exact Fit First) and Heuristic 2 (Best Fit): Heuristic 1 prioritizes exact fits and then falls back to First Fit, while Heuristic 2 strictly implements Best Fit. Heuristic 1's explicit handling of exact fits and fallback logic seems more robust for certain scenarios than a pure Best Fit.

Comparing Heuristic 1 and Heuristic 6 (Inverse of Remaining Capacity): Heuristic 1 offers a more sophisticated priority system with distinct cases (exact fit, then first fit). Heuristic 6 simply uses `1 / (remaining_capacity - item)`, which is a form of Best Fit but lacks the specific exact-fit advantage of Heuristic 1.

Comparing Heuristic 2 (Best Fit) and Heuristic 8 (Loop-based Best Fit): Heuristic 2 uses vectorized NumPy operations for efficiency, while Heuristic 8 uses a Python loop. Vectorization is generally preferred for performance in numerical computations. The logic is similar.

Comparing Heuristic 6 and Heuristic 11 (Identical): Heuristics 6 and 11 are identical. Both implement Best Fit by prioritizing bins with the least remaining capacity using the inverse of `(remaining_capacity - item)`.

Comparing Heuristic 7 and Heuristic 10 (Identical): Heuristics 7 and 10 are identical. They use an exponential decay based on the mean relative capacity, aiming to balance fits but potentially being sensitive to outliers.

Comparing Heuristic 5 (Sigmoid Fit Score) and Heuristic 12 (Scaled Sigmoid): Heuristic 12 uses a more carefully tuned sigmoid function with scaling parameters based on the range of valid fits. Heuristic 5's sigmoid scaling is fixed, making Heuristic 12 likely more adaptable to different data distributions.

Comparing Heuristic 16 (Remaining Capacity) and Heuristic 18 (Identical): Heuristics 16 and 18 simply return the remaining capacity if the item fits, otherwise -1. This is a very basic heuristic and doesn't actively try to optimize packing beyond identifying bins that can fit.

Comparing Heuristic 13 (Relative Capacity) and Heuristic 17 (Normalized Exponential Relative Capacity): Heuristic 13 uses a simple ratio `(remaining - item) / remaining`. Heuristic 17 uses an exponential of the relative capacity, normalized across fitting bins. Heuristic 17's approach seems to give stronger preference to tighter fits via exponentiation.

Overall: Heuristics that combine explicit strategies like exact fits with fallback mechanisms (e.g., Heuristic 1) or use well-tuned mathematical transformations (e.g., Heuristic 12's scaled sigmoid) appear more robust. Simple implementations of Best Fit (e.g., Heuristic 6, 11) are effective but less nuanced. Heuristics with simple negative remaining capacity or fixed scaling (e.g., 16, 18, 5) are less sophisticated.

**Experience:**
Prioritize clarity and specific strategies (like exact fits). Vectorized operations are key for performance. Nuanced mathematical transformations (sigmoid, exponentials) can capture complex preferences but require careful tuning. Avoid overly simplistic heuristics or arbitrary thresholds.
