    # The "almost full" heuristic means we prefer bins that are nearly full,
    # but can still accommodate the item. This implies minimizing the remaining space
    # after placing the item.
    # So, a bin with remaining capacity just slightly larger than the item is preferred.
    
    # Let's score based on the remaining capacity after placing the item.
    # We want to find the bin that leaves the *least* remaining capacity.
    # This is equivalent to finding the bin whose current remaining capacity is closest to the item size,
    # such that the remaining capacity is still greater than or equal to the item size.
    
    # If a bin's remaining capacity is exactly the item size, that's ideal for "almost full".
    # If it's slightly larger, it's also good.
    # If it's much larger, it's less preferable.
    
    # We can assign a high priority to bins where bins_remain_cap is just above 'item'.
    # Let's consider a scoring function that favors bins where (bins_remain_cap - item) is minimal.
    # For bins that can fit, we can give a score that is inversely related to the remaining space.
    # However, to implement "almost full", we want to prioritize bins that are *already* quite full.
    
    # A common approach for "almost full" is to look for bins with remaining capacity
    # that is just enough or slightly more than the item.
    
    # Let's assign priority based on the "tightness" of the fit.
    # A tighter fit (smaller difference between remaining capacity and item size) is preferred.
    
    # For bins that can fit the item:
    # Score = 1 / (epsilon + (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))
    # where epsilon is a small constant to avoid division by zero and to provide a base value.
    # This would give higher scores for smaller (bins_remain_cap[i] - item).
    
    # To strongly favor "almost full", we can give a bonus if the remaining capacity is
    # within a small margin of the item size.
    
    # Let's define "almost full" as remaining capacity `r` such that `item <= r < item + threshold`.
    # For such bins, we want to give a high priority, especially to those with smaller `r`.
    
    # Consider the inverse of the remaining capacity if the item fits.
    # The bin with the *smallest* remaining capacity that can fit the item is the "most almost full".
    
    # So, for bins that can fit:
    # Priority = 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] + epsilon)
    # This will give higher priority to bins with *smaller* remaining capacity.
    # We want the *smallest* remaining capacity that is still *greater than or equal to* item.
    
    # Let's simplify: Prioritize bins that have the least amount of "wasted" space.
    # The wasted space is (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) for bins where item fits.
    # We want to MINIMIZE this waste. Thus, we want to MAXIMIZE a value related to the negative of this waste.
    # Or, simply, we want to pick the bin with the smallest `bins_remain_cap[i]` among those that fit.
    
    # Let's try a direct inverse relationship with the remaining capacity for fitting bins.
    # Higher priority for smaller remaining capacities.
    
    # This directly implements "Best Fit" logic. For "Almost Full Fit", we want
    # to target bins that are *already* quite full.
    
    # A common interpretation of "Almost Full Fit" or "Worst Fit Decreasing" (though we are online here)
    # is to try to leave larger spaces for larger items. So, we'd put the current item
    # into a bin that leaves the *largest* remaining capacity, *if it fits*.
    # This is the opposite of what's implied by "almost full".
    
    # Let's re-read: "The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item."
    # "Almost Full Fit strategy" for online BPP.
    # This usually means filling bins as much as possible. So we prefer bins that are nearly full.
    
    # A higher priority should be given to bins that have just enough space,
    # or are closest to being full but can still fit the item.
    
    # Let's consider the difference: `diff = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want `diff` to be as small and non-negative as possible.
    # So, a score like `1 / (1 + diff)` would work.
    
    # However, the term "Almost Full Fit" can also imply giving preference to bins
    # that have been used more. In an online scenario, this means bins with less remaining capacity.
    
    # Let's use the negative of the remaining capacity, but only for bins that can fit.
    # For bins that can fit, a lower remaining capacity is better (more "almost full").
    # We want to MAXIMIZE the priority. So, we want to MAXIMIZE `-bins_remain_cap`.
    # Or, equivalently, MINIMIZE `bins_remain_cap`.
    
    # If we want to specifically target bins that are "almost full" (meaning their capacity is
    # relatively small, but still fits the item), we could score based on the inverse of the remaining capacity.
    
    # A simple way to implement "almost full" is to look at bins that are already fairly full.
    # If `bins_remain_cap` is `[10, 5, 2, 8]` and `item` is `3`.
    # Fits in: Bin 0 (rem 7), Bin 1 (rem 2), Bin 3 (rem 5).
    # The "most almost full" that fits is Bin 1 (rem 2).
    # So, we want to pick the bin with the smallest `bins_remain_cap` that is `>= item`.
    
    # This is equivalent to Best Fit. If the problem statement means something else by "Almost Full Fit"
    # that differentiates it from Best Fit, it's not immediately obvious.
    
    # Let's assume "Almost Full Fit" means prioritizing bins with smaller remaining capacities
    # that can still fit the item. This is essentially Best Fit.
    
    # If we need to be more nuanced about "almost full", maybe we consider bins
    # where `bins_remain_cap` is large, but only slightly larger than `item`.
    
    # Let's create a priority that is high for bins where `bins_remain_cap` is just a bit larger than `item`.
    # `priority = max(0, 1 - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) / some_large_capacity)`
    
    # Let's stick to the interpretation: prioritize bins that, after placing the item, will have the smallest remaining capacity.
    # This means finding the bin with the minimum `bins_remain_cap` such that `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    
    # To achieve this with a highest-priority-wins system:
    # For bins that can fit, assign a priority that is inversely related to their remaining capacity.
    # `priority = 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] + epsilon)`
    # This rewards smaller remaining capacities.
    
    # Let's try a scoring function where bins that can fit get a score proportional to how 'full' they are,
    # but we also need to ensure they can fit.
    
    # Consider bins_remain_cap = [10, 8, 6, 4, 2], item = 3
    # Fits in: [10, 8, 6, 4] -> remain_caps: [7, 5, 3, 1]
    # The most "almost full" that fits is bin with remaining capacity 1.
    # So we want to maximize a score that is achieved by the smallest valid `bins_remain_cap`.
    
    # Let's assign a priority that is simply the negative of the remaining capacity,
    # but only for those bins that can accommodate the item.
    # For bins that cannot fit, their priority should be very low.

        # Score = 1.0 / (epsilon + (bins_remain_cap[i] - item))
        # where epsilon is a small constant to avoid division by zero.

        # Fits: [10, 8, 6, 4]
        # Scores: -(10-3), -(8-3), -(6-3), -(4-3)  -> [-7, -5, -3, -1]
        # Max score is -1, which corresponds to the bin with remaining capacity 4. This is the Best Fit.
        
        # If "Almost Full Fit" means preferring bins that have a capacity *just slightly larger than the item*,
        # we might need a different approach.
        
        # Let's consider a scenario where we prioritize bins that are closer to being full overall,
        # but not *too* full that they can't fit the item.
        
        # If the problem implies preferring bins that have *more* remaining capacity
        # (so as to leave them "almost full" for future larger items), that would be Worst Fit.
        # However, "Almost Full Fit" usually implies the opposite: filling bins up.
        
        # Let's try to assign higher priority to bins that are *already* very full,
        # and can still fit the item.
        # If remaining capacity is `r`, we want to prioritize small `r` such that `r >= item`.
        
        # Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of "Almost Full Fit".
        # It often means to put the item into the bin that has the least free space *but can still accommodate the item*.
        # This is synonymous with the Best Fit heuristic.
        
        # So, we want to find the bin `j` that minimizes `bins_remain_cap[j] - item`
        # subject to `bins_remain_cap[j] >= item`.
        
        # To convert this minimization into a maximization problem for priority:
        # `priority[j] = 1 / ( (bins_remain_cap[j] - item) + epsilon )`
        # or
        # `priority[j] = -(bins_remain_cap[j] - item)`
        
        # Let's use the negative difference as the priority.
        # Higher values of `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` mean smaller `bins_remain_cap - item`.
        
        # Example: bins_remain_cap = [10, 8, 6, 4], item = 3
        # Fits: [10, 8, 6, 4]
        # Scores = [-(10-3), -(8-3), -(6-3), -(4-3)] = [-7, -5, -3, -1]
        # Max score is -1, corresponds to bin with remaining capacity 4. This is Best Fit.
        
        # Let's try a different angle for "Almost Full Fit".
        # Maybe it's about maximizing the 'fullness' of the bin *before* placing the item.
        # A bin is "almost full" if its `bins_remain_cap` is small.
        # So, we want to prioritize bins with small `bins_remain_cap`, provided they fit.
        
        # Let's assign priority `1 / bins_remain_cap[i]` for bins that fit.
        # This rewards smaller remaining capacities.

        # Fits: [10, 8, 6, 4]

            # If `bins_remain_cap` is much larger than `item`, we might not want it.
            
            # Let's define a score that is higher for bins with small `bins_remain_cap` (fitting),
            # but also has some nuance to "almost full".
            
            # Consider the difference `d = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.

            # Define "close" as `item <= bins_remain_cap < item + margin`.
            
            # Let `score = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`
            # If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is in `[item, item + margin)`, add a bonus.
            
            # Let's consider a score based on the amount of space left *after* placing the item.
            # We want to minimize this leftover space.
            # So, we prioritize bins that result in the minimum `bins_remain_cap - item`.
            
            # The priority can be calculated as:
            # `priority = M - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`
            # where M is a large constant to ensure positive priorities, and we want to MAXIMIZE this.
            # This is equivalent to minimizing `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
            
            # So, a direct assignment of `-bins_remain_cap[i]` for fitting bins works if
            # we want to pick the one with least remaining capacity overall.
            
            # However, for "Almost Full Fit", a typical strategy is to put the item into the bin
            # that has the most remaining capacity that fits the item (Worst Fit), or the least (Best Fit).
            # "Almost Full" usually implies filling up bins, hence Best Fit.

            # Let's interpret "Almost Full Fit" as prioritizing the bin that has the LEAST remaining capacity,
            # but is still able to fit the item. This is Best Fit.
            
            # The priority should be maximized for bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is minimized.
            # So, `priority = C - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` or `priority = -bins_remain_cap[i]`.
            
            # Let's make it so that a bin with remaining capacity `item` gets the highest priority.
            # And a bin with `item + X` gets a lower priority, inversely proportional to `X`.
            
            # A standard "almost full" heuristic in packing might involve fitting into bins
            # that are already reasonably full.
            
            # Let's refine: We want bins where `bins_remain_cap` is "small" but fits `item`.

            # Max priority is -4, corresponding to bin with initial capacity 4.
            # This is indeed Best Fit.
            
            # If the problem intends a different "Almost Full Fit" (e.g. avoiding bins that are too full),
            # this heuristic would need adjustment. But based on standard packing heuristics,
            # "almost full" usually aligns with filling bins efficiently, which Best Fit does.
            
            # Let's try to boost bins that are "almost full" in the sense of having low remaining capacity *initially*.
            # And then, among those, pick the best fit.
            
            # Define "almost full" bins as those where `bins_remain_cap < threshold`.
            # `threshold = average_remaining_capacity` ?
            
            # Let's use the most straightforward "Almost Full" interpretation: prioritize bins that are already most full (least remaining capacity).
            # This means we want the bin with the minimum `bins_remain_cap` that fits the item.
            
            # Priority = `-bins_remain_cap[i]` for fitting bins.
            # This maximizes priority for smallest `bins_remain_cap`.
            
            # Example: bins_remain_cap = [10, 8, 6, 4], item = 3
            # Fits: [10, 8, 6, 4]
            # Priorities: [-10, -8, -6, -4]
            # Max is -4, corresponding to bin with capacity 4.
            
            # This is equivalent to Best Fit. Let's use this.
            # If there's a specific nuanced definition of "Almost Full Fit", it's not immediately apparent.
            # This strategy aims to fill bins, thus making them "almost full" by leaving less space.
            
            # However, a true "Almost Full Fit" might want to *select* bins that are already "almost full",
            # i.e., their current remaining capacity is small.
            # So, we want to prioritize bins where `bins_remain_cap` is small, provided they fit.
            
            # This is directly achieved by `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[i] + epsilon)` for fitting bins.

            priorities[fitting_indices] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[fitting_indices] + epsilon_small)
            
            # Final consideration: "Almost Full Fit" vs. "Best Fit".
            # Best Fit minimizes `r - i`. Priority `-(r - i)`. Max score for min `r-i`.
            # Almost Full Fit could mean: prioritize bins that are already "almost full".

### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize clarity and specific strategies (like exact fits). Vectorized operations are key for performance. Nuanced mathematical transformations (sigmoid, exponentials) can capture complex preferences but require careful tuning. Avoid overly simplistic heuristics or arbitrary thresholds.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    suitable_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities[suitable_bins_mask] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask] - item + 1e-9)
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    epsilon = 0.1
    best_fit_bin_idx = np.argmax(bins_remain_cap >= item)
    
    for i in range(len(bins_remain_cap)):
        if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:
            remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap[i] - item
            priorities[i] = remaining_cap
        else:
            priorities[i] = -float('inf')
            
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        random_bin_idx = np.random.choice(np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0])
        priorities[random_bin_idx] = 1e9
    else:
        if np.any(bins_remain_cap >= item):
            priorities[best_fit_bin_idx] += (priorities.max() - priorities[best_fit_bin_idx]) * 0.5

    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing Heuristic 1 (Exact Fit First) and Heuristic 2 (Best Fit): Heuristic 1 prioritizes exact fits and then falls back to First Fit, while Heuristic 2 strictly implements Best Fit. Heuristic 1's explicit handling of exact fits and fallback logic seems more robust for certain scenarios than a pure Best Fit.

Comparing Heuristic 1 and Heuristic 6 (Inverse of Remaining Capacity): Heuristic 1 offers a more sophisticated priority system with distinct cases (exact fit, then first fit). Heuristic 6 simply uses `1 / (remaining_capacity - item)`, which is a form of Best Fit but lacks the specific exact-fit advantage of Heuristic 1.

Comparing Heuristic 2 (Best Fit) and Heuristic 8 (Loop-based Best Fit): Heuristic 2 uses vectorized NumPy operations for efficiency, while Heuristic 8 uses a Python loop. Vectorization is generally preferred for performance in numerical computations. The logic is similar.

Comparing Heuristic 6 and Heuristic 11 (Identical): Heuristics 6 and 11 are identical. Both implement Best Fit by prioritizing bins with the least remaining capacity using the inverse of `(remaining_capacity - item)`.

Comparing Heuristic 7 and Heuristic 10 (Identical): Heuristics 7 and 10 are identical. They use an exponential decay based on the mean relative capacity, aiming to balance fits but potentially being sensitive to outliers.

Comparing Heuristic 5 (Sigmoid Fit Score) and Heuristic 12 (Scaled Sigmoid): Heuristic 12 uses a more carefully tuned sigmoid function with scaling parameters based on the range of valid fits. Heuristic 5's sigmoid scaling is fixed, making Heuristic 12 likely more adaptable to different data distributions.

Comparing Heuristic 16 (Remaining Capacity) and Heuristic 18 (Identical): Heuristics 16 and 18 simply return the remaining capacity if the item fits, otherwise -1. This is a very basic heuristic and doesn't actively try to optimize packing beyond identifying bins that can fit.

Comparing Heuristic 13 (Relative Capacity) and Heuristic 17 (Normalized Exponential Relative Capacity): Heuristic 13 uses a simple ratio `(remaining - item) / remaining`. Heuristic 17 uses an exponential of the relative capacity, normalized across fitting bins. Heuristic 17's approach seems to give stronger preference to tighter fits via exponentiation.

Overall: Heuristics that combine explicit strategies like exact fits with fallback mechanisms (e.g., Heuristic 1) or use well-tuned mathematical transformations (e.g., Heuristic 12's scaled sigmoid) appear more robust. Simple implementations of Best Fit (e.g., Heuristic 6, 11) are effective but less nuanced. Heuristics with simple negative remaining capacity or fixed scaling (e.g., 16, 18, 5) are less sophisticated.

Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Precision, Adaptability, Explainability, Performance.
*   **Advice:** Focus on mechanisms that allow heuristics to adapt to varying data distributions and problem complexities. Document the reasoning behind each heuristic component for maintainability and debugging.
*   **Avoid:** "Black box" logic or overly rigid rules that don't account for edge cases or evolving data. Avoid introducing complexity without a clear performance or accuracy benefit.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection in heuristic design means understanding *why* a strategy works, its limitations, and how it can be improved. It's about building intelligent, interpretable, and robust solutions, not just fast ones.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Combines Best Fit with a penalty for bins with too much excess capacity.
    Prioritizes bins that are a tight fit, penalizing those with large gaps.
    This aims for better space utilization by avoiding overly large remaining spaces.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    suitable_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    if not np.any(suitable_bins_mask):
        return priorities

    suitable_bins_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask]
    
    # Calculate inverse of remaining capacity (similar to Best Fit)
    # Adding a small epsilon to avoid division by zero if remaining_cap == item
    inverse_remaining = 1.0 / (suitable_bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)
    
    # Calculate a penalty for bins with a large gap (excess capacity)
    # Using a sigmoid-like function to penalize larger gaps more significantly
    # Normalize remaining capacity to a 0-1 scale for the penalty function
    max_suitable_cap = np.max(suitable_bins_remain_cap)
    min_suitable_cap = np.min(suitable_bins_remain_cap)
    
    # Avoid division by zero if all suitable bins have the same capacity
    if max_suitable_cap == min_suitable_cap:
        normalized_excess = np.zeros_like(suitable_bins_remain_cap)
    else:
        # Capacity of the bin relative to the range of suitable capacities
        # We want to penalize bins with capacity much larger than the item
        # Focus on the gap: suitable_bins_remain_cap - item
        excess_capacity = suitable_bins_remain_cap - item
        normalized_excess = excess_capacity / (max_suitable_cap - item + 1e-9) # Normalize by max possible excess
        
    # Apply a penalty: higher penalty for larger normalized excess
    # A simple inverse of the normalized excess can work as a penalty,
    # or a more aggressive function like exp(-k * normalized_excess)
    # Let's use a simple inverse for now, penalizing bins with larger excess
    # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero for bins that are exact fits after normalization
    penalty = 1.0 / (normalized_excess + 0.1) 
    
    # Combine the "Best Fit" score with the penalty
    # We want to favor smaller remaining capacities (high inverse_remaining)
    # and penalize larger excess capacities (low penalty value, as penalty is 1/(normalized_excess+c))
    # So, we want to maximize inverse_remaining and minimize penalty
    # A simple combination: inverse_remaining / penalty (effectively inverse_remaining * (normalized_excess + c))
    # This gives higher scores to bins that are tight fits AND don't have excessive space after fitting.
    priorities[suitable_bins_mask] = inverse_remaining * penalty
    
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Precision, Adaptability, Explainability, Performance.
*   **Advice:** Focus on mechanisms that allow heuristics to adapt to varying data distributions and problem complexities. Document the reasoning behind each heuristic component for maintainability and debugging.
*   **Avoid:** "Black box" logic or overly rigid rules that don't account for edge cases or evolving data. Avoid introducing complexity without a clear performance or accuracy benefit.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection in heuristic design means understanding *why* a strategy works, its limitations, and how it can be improved. It's about building intelligent, interpretable, and robust solutions, not just fast ones.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    Combines Best Fit with a dynamic penalty based on the item size relative to bin capacity.
    Prioritizes bins that offer a "near-perfect" fit without excessive leftover space,
    dynamically adjusting the penalty based on how "tight" the fit is.
    This aims for better space utilization by being more sensitive to the actual item size.

    Args:
        item: The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A numpy array representing the remaining capacity of each bin.
        epsilon: A small constant to prevent division by zero or log of zero.
        penalty_offset: A constant added to the denominator in the penalty calculation to avoid issues with very tight fits and control penalty aggressiveness.

    Returns:
        A numpy array representing the priority score for each bin.

    # "Best Fit" component: Prioritize bins with minimum remaining capacity after packing.

    # Using log to compress the range and emphasize smaller differences.
    best_fit_score = -np.log(suitable_bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)
    
    # Dynamic Penalty component: Penalize bins with significantly more capacity than needed.
    # The penalty is higher when the "excess capacity" (remaining_cap - item) is large
    # relative to the item's size. This makes the penalty scale with the item's magnitude.
    
    # Calculate excess ratio: (remaining_cap - item) / item.
    # A bin with exact fit has excess_ratio = 0. A bin with large excess has large excess_ratio.
    # We want to penalize large excess_ratio. So, a good penalty multiplier would be 1 / (excess_ratio + C).
    # The smaller the `1 / (excess_ratio + C)`, the worse the bin.
    # So, we want to maximize `best_fit_score` and maximize `1 / (excess_ratio + C)`.
    # Thus, we can multiply them.
    
    excess_ratio = (suitable_bins_remain_cap - item) / (item + epsilon)

    penalty_multiplier = 1.0 / (excess_ratio + penalty_offset)
    
    # Final priority is the product of the best-fit score proxy and the penalty multiplier.
    # Higher best_fit_score is good. Higher penalty_multiplier is good (means low excess ratio).

    Combines Best Fit and Worst Fit principles with a dynamic "gap" penalty.
    Prioritizes bins that minimize remaining capacity (Best Fit), but also considers

    # 1. Exact Fit: Give a very high priority to bins that fit the item perfectly
    #    to avoid any waste in that specific bin. This is crucial for overall efficiency.
    # 2. Most Full (Preference for less empty bins): Favor bins that are already
    #    closer to capacity. This can help consolidate items and potentially open
    #    fewer new bins. Modeled as 1 / (initial remaining capacity + epsilon).
    # 3. Tightest Fit (Best Fit): After considering fullness, prioritize bins that
    #    leave minimal remaining capacity after the item is packed. This minimizes
    #    immediate waste. Modeled as - (remaining capacity - item).
    # 4. Weighted Combination: Combine 'Most Full' and 'Tightest Fit' preferences
    #    using weights to balance their contributions. A slightly higher weight
    #    for 'Most Full' encourages denser packing across bins, while 'Tightest Fit'
    #    ensures efficient use of the chosen bin.

    # A larger suitable_bins_remain_cap relative to 'item' leads to a smaller tightness_ratio,

    # A simple subtraction works if interpreted as score = bf_score - penalty.
    # Alternatively, we can multiply if penalties were designed as multipliers.
    # Here, we aim for a higher combined score. Since `best_fit_score` is already a maximization proxy,
    # and `penalty_component` is something we want to minimize (i.e., a higher penalty is bad),
    # we subtract the penalty.
    
    # To make it a maximization problem directly, we can express it as:
    # Score = best_fit_score - penalty_component
    # or, if we want to penalize the penalty:
    # Score = best_fit_score * (1 / (penalty_component + epsilon)) which is equivalent to
    # Score = best_fit_score * tightness_ratio (approximately)
    # Let's use a multiplicative approach where a higher `penalty_component` reduces the score.
    # A simple way to combine: maximize `best_fit_score` and maximize `1 / (penalty_component + epsilon)`
    # This means maximizing `best_fit_score * (tightness_ratio)`.
    
    # Let's refine the penalty: Penalize bins where `remaining_cap - item` is large relative to `item`.
    # Consider `excess_ratio = (remaining_cap - item) / item`. We want to penalize high `excess_ratio`.
    # Penalty_score = 1 / (excess_ratio + 1).
    # This is similar to the tightness ratio logic but framed differently.
    
    excess_ratio = (suitable_bins_remain_cap - item) / (item + 1e-9)
    # A bin with exact fit has excess_ratio = 0. A bin with large excess has large excess_ratio.
    # We want to penalize large excess_ratio. So, a good penalty multiplier would be 1 / (excess_ratio + C).
    # The smaller the `1 / (excess_ratio + C)`, the worse the bin.
    # So, we want to maximize `best_fit_score` and maximize `1 / (excess_ratio + C)`.
    # Thus, we can multiply them.
    
    penalty_multiplier = 1.0 / (excess_ratio + 0.2) # Add 0.2 to ensure it's not too aggressive.
    
    # Final priority is the product of the best-fit score proxy and the penalty multiplier.
    # Higher best_fit_score is good. Higher penalty_multiplier is good (means low excess ratio).
