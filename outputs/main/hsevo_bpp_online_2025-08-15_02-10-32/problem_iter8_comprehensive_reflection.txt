Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Robustness, adaptability, clarity, parsimony, performance, objective function.
*   **Advice:** Focus on designing heuristics with clear, interpretable objective functions that can adapt to varying problem states (e.g., item sizes, bin utilization). Prioritize vectorized implementations for efficiency.
*   **Avoid:** Redundant or overly complex metric combinations, arbitrary thresholds, and heuristics that don't demonstrably improve performance across a range of scenarios.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection means identifying core principles of good heuristic design (like clarity and adaptability) and ruthlessly eliminating elements that introduce complexity without clear benefit, ensuring robustness and efficient execution.
