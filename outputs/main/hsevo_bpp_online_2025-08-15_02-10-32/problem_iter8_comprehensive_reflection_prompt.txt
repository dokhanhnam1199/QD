{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize explicit handling of exact fits. Combine multiple metrics (Best Fit, Fill Ratio, Slack) multiplicatively or additively with weights. Introduce adaptive components based on item size or bin state for robustness. Avoid overly complex interactions or redundant metrics. Simplicity and clear objective functions often lead to better heuristic design.\nPrioritize clarity and specific strategies (like exact fits). Vectorized operations are key for performance. Nuanced mathematical transformations (sigmoid, exponentials) can capture complex preferences but require careful tuning. Avoid overly simplistic heuristics or arbitrary thresholds.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize exact fits. Combine \"tightness of fit\" (e.g., `1/(remaining-item)`) with \"fill ratio\" (e.g., `item/remaining`) multiplicatively. Penalize bins with disproportionately large initial capacities. Avoid overly complex scaling or normalization if simpler direct combinations suffice.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
