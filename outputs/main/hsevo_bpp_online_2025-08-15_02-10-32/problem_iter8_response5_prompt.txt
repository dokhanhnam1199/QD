Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The ranking suggests a subtle difference in conceptualization, not implementation.\n\nComparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the code is identical. The ranking is arbitrary or based on external factors not evident from the code.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th): Heuristic 3 attempts to combine \"Best Fit\" with a penalty for large excess capacity relative to item size using a `tightness_ratio` and `penalty_component`. Heuristic 4 introduces \"Worst Fit\" concepts and a \"dynamic gap penalty,\" but its implementation primarily focuses on `best_fit_score * gap_management_score`, where `gap_management_score` is `1.0 / (1.0 + (gap / item))`. Heuristic 3's penalty is more directly tied to the `remaining_cap - item` ratio, whereas Heuristic 4 uses `item / (remaining_cap)`. The core idea of penalizing large gaps is similar, but Heuristic 4's `gap_management_score` might be more stable for very small items.\n\nComparing (4th) vs (5th): Heuristic 4 uses a multiplicative combination of Best Fit and a gap management score. Heuristic 5 introduces a sigmoid for tight fits and a penalty for large initial capacities, combining them multiplicatively. Heuristic 5's sigmoid introduces non-linearity, potentially offering smoother preferences for tight fits. Heuristic 4's approach is more directly interpretable as Best Fit scaled by a tightness factor.\n\nComparing (5th) vs (6th): Heuristic 5 uses a sigmoid and a simple inverse capacity penalty. Heuristic 6 prioritizes exact fits with a very high score and then uses exponential decay based on normalized slack for non-exact fits. Heuristic 6's explicit handling of exact fits is a strong point, but its normalization of slack might be sensitive to extreme values.\n\nComparing (6th) vs (7th): Heuristic 6 has explicit exact fit handling and exponential decay. Heuristic 7 also prioritizes exact fits (with a slightly lower score) and then combines Best Fit (`1.0 / (remaining_capacities_after_fit)`) with a preference for \"almost full\" bins (using `1.0 / (suitable_capacities)`). Heuristic 7's additive combination of these two preferences, weighted, offers a different balance.\n\nComparing (7th) vs (8th): Heuristics 7 and 8 are identical.\n\nComparing (8th) vs (9th): Heuristic 8 uses a sigmoid for tight fits and an inverse capacity penalty. Heuristic 9 combines a tightness score (`1.0 / slack`) with a fill ratio (`item / remaining_cap`), using multiplication. Heuristic 9's multiplicative approach is more direct in rewarding both tight fits and good item utilization within the bin.\n\nComparing (9th) vs (10th): Heuristic 9 multiplies tightness and fill ratio. Heuristic 10 does the same but adds an \"almost full\" bonus, which is essentially another term favoring bins with low initial remaining capacity. The additive bonus provides an additional layer of preference.\n\nComparing (10th) vs (11th): Heuristic 10 combines efficiency (tightness * fill ratio) with an \"almost full\" bonus additively. Heuristic 11 uses a weighted additive combination of \"almost full\" preference and \"tightest fit\" preference. Heuristic 11's explicit weighting of preferences is more structured than Heuristic 10's additive bonus.\n\nComparing (11th) vs (12th): Heuristics 11 and 12 are identical.\n\nComparing (12th) vs (13th): Heuristics 12 and 13 are identical.\n\nComparing (13th) vs (14th): Heuristic 13 is identical to 11 and 12. Heuristic 14 introduces an \"adaptive Best Fit\" by dynamically weighting a tightness component based on the item's size relative to average remaining capacity. It also uses a log-based best-fit score. This adaptivity is a novel aspect.\n\nComparing (14th) vs (15th): Heuristics 14 and 15 are identical.\n\nComparing (15th) vs (16th): Heuristic 15 is identical to 14. Heuristic 16 combines Best Fit (log scale) with a refined slack minimization and a fill ratio component, using multiplication. It also introduces a `slack_decay_factor` (`exp(-relative_slack)`). This multiplicative approach with an exponential decay is a strong combination.\n\nComparing (16th) vs (17th): Heuristics 16 and 17 are identical.\n\nComparing (17th) vs (18th): Heuristics 17 and 18 are identical.\n\nComparing (18th) vs (19th): Heuristic 18 is identical to 16 and 17. Heuristic 19 attempts to combine Best Fit, an adaptive slack penalty (normalized by average excess capacity), and a uniformity score (penalizing deviation from average remaining capacity). This multi-faceted approach aims for more balanced packing.\n\nComparing (19th) vs (20th): Heuristic 19 combines Best Fit (log), adaptive slack penalty, and uniformity. Heuristic 20 combines Best Fit (log), fullness score (inverse capacity), multiplicatively. Heuristic 19's attempt at adaptivity and uniformity suggests a more sophisticated strategy than Heuristic 20's simpler multiplicative combination.\n\nOverall, heuristics that explicitly handle exact fits (6, 7), use adaptive weights or penalties based on item size or system state (14, 15, 19), or combine multiple strong metrics multiplicatively with decay functions (16, 17, 18) appear to be conceptually superior. The ranking seems to generally increase in complexity and adaptivity up to a point, then potentially plateau or slightly decline in perceived quality.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Robustness, adaptability, clarity, parsimony, performance, objective function.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on designing heuristics with clear, interpretable objective functions that can adapt to varying problem states (e.g., item sizes, bin utilization). Prioritize vectorized implementations for efficiency.\n*   **Avoid:** Redundant or overly complex metric combinations, arbitrary thresholds, and heuristics that don't demonstrably improve performance across a range of scenarios.\n*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection means identifying core principles of good heuristic design (like clarity and adaptability) and ruthlessly eliminating elements that introduce complexity without clear benefit, ensuring robustness and efficient execution.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
