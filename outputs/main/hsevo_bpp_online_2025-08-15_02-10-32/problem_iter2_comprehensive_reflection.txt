Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Precision, Adaptability, Explainability, Performance.
*   **Advice:** Focus on mechanisms that allow heuristics to adapt to varying data distributions and problem complexities. Document the reasoning behind each heuristic component for maintainability and debugging.
*   **Avoid:** "Black box" logic or overly rigid rules that don't account for edge cases or evolving data. Avoid introducing complexity without a clear performance or accuracy benefit.
*   **Explanation:** True self-reflection in heuristic design means understanding *why* a strategy works, its limitations, and how it can be improved. It's about building intelligent, interpretable, and robust solutions, not just fast ones.
