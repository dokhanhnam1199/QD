    Best Fit strategy for online Bin Packing Problem.

    Calculates priority for each bin based on how well the item fits.
    A higher priority is given to bins where the remaining capacity
    after placing the item is minimized, thus aiming for the "best fit".
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    # Calculate potential remaining capacity if item fits
    potential_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Assign a high priority to bins that can accommodate the item
    # and a low priority to bins that cannot.
    # Among bins that can accommodate, we want the one that leaves
    # the least remaining space (best fit).
    # We can achieve this by prioritizing bins with a smaller positive
    # potential_remain_cap.
    # For bins where potential_remain_cap is negative (item doesn't fit),
    # we assign a very low priority (effectively 0 or less).

    # For bins where the item fits (potential_remain_cap >= 0):
    # We want to minimize potential_remain_cap. A simple way is to use
    # a large number minus the potential_remain_cap.
    # However, to avoid overflow and keep it simple, we can assign
    # a value inversely proportional to the remaining capacity after fit.
    # A negative value for potential_remain_cap means the item doesn't fit.
    # So, we only consider positive potential_remain_cap.

    # A common approach for best fit is to maximize -abs(remaining_capacity - item)
    # or in this case, maximize the negative of the remaining capacity after fitting,
    # but only for bins where it fits.

    # Let's try to assign a high score to the smallest positive remaining capacity.
    # If potential_remain_cap is positive, the score could be related to -potential_remain_cap.
    # For bins where item does not fit (potential_remain_cap < 0), the priority should be very low.

    # We can use a value that is large if it fits, and small if it doesn't.
    # Among those that fit, the "best fit" would be the one with the smallest positive remaining capacity.
    # Let's map smaller positive remaining capacities to higher priority scores.
    # A simple mapping could be: 1 / (1 + potential_remain_cap) for valid fits.
    # And a very low value for invalid fits.

    # Consider bins where item fits (bins_remain_cap >= item)
    fits_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    # For bins that fit, calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item.
    # We want the bin with the minimum remaining capacity.
    # To convert minimum remaining capacity to a maximum priority, we can use
    # a transformation. For example, -remaining_capacity.
    # To ensure positive values and highlight smaller remaining capacities,
    # we can use a large constant minus remaining capacity.
    # Or even better, use a function that gives higher values for smaller positive inputs.
    
    # Example strategy: Assign priority as (max_capacity + 1 - item - bin_cap_after_fit)
    # This would be `max_possible_remaining_space` - `actual_remaining_space`
    # To keep it simple and directly related to "best fit":
    # Priority = -(remaining_capacity_after_item)
    # This way, the smallest positive remaining capacity will be the least negative number, thus the maximum.

    # Calculate remaining capacity if the item fits
    remaining_if_fit = bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] - item
    
    # Assign priorities to bins that can fit the item
    # Higher priority for smaller remaining capacity.
    # Use negative of remaining capacity, so smaller positive values become larger negative values (higher priority).
    # To make it more intuitive (higher score for better fit), we can use
    # something like: (some_large_value) - remaining_capacity
    # Let's use the maximum possible remaining space as the reference.
    # A very large number representing total capacity could be used, but
    # let's stick to a relative scale.
    # A simple strategy: prioritize the bin that has the *least* leftover space.
    # So if remaining capacity is R, priority could be -R.
    
    priorities[fits_mask] = -remaining_if_fit
    
    # For bins that do not fit, their priority is essentially zero or very low.
    # By default, priorities are initialized to zero, which is fine here as
    # negative priorities will be chosen over zero.
    
    # Another approach to ensure positive scores if preferred, but not required by problem statement:
    # if fits_mask.any():
    #     min_remaining = np.min(remaining_if_fit)
    #     # Normalize or scale remaining capacities so smaller is better
    #     # A simple approach is to use a large number minus the remaining capacity
    #     # Example: Prioritize by (BinCapacity - item - actual_remaining_after_fit)
    #     # where BinCapacity is the original capacity (not given directly here)
    #     # or by a constant that is larger than any possible remaining capacity.
    #     # If we consider max possible remaining capacity before fitting, it's the item size itself.
    #     # Let's use a large number, say 1000, and subtract the remaining capacity.
    #     # priorities[fits_mask] = 1000 - remaining_if_fit

    # The negative of the remaining capacity directly achieves the goal:
    # smaller positive remaining_if_fit -> larger negative priority -> higher preference.
