Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, empirical validation, component interaction, adaptability.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how heuristic components *interact* and *evolve* during search. Design for *adaptability* based on problem instance characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on fixed mathematical combinations or static penalties.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of solely prioritizing fixed metrics like "tightness" or "fill ratio," continuously evaluate their effectiveness *in conjunction* throughout the heuristic's execution. Tune component weights or logic dynamically, rather than with static formulas.
