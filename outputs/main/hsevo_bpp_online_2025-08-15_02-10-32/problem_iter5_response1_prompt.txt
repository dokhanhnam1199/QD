Heuristic 1's score `best_fit_score * penalty_multiplier` (where `penalty_multiplier = 1.0 / (excess_ratio + 0.2)`) appears more direct in penalizing bins with large excess capacity relative to item size.\n\nComparing Heuristic 3 vs Heuristic 7 (which are identical): Both use `fill_ratio * tightness` as their score, which is `item / (suitable_bins_remain_cap * (suitable_bins_remain_cap - item) + 1e-9)`. This score effectively balances the tightness of the fit with how much of the remaining space the item occupies, and it implicitly penalizes bins with large `suitable_bins_remain_cap`.\n\nComparing Heuristic 4 vs Heuristic 9 (which are identical): Both use a sigmoid function based on normalized slack. Heuristic 4 maps `max_slack - slack` to the sigmoid, aiming for higher scores for smaller slack. Heuristic 9 directly uses `differences * scale_factor` as the sigmoid input, achieving a similar goal.\n\nComparing Heuristic 5 vs Heuristic 6 (which are identical): Both prioritize exact fits with a high score, then use inverse remaining capacity for non-exact fits, normalizing these scores. This is a robust approach for prioritizing exact fits.\n\nComparing Heuristic 10 vs Heuristic 11/12: Heuristic 10 uses a product of Best Fit, Excess Capacity Penalty, and Distributional Balancing. Heuristics 11/12 combine Best Fit with a preference for \"almost full\" bins using a weighted sum. Heuristic 11/12's direct combination of `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon_small)` and `0.5 * (-remaining_after_fit)` seems more straightforward than Heuristic 10's multiplicative approach with potentially complex interactions.\n\nComparing Heuristic 13/14/15 vs Heuristic 16: Heuristics 13/14/15 prioritize exact fits (score 1.0) and then use an exponential decay `exp(-relative_capacities / mean_relative_capacity)` for non-exact fits. Heuristic 16 prioritizes exact fits with a high score and uses `exp(-scaled_relative_capacities)` for non-exact fits, where `scaled_relative_capacities` is normalized between 0 and 1. Heuristic 16's normalization and conditional scaling might lead to more stable and comparable scores.\n\nComparing Heuristic 17/18 vs Heuristic 19/20: Heuristics 17/18 use a sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(-scaled_differences))` based on the negative difference for tight fits. Heuristics 19/20 use `exp(remaining_capacities)` scaled and normalized, which seems to amplify the preference for tighter fits directly. The sigmoid in 17/18 might offer smoother control.\n\nOverall: Heuristics focusing on multiplicative combinations of \"tightness\" (like `1/(rem-item)`) and \"fill ratio\" (like `item/rem`), or those that directly penalize large initial remaining capacities, seem most promising for balancing fit quality and overall bin utilization. Exact fit prioritization is also a strong strategy. The complexity of penalties and normalizations can sometimes obscure the intended behavior.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, empirical validation, component interaction, adaptability.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on how heuristic components *interact* and *evolve* during search. Design for *adaptability* based on problem instance characteristics.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on fixed mathematical combinations or static penalties.\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of solely prioritizing fixed metrics like \"tightness\" or \"fill ratio,\" continuously evaluate their effectiveness *in conjunction* throughout the heuristic's execution. Tune component weights or logic dynamically, rather than with static formulas.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
