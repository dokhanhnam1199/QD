Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines Best Fit with a dynamic penalty based on the item size relative to bin capacity.\n    Prioritizes bins that offer a \"near-perfect\" fit without excessive leftover space,\n    dynamically adjusting the penalty based on how \"tight\" the fit is.\n    This aims for better space utilization by being more sensitive to the actual item size.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    suitable_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if not np.any(suitable_bins_mask):\n        return priorities\n\n    suitable_bins_remain_cap = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins_mask]\n    \n    # \"Best Fit\" component: Prioritize bins with minimum remaining capacity after packing.\n    # We use the negative of the remaining capacity to transform minimization into maximization.\n    # Add a small epsilon to ensure no division by zero or log(0) if remaining_cap == item.\n    # Using log to compress the range and emphasize smaller differences.\n    best_fit_score = -np.log(suitable_bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)\n    \n    # Dynamic Penalty component: Penalize bins with significantly more capacity than needed.\n    # The penalty is higher when the \"excess capacity\" (remaining_cap - item) is large\n    # relative to the item's size.

Design for *adaptability* based on problem instance characteristics.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on fixed mathematical combinations or static penalties.\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of solely prioritizing fixed metrics like \"tightness\" or \"fill ratio,\" continuously evaluate their effectiveness *in conjunction* throughout the heuristic's execution. Tune component weights or logic dynamically, rather than with static formulas.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
