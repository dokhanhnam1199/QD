*   **Keywords**: Direct, Greedy, Simplicity, Waste Minimization, Fixed.
*   **Advice**: Prioritize direct waste minimization with immediate, greedy choices. Apply only fixed, additive adjustments for highly desirable, simple outcomes like perfect fits.
*   **Avoid**: Complex, non-linear, or multiplicative scoring; adaptive parameters; explicit fragmentation penalties or bin balancing; general numerical robustness as a design principle.
*   **Explanation**: Effective heuristics remain simple, direct, and focused on immediate optimal outcomes. Overcomplicating objectives or using indirect, complex strategies often leads to suboptimal performance and instability.
