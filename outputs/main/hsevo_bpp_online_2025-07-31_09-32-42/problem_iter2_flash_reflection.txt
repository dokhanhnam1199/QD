**Analysis:**
All provided heuristics implement variations of the "Best Fit" strategy for online bin packing, where the goal is to choose a bin that minimizes the remaining capacity after placing an item. The ranking indicates nuanced differences in their effectiveness.

Comparing (Best) Heuristic 1st vs (Middle Group) Heuristics 2nd-10th:
Heuristic 1st calculates priority as `1.0 / (remaining_waste + epsilon)`. This creates a strong non-linear preference for bins with very little remaining waste; smaller waste leads to disproportionately higher priority. The `epsilon` term ensures numerical stability, especially for perfect fits (waste = 0), yielding a very high, but finite, priority (`1.0 / epsilon`).
Heuristics 2nd-10th (which are functionally identical) calculate priority as `-remaining_waste`. This provides a linear prioritization where perfect fits get a score of `0`, and any waste results in a negative score.
The superior ranking of Heuristic 1st suggests that the non-linear, exponentially stronger preference for very tight fits (including perfect fits) is more effective in practice than a linear prioritization. Both correctly use `-np.inf` for bins that cannot fit the item.

Comparing (Best) Heuristic 1st vs (Worst Group) Heuristics 11th-20th:
Heuristic 1st's `1.0 / (waste + epsilon)` approach provides consistent numerical stability across all valid fits, including perfect ones, where `1/epsilon` acts as the highest possible score. It robustly uses `-np.inf` for non-fitting bins.
Heuristics 11th-20th (which are functionally identical) set priority to `np.inf` for perfect fits and `1.0 / waste` for other valid fits. While `np.inf` clearly signals perfect fits, `1.0 / waste` for `waste > 0` can be numerically unstable if `waste` is an extremely small positive floating-point number (e.g., due to precision errors), potentially leading to `OverflowError` or unreliably large numbers not intended to be "infinite". Furthermore, they initialize priorities for non-fitting bins to `0` instead of `-np.inf`. While `np.argmax` might still function, `0` is an ambiguous signal for "unselectable" compared to `-np.inf`, which unequivocally disqualifies a bin. This makes them less robust and potentially problematic if the calling logic isn't strictly `np.argmax`.

Comparing (Middle Group) Heuristics 2nd-10th vs (Worst Group) Heuristics 11th-20th:
The middle group (H2-10) offers a simple, robust linear "Best Fit" strategy, using `-np.inf` for invalid bins. The worst group (H11-20) attempts a `1/x` type of prioritization (similar in spirit to H1), but introduces potential numerical instability for very small positive `waste` values and uses an ambiguous `0` for non-fitting bins. The ranking implies that the simple, robust linear approach is preferable to a numerically less stable `1/x` approach with ambiguous invalid signals.

Overall: The ranking prioritizes heuristics that give strong preference to tight fits and demonstrate robust handling of edge cases and invalid options.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics benefit from non-linear prioritization of desired outcomes (e.g., tight fits), robust numerical stability (e.g., using epsilon for denominators), and clear, unambiguous signals for invalid choices (e.g., -infinity for non-fitting options). Avoiding potential floating-point overflow/underflow and ambiguous default values is crucial for reliability.
