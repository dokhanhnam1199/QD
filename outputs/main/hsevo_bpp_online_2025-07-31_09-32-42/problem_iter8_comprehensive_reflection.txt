Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Strategic, Multi-objective, Predictive, Robustness.
*   **Advice:** Design multi-stage heuristics blending immediate gains with strategic bin consolidation and fragmentation minimization. Employ adaptive parameters responding to problem state. Prioritize exact fits. Ensure numerical robustness via scale-aware comparisons and integer representations.
*   **Avoid:** Relying purely on single-pass greedy methods. Neglecting explicit fragmentation or balanced bin states as core objectives. Fixed thresholds or simplistic non-adaptive scoring. Superficial epsilon-only numerical fixes.
*   **Explanation:** Better heuristics leverage foresight: multi-objective optimization balancing current placement with future bin utility, and dynamic adaptation to problem complexity, for robust, generalizable performance.
