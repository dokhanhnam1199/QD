Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin, implementing a variation of Best Fit.\n\n    This heuristic aims to select the bin that will have the least remaining capacity\n    after the item is placed, effectively trying to \"fill up\" a bin as much as possible.\n    Bins that cannot accommodate the item receive the lowest possible priority.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n        A higher score indicates a higher priority for placing the item in that bin.\n        Scores are designed such that a perfect fit (remaining capacity = 0) gets the\n        highest possible score (0), while bins that cannot fit the item get -inf.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the remaining space in each bin if the item were placed.\n    # A smaller positive value here means a \"better fit\".\n    potential_remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item\n\n    # Initialize all priorities to negative infinity.

Focus on how problem state changes meaningfully propagate to inform subsequent choices.\n*   **Avoid**: Hardcoding explicit global objectives or dynamic parameter adjustments that react to problem state. Do not rely on specific numerical stability mechanisms (e.g., epsilon, infinity) or predefined \"best fit\" criteria.\n*   **Explanation**: Powerful heuristics often arise from simple, iterative processes where decisions progressively shape the problem state, rather than from pre-engineered complex strategies or numerical safeguards.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
