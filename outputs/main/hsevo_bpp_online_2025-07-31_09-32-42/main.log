    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,
    inspired by Feynman's Principle of Least Action.

    In the context of bin packing, the "action" of placing an item into a bin
    can be conceptualized as the "wasted space" or "entropy generated" within that bin.
    A good strategy would be to choose the bin that minimizes this "action".

    Specifically, the "action" for a given bin is the empty space remaining
    in that bin after the item is placed (i.e., its final remaining capacity).
    We want to select the bin that leads to the smallest possible "action" (least waste).
    Therefore, the priority for a bin is set to be inversely proportional to this
    "action", plus a small epsilon to handle cases of perfect fit (zero remaining space)
    and ensure mathematical stability. This effectively implements a "Best Fit" heuristic
    with a strong non-linear preference for very tight fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:

    #    making it the most desirable outcome.

Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Effective heuristics benefit from non-linear prioritization of desired outcomes (e.g., tight fits), robust numerical stability (e.g., using epsilon for denominators), and clear, unambiguous signals for invalid choices (e.g., -infinity for non-fitting options). Avoiding potential floating-point overflow/underflow and ambiguous default values is crucial for reliability.

Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,
    inspired by Feynman's Principle of Least Action.

    In the context of bin packing, the "action" of placing an item into a bin
    can be conceptualized as the "wasted space" or "entropy generated" within that bin.
    A good strategy would be to choose the bin that minimizes this "action".

    Specifically, the "action" for a given bin is the empty space remaining
    in that bin after the item is placed (i.e., its final remaining capacity).
    We want to select the bin that leads to the smallest possible "action" (least waste).
    Therefore, the priority for a bin is set to be inversely proportional to this
    "action", plus a small epsilon to handle cases of perfect fit (zero remaining space)
    and ensure mathematical stability. This effectively implements a "Best Fit" heuristic
    with a strong non-linear preference for very tight fits.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Bins that cannot fit the item will have a very low (negative infinity) priority,
        ensuring they are not selected unless no other bin is available.
    """

    # This ensures that bins incapable of holding the item are effectively excluded
    # from consideration by having the lowest possible priority.

    # Create a boolean mask to identify which bins have enough remaining capacity
    # to accommodate the current item.
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For the bins that can fit the item, calculate the "action".
    # The "action" is defined as the amount of space that will be left over
    # in the bin after the item is placed. This is the value we aim to minimize.
    action_for_valid_bins = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item

    # Add a small positive constant (epsilon) to the action.
    # This serves two purposes:
    # 1. Prevents division by zero if an item perfectly fits into a bin (action_for_valid_bins = 0).
    # 2. Ensures that a perfect fit results in an extremely high priority score,
    #    making it the most desirable outcome.
    epsilon = 1e-9 # A tiny value, much smaller than any item size

    # Calculate the priority for valid bins.
    # The priority is inversely proportional to the "action".
    # This means smaller actions (less wasted space) yield higher priorities,
    # in line with the Principle of Least Action where paths with minimal action
    # are overwhelmingly favored.

### Analyze & experience
- All provided heuristics implement variations of the "Best Fit" strategy for online bin packing, where the goal is to choose a bin that minimizes the remaining capacity after placing an item. The ranking indicates nuanced differences in their effectiveness.

Comparing (Best) Heuristic 1st vs (Middle Group) Heuristics 2nd-10th:
Heuristic 1st calculates priority as `1.0 / (remaining_waste + epsilon)`. This creates a strong non-linear preference for bins with very little remaining waste; smaller waste leads to disproportionately higher priority. The `epsilon` term ensures numerical stability, especially for perfect fits (waste = 0), yielding a very high, but finite, priority (`1.0 / epsilon`).
Heuristics 2nd-10th (which are functionally identical) calculate priority as `-remaining_waste`. This provides a linear prioritization where perfect fits get a score of `0`, and any waste results in a negative score.
The superior ranking of Heuristic 1st suggests that the non-linear, exponentially stronger preference for very tight fits (including perfect fits) is more effective in practice than a linear prioritization. Both correctly use `-np.inf` for bins that cannot fit the item.

Comparing (Best) Heuristic 1st vs (Worst Group) Heuristics 11th-20th:
Heuristic 1st's `1.0 / (waste + epsilon)` approach provides consistent numerical stability across all valid fits, including perfect ones, where `1/epsilon` acts as the highest possible score. It robustly uses `-np.inf` for non-fitting bins.
Heuristics 11th-20th (which are functionally identical) set priority to `np.inf` for perfect fits and `1.0 / waste` for other valid fits. While `np.inf` clearly signals perfect fits, `1.0 / waste` for `waste > 0` can be numerically unstable if `waste` is an extremely small positive floating-point number (e.g., due to precision errors), potentially leading to `OverflowError` or unreliably large numbers not intended to be "infinite". Furthermore, they initialize priorities for non-fitting bins to `0` instead of `-np.inf`. While `np.argmax` might still function, `0` is an ambiguous signal for "unselectable" compared to `-np.inf`, which unequivocally disqualifies a bin. This makes them less robust and potentially problematic if the calling logic isn't strictly `np.argmax`.

Comparing (Middle Group) Heuristics 2nd-10th vs (Worst Group) Heuristics 11th-20th:
The middle group (H2-10) offers a simple, robust linear "Best Fit" strategy, using `-np.inf` for invalid bins. The worst group (H11-20) attempts a `1/x` type of prioritization (similar in spirit to H1), but introduces potential numerical instability for very small positive `waste` values and uses an ambiguous `0` for non-fitting bins. The ranking implies that the simple, robust linear approach is preferable to a numerically less stable `1/x` approach with ambiguous invalid signals.

Overall: The ranking prioritizes heuristics that give strong preference to tight fits and demonstrate robust handling of edge cases and invalid options.

Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Search, Problem-aware Robustness, Informed Exploration
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to dynamically adjust strategies, learn from search outcomes (e.g., failures), and exploit inherent problem structures for efficient, robust exploration.
*   **Avoid:** Defining 'good' heuristics merely by static numerical stability or clear output signals; instead, focus on how the heuristic's *design* actively achieves adaptiveness and inherent robustness.
*   **Explanation:** This fosters truly intelligent, self-improving heuristics capable of navigating complex landscapes proactively, far beyond merely avoiding computational pitfalls.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin, implementing a variation of Best Fit.

    This heuristic aims to select the bin that will have the least remaining capacity
    after the item is placed, effectively trying to "fill up" a bin as much as possible.
    Bins that cannot accommodate the item receive the lowest possible priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        A higher score indicates a higher priority for placing the item in that bin.
        Scores are designed such that a perfect fit (remaining capacity = 0) gets the
        highest possible score (0), while bins that cannot fit the item get -inf.
    """
    # Calculate the remaining space in each bin if the item were placed.
    # A smaller positive value here means a "better fit".
    potential_remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize all priorities to negative infinity. This ensures that
    # any bin that cannot fit the item will never be chosen.
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)

    # Create a boolean mask for bins where the item can actually fit (remaining space >= 0).
    can_fit_mask = potential_remaining_space >= 0

    # For bins where the item can fit, assign a priority based on the negative
    # of the potential remaining space.
    # By maximizing this value, we are effectively minimizing the potential remaining space.
    # A perfect fit (0 remaining space) will result in a priority of 0 (the highest).
    # A larger remaining space (e.g., 0.5) will result in a lower priority (-0.5).
    priorities[can_fit_mask] = -potential_remaining_space[can_fit_mask]

    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Search, Problem-aware Robustness, Informed Exploration
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to dynamically adjust strategies, learn from search outcomes (e.g., failures), and exploit inherent problem structures for efficient, robust exploration.
*   **Avoid:** Defining 'good' heuristics merely by static numerical stability or clear output signals; instead, focus on how the heuristic's *design* actively achieves adaptiveness and inherent robustness.
*   **Explanation:** This fosters truly intelligent, self-improving heuristics capable of navigating complex landscapes proactively, far beyond merely avoiding computational pitfalls.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    """Robust Best Fit heuristic that favors least remaining capacity.

    This function implements a highly effective Best Fit strategy by prioritizing bins
    that result in the smallest remaining capacity after placing the item. This simple,
    local rule naturally encourages filling bins and achieves consolidation without
    complex parameters or conflicting objectives, aligning with emergent behavior principles.

    Args:
        item (float): The size of the item to be placed.
        bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array of the remaining capacities of the bins.
        initial_unfit_priority (float, optional): The priority assigned to bins where the item
            cannot fit. Defaults to -np.inf to ensure these bins are never selected.
        fit_threshold (float, optional): The minimum allowed remaining capacity for an item
            to be considered 'fitting'. If potential_remaining_space is less than this,
            the item is considered not to fit. Defaults to 0.0.
        remaining_space_priority_factor (float, optional): A factor by which the potential
            remaining space is multiplied to determine the priority. A negative value
            (e.g., -1.0 for Best Fit) prioritizes smaller remaining space, while a
            positive value (e.g., 1.0 for Worst Fit) prioritizes larger remaining space.
            Defaults to -1.0.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array of priority scores for each bin. Higher scores indicate
                    higher preference.
    """
    # Calculate the remaining space in each bin if the item were placed.
    # A smaller positive value here means a "better fit".
    potential_remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize all priorities to a specified value for bins that cannot fit.
    # This ensures that any bin that cannot fit the item will never be chosen.
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, initial_unfit_priority, dtype=float)

    # Create a boolean mask for bins where the item can actually fit
    # (remaining space is greater than or equal to the fit_threshold).
    can_fit_mask = potential_remaining_space >= fit_threshold

    # For bins where the item can fit, assign a priority based on the potential
    # remaining space, weighted by the specified factor.
    # By maximizing this value (when factor is negative), we effectively minimize
    # the potential remaining space. A perfect fit (0 remaining space) naturally
    # results in a priority of 0 (the highest possible when factor is -1),
    # embodying the "perfect fit" priority without explicit, hardcoded scores.
