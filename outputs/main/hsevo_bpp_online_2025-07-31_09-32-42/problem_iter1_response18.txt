    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,
    implementing a Best Fit-like heuristic inspired by precise fitting.

    This function prioritizes bins that, after accommodating the item, would have
    the smallest positive remaining capacity. This aims to 'snugly' fit items
    and leave minimal waste in chosen bins, thereby maximizing the chance for
    future items to fit elsewhere or for the current bin to be efficiently filled.
    Bins that cannot accommodate the item are given a very low priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Higher scores indicate higher priority.

    # Initialize priority scores.
    # For bins that can fit the item (potential_remaining_after_fit >= 0),
    # we want to maximize the priority for smaller positive remaining capacities.
    # Taking the negative of potential_remaining_after_fit achieves this:
    #   - If remaining is 0 (perfect fit), priority is 0 (the highest score for a valid placement).
    #   - If remaining is 1, priority is -1.
    #   - If remaining is 5, priority is -5.
    # This means 0 > -1 > -5, correctly prioritizing the snuggest fit among valid bins.

    # case the bin packing logic would typically create a new bin.
