{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics benefit from non-linear prioritization of desired outcomes (e.g., tight fits), robust numerical stability (e.g., using epsilon for denominators), and clear, unambiguous signals for invalid choices (e.g., -infinity for non-fitting options). Avoiding potential floating-point overflow/underflow and ambiguous default values is crucial for reliability.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
