Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection':

*   **Keywords**: Emergent Behavior, Local Rules, State Evolution, Information Flow.
*   **Advice**: Design heuristics with minimal, local decision rules where desired global outcomes emerge from their aggregate application. Focus on how problem state changes meaningfully propagate to inform subsequent choices.
*   **Avoid**: Hardcoding explicit global objectives or dynamic parameter adjustments that react to problem state. Do not rely on specific numerical stability mechanisms (e.g., epsilon, infinity) or predefined "best fit" criteria.
*   **Explanation**: Powerful heuristics often arise from simple, iterative processes where decisions progressively shape the problem state, rather than from pre-engineered complex strategies or numerical safeguards.
