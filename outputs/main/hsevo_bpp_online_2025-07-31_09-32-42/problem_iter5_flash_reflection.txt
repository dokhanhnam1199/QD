**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd) vs (4th) vs (9th), we see they are virtually identical implementations of Best Fit with an inverse-waste priority. Their top ranking suggests this simple, non-linear preference for tight fits, using `np.finfo(float).eps` for numerical stability, is highly effective.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), and (4th) vs (3rd), 3rd is ranked worse despite similar core logic. The key differences are that 3rd uses a hardcoded `epsilon` value as a function argument and includes unused imports (`random`, `math`, `scipy`, `torch`). This suggests that using `np.finfo(float).eps` for maximum numerical robustness and keeping imports clean contributes to better heuristic design and possibly performance.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), and also the general cluster of 1st,2nd,4th,9th (simple inverse Best Fit) against 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th (fragmentation aversion/dead space penalty), the simpler inverse Best Fit consistently ranks higher. This indicates that explicitly trying to avoid "fragmentation" or "dead space" with additional penalty logic, even if well-intentioned, might introduce complexity that hinders overall performance compared to directly prioritizing the smallest waste. The non-linear `1/(waste+epsilon)` already inherently penalizes larger waste, including small "awkward" ones, by giving them disproportionately lower scores.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th), 7th is a more complex version of fragmentation aversion with multiple thresholds and bonuses/penalties. It's ranked worse than 6th (which is effectively a basic Best Fit with issues). This reinforces that increased algorithmic complexity with multiple tunable parameters can be detrimental.

Comparing (8th) vs (9th), 9th (simple inverse Best Fit) is better than 8th (Best Fit with dead space penalty). This further supports the strength of the `1/(waste+epsilon)` approach over explicit penalty schemes.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), 11th (Adaptive Best Fit with explicit high score for perfect fits) is better than 10th (dead space penalty). This indicates that making perfect fits unequivocally dominant via a very large, fixed score (like `1e12`) can be an effective refinement, though it's still ranked below the top simple inverse Best Fit.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th), and analyzing the entire bottom cluster (15th-20th) of "Adaptive Median Fit" against the higher-ranked heuristics, the "Adaptive Median Fit" consistently performs the worst. This heuristic tries to select a bin whose remaining capacity is closest to the *median* of all possible remaining capacities, aiming for a "balanced" bin state. This strong negative result suggests that aiming for uniformity or balancing remaining bin capacities is counterproductive for bin packing, which typically benefits from aggressive waste minimization and closing bins efficiently, even if it leads to some highly filled and some empty bins.

Overall: The best heuristics are robust Best Fit variants with a strong, non-linear preference for tight fits (implicit or explicit) and good numerical stability. Added complexity like fragmentation aversion or "balancing" strategies tend to degrade performance.

**Experience:**
For bin packing heuristics, prioritize simple, greedy "Best Fit" with robust non-linear scoring (e.g., `1/(waste+epsilon)`). This inherently rewards tight fits. Avoid over-complicating with explicit fragmentation penalties or striving for "balanced" bin states, as these often lead to suboptimal solutions by deviating from direct waste minimization. Numerical stability (e.g., `np.finfo(float).eps`) is key.
