*   **Keywords**: Predictive State, Adaptive Logic, Global Utility, Hybrid Search.
*   **Advice**: Design scoring that anticipates future bin configurations. Integrate adaptive strategies for dynamic bin management. Explore controlled look-ahead or multi-objective trade-offs for superior global utility.
*   **Avoid**: Over-emphasizing only immediate greedy fits. Merely stating implementation robustness (e.g., epsilon) or error handling as core design principles.
*   **Explanation**: Advancing heuristics requires foresight into bin states and dynamic adaptation, moving beyond local optimality. Focus on conceptual logic, not just robust implementation.
