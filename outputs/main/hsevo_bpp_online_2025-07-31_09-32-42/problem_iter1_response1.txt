    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    As I, Albert Einstein, observe the universe, it strives for efficiency,
    minimizing wasted space and maximizing the utility of available 'regions'
    in the continuum. In this context of bin packing, we seek to find the
    'tightest' possible fit for an item, as this reduces fragmentation and
    optimizes the overall 'density' of our packed system.

    A bin that precisely accommodates an item is the most elegant solution,
    leaving no superfluous 'void'. Bins that are too large, while capable
    of holding the item, introduce unnecessary 'empty space' that might
    be better utilized by a different configuration.

    Therefore, our priority score must reflect this principle:

    1.  Bins that cannot accommodate the item are, unequivocally, invalid.
        Their 'priority' is non-existent, akin to an item attempting to
        occupy space already claimed by another particle, resulting in an
        infinite repulsion. We assign them the lowest possible score.

    2.  For bins where the item can fit, we favor those that leave the least
        remaining capacity. This is the 'best fit' strategy, designed to
        maximize the 'fullness' of each bin, ensuring our collection of bins
        achieves the highest possible 'packing density'.

    The score is calculated such that a bin leaving zero remaining capacity
    (a perfect fit) receives the highest score. Bins leaving more capacity
    will receive progressively lower scores, reflecting their less 'optimal'
    utilization of space.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Initialize scores. Bins that cannot fit the item are assigned a value
    # akin to an 'infinite barrier' or 'repulsive force', meaning they are invalid.
    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

    # Identify the 'regions' (bins) where the item's 'mass' can be accommodated.
    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For valid bins, we calculate a score based on the 'tightness' of the fit.
    # The ideal scenario is when 'item' perfectly fills 'bins_remain_cap'.
    # This means (bins_remain_cap - item) should be minimized for positive values.
    # To prioritize minimization of positive difference, we can maximize its negative:
    # score = - (bins_remain_cap - item)
    # This is equivalent to: score = item - bins_remain_cap
    # A perfect fit (item == bins_remain_cap) yields a score of 0, the highest possible for a valid bin.
    # A bin with 1.0 remaining capacity for item 0.5 yields score 0.5 - 1.0 = -0.5.
    # A bin with 0.6 remaining capacity for item 0.5 yields score 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1.
    # A bin with 0.5 remaining capacity for item 0.5 yields score 0.5 - 0.5 = 0.0.
    # This ensures that bins offering the 'tightest' fit receive the highest priority.
    scores[can_fit_mask] = item - bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]
