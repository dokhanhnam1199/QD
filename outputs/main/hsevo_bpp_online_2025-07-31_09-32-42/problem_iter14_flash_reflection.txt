**Analysis:**
Comparing the provided heuristics, it's evident that strategies focusing on maximizing bin utilization and minimizing wasted space perform significantly better. The list contains several identical heuristics, which will be noted in the comparisons.

*   **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** The 1st heuristic, ranked best, employs a robust Best Fit core and a strong, fixed `PERFECT_FIT_BONUS` (1000.0). In contrast, the 2nd heuristic introduces a subtle, proportional consolidation bonus and a lower `EXACT_FIT_BONUS` (100.0). The superior performance of 1st suggests that a very high, overriding bonus for exact fits is more critical than a nuanced, proportional consolidation strategy. Simplicity and dominance of the perfect fit rule likely contribute to its effectiveness.

*   **Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd):** The 2nd heuristic uses a linear Best Fit score, while the 3rd uses an inverse Best Fit score (`1.0 / (potential_remaining_space + EPSILON)`) and an inverse fullness consolidation bonus. The 3rd also uses an even higher `PERFECT_FIT_SCORE` (1e30). While the higher perfect fit score in 3rd is beneficial, the inverse scoring for Best Fit and consolidation can make the heuristic highly sensitive to small numerical differences, potentially leading to instability or less predictable behavior compared to the more stable linear approach in 2nd. The ranking suggests that the linear Best Fit combined with a strong exact fit bonus (as in 2nd) is more effective than the inverse-based scaling of 3rd, despite 3rd's even higher perfect fit constant.
    *   *Note:* Heuristics 6th and 8th are identical to 3rd.

*   **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** The 3rd heuristic uses inverse scoring for its Best Fit and consolidation components. The 4th heuristic reverts to a linear Best Fit score (`-potential_remaining_space`) combined with a dominant exact fit bonus and a *fixed additive* `PARTIALLY_FILLED_BIN_BONUS`. The 4th's superior ranking over 3rd indicates that a simpler, fixed consolidation bonus is more effective or robust than a complex inverse-proportional one. It reinforces the idea that linear Best Fit scoring is preferable.
    *   *Note:* Heuristic 7th is identical to 4th.

*   **Comparing (4th) vs (5th):** The 4th heuristic employs a consolidation bonus to fill partially used bins, while the 5th heuristic introduces a *penalty* for creating "fragmented" gaps. The better performance of 4th suggests that a positive incentive for consolidation (filling existing bins) is generally more effective or easier to tune than a negative incentive for avoiding specific types of gaps. Both aim to improve space utilization but consolidation seems to yield better overall results in this ranking.

*   **Comparing (5th) vs (9th):** The 5th heuristic is a refined Best Fit variant. The 9th heuristic introduces a "relative utilization" approach (`item / bins_remain_cap`), prioritizing bins where the item consumes a larger *proportion* of the remaining capacity. The significant drop in rank shows that classic Best Fit (minimizing absolute remaining space) is vastly superior to relative utilization for general bin packing, as the latter might lead to many partially filled bins if not carefully balanced.

*   **Comparing (9th) vs (10th):** The 9th heuristic (relative utilization) is outperformed by the 10th, which is a pure Best Fit implementation (`-potential_remaining_space`). This clearly demonstrates that Best Fit, by directly aiming to minimize wasted space within a bin, is a stronger foundational heuristic for reducing the total number of bins compared to a relative fit approach.

*   **Comparing (10th) vs (11th):** The 10th heuristic (Pure Best Fit) ranks much higher than the 11th (Worst Fit based on potential remaining space). This is a well-known result in bin packing: Best Fit generally minimizes the number of bins by packing them tightly, while Worst Fit aims to distribute items, often leading to more open bins and higher bin counts.

*   **Comparing (11th) vs (12th):** Both are Worst Fit variants. The 11th prioritizes bins that will have the *most remaining space after placement*. The 12th prioritizes bins that *currently have the most remaining capacity*. The marginally better ranking of 11th suggests that considering the *post-placement* state for a Worst Fit strategy is slightly more effective than solely relying on the pre-placement state.
    *   *Note:* Heuristics 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 20th are identical to 12th. Heuristics 16th and 18th are identical to 11th.

**Overall:**
The best heuristics are always variants of Best Fit. The most critical factor for performance in bin packing is the overwhelming priority given to exact or near-exact fits. Additional strategic bonuses for consolidating items into existing, partially-filled bins can provide a further edge, but simpler, fixed additive bonuses often perform more robustly than complex proportional or inverse weighting schemes. Worst Fit strategies consistently perform poorly for minimizing bin count.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics:
1.  **Prioritize Perfect Fits:** Give an overwhelming, absolute bonus to exact fits.
2.  **Best Fit Core:** Implement Best Fit by minimizing potential remaining capacity.
3.  **Refine with Simple Additions:** Use subtle, fixed bonuses for consolidation; avoid over-complicating with proportional/inverse scaling or fragmentation penalties unless specifically justified.
4.  **Robustness:** Handle floating-point comparisons carefully with epsilon.
5.  **Avoid Worst Fit:** Unless specifically aiming for load balancing, Worst Fit is detrimental for bin count minimization.
