Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Search, Problem-aware Robustness, Informed Exploration
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to dynamically adjust strategies, learn from search outcomes (e.g., failures), and exploit inherent problem structures for efficient, robust exploration.
*   **Avoid:** Defining 'good' heuristics merely by static numerical stability or clear output signals; instead, focus on how the heuristic's *design* actively achieves adaptiveness and inherent robustness.
*   **Explanation:** This fosters truly intelligent, self-improving heuristics capable of navigating complex landscapes proactively, far beyond merely avoiding computational pitfalls.
