Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics, specifically avoiding pitfalls and focusing on improvements. Here's a refined perspective:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Heuristics, State-Aware Prioritization, Feasibility Enforcement, Dynamic Adjustment.

*   **Advice:** Implement a feedback loop where the heuristic's parameters (like the Gaussian distribution's variance) are dynamically adjusted based on the algorithm's performance and state. Prioritize feasibility checks aggressively during state transitions.

*   **Avoid:** Rigid, pre-defined Gaussian parameters. Focus on adaptive adjustments informed by the current bin packing state. Avoid simple "band-aid" fixes for invalid states; design the heuristic to prevent them proactively.

*   **Explanation:** A static Gaussian approach lacks adaptability. By making the heuristic parameters state-aware, the algorithm can learn and improve its packing efficiency. Early feasibility enforcement prevents downstream problems.
