**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of Gaussian fit, capacity ratio, and adaptive exploration, while the worst only uses the negative log of the item/bin ratio. (2nd) is much simpler than (1st), lacking the iteration-based exploration and almost-full bin bonus. The core difference lies in the sophistication of the priority calculation.
Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), there is no difference. Comparing (2nd) vs (7th), we see that (7th) adds the near-full bin reward to Gaussian fit and capacity ratio, while (2nd) is using just the Gaussian fit and capacity ratio. Comparing (16th) vs (20th), there is no difference.
Overall: The best heuristics employ a multi-faceted approach, combining Gaussian distributions centered on the item size with capacity ratios and adaptive elements (exploration factor, almost full bin bonus, bin utilization). Simpler approaches relying solely on capacity ratios tend to perform worse. Adaptive exploration and bonuses for almost-full bins appear to significantly improve performance. Gaussian distribution is an important component to have.

**Experience:**
Sophisticated heuristics should combine multiple factors, like Gaussian fits for ideal capacity, capacity ratios, and adaptive exploration or rewards. Consider the state of the bins (e.g., utilization) and iterate to adjust parameters for better performance.
