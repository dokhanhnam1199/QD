Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines Gaussian fit and capacity ratio for bin selection.\"\"\"\n\n    mu = item\n    sigma = item / 3.0\n    gaussian = np.exp(-((bins_remain_cap - mu) ** 2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n\n    # Combine Gaussian with capacity ratio.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) are similar to (1st) and (20th) correspondingly. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical; (3rd) vs (4th) are identical... (8th) vs (9th) - the 9th version introduces tunable parameters (`sigma_factor`, `perturbation_strength`) for the Gaussian and perturbation, and imports unnecessary libraries. Comparing (10th) vs (12th), we see that the 10th introduces adaptive parameters based on bin utilization and iteration number to control exploration/exploitation. It also introduces an \"almost full\" bonus. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors (Gaussian fit, capacity ratio, bin utilization, iteration number) and adaptive mechanisms, while simpler heuristics solely rely on the item-to-capacity ratio. Higher ranked heuristics also prioritize not picking impossible bins.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive heuristics, parameter tuning, domain knowledge, Gaussian distributions, state-based perturbation, constraint handling.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust parameters based on the current bin packing state. Leverage domain-specific insights (e.g., rewarding near-full bins).\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, untuned parameters that hinder performance; ignoring invalid states.\n\n*   **Explanation:** By focusing on adaptive strategies and incorporating domain-specific rules while maintaining solution validity, heuristics become more robust and efficient. Rigorous parameter tuning is essential.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
