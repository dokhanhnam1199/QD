{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nMore complex heuristics with adaptive parameters and consideration of multiple factors tend to perform better in bin packing. Tunable parameters can be beneficial, but careful selection and tuning are crucial. Utilizing domain knowledge (e.g., \"almost full\" bonus) can further enhance performance.\nEmploy Gaussian-like distributions centered around ideal values when defining heuristic priorities for bin packing. Incorporate perturbations based on the current state to encourage desired actions, like filling bins completely. Explicitly handle invalid scenarios (e.g., negative remaining capacity) to prevent unexpected behavior.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
