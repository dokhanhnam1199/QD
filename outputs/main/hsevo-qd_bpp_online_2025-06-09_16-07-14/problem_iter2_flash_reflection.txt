**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the Gaussian heuristic uses a more sophisticated approach to prioritize bins based on how well the item size fits the remaining capacity, whereas the logarithmic heuristic simply uses the negative log of the ratio between item size and remaining capacity. This Gaussian approach also incorporates a small perturbation to encourage filling bins more completely, which the logarithmic heuristic lacks.
Comparing (2nd) vs (11th), we see the Gaussian heuristic employs a Gaussian distribution centered around the item size, with a standard deviation related to the item size to prioritize bins whose remaining capacity is close to the item size. It includes a perturbation factor based on remaining capacity to encourage filling bins more. The logarithmic heuristic directly calculates the ratio of item size to remaining capacity, takes the natural logarithm, and assigns the negative of this value as the priority.
All the top 10 heuristics have the same code and are superior to the rest. All the bottom 10 heuristics have the same code. Overall: The Gaussian distribution with perturbation appears to offer a more nuanced approach to bin packing than the simple logarithmic ratio, resulting in better performance. The logarithmic ratio is also missing logic to avoid negative remaining capacity.

**Experience:**
Employ Gaussian-like distributions centered around ideal values when defining heuristic priorities for bin packing. Incorporate perturbations based on the current state to encourage desired actions, like filling bins completely. Explicitly handle invalid scenarios (e.g., negative remaining capacity) to prevent unexpected behavior.
