**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a Gaussian distribution combined with a capacity ratio, and explicitly avoids impossible bins, while the worst only considers the log of the ratio between item size and remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) are similar to (1st) and (20th) correspondingly. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical; (3rd) vs (4th) are identical... (8th) vs (9th) - the 9th version introduces tunable parameters (`sigma_factor`, `perturbation_strength`) for the Gaussian and perturbation, and imports unnecessary libraries. Comparing (10th) vs (12th), we see that the 10th introduces adaptive parameters based on bin utilization and iteration number to control exploration/exploitation. It also introduces an "almost full" bonus. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors (Gaussian fit, capacity ratio, bin utilization, iteration number) and adaptive mechanisms, while simpler heuristics solely rely on the item-to-capacity ratio. Higher ranked heuristics also prioritize not picking impossible bins.

**Experience:**
More complex heuristics with adaptive parameters and consideration of multiple factors tend to perform better in bin packing. Tunable parameters can be beneficial, but careful selection and tuning are crucial. Utilizing domain knowledge (e.g., "almost full" bonus) can further enhance performance.
