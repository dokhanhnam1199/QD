Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for designing bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive heuristics, parameter tuning, domain knowledge, Gaussian distributions, state-based perturbation, constraint handling.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust parameters based on the current bin packing state. Leverage domain-specific insights (e.g., rewarding near-full bins).

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, untuned parameters that hinder performance; ignoring invalid states.

*   **Explanation:** By focusing on adaptive strategies and incorporating domain-specific rules while maintaining solution validity, heuristics become more robust and efficient. Rigorous parameter tuning is essential.
