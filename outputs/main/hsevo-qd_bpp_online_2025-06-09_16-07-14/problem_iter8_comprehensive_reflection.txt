Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding vague statements. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Actionable Insights, Data-Driven Adaptation, Constraint Awareness, Performance Metrics.

*   **Advice:** Instead of just noting that parameters *can* be tuned, identify *how* to tune them. Use performance metrics to guide parameter adaptation based on real-time bin state. Quantify "almost full" with specific capacity thresholds for bonuses.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements like "consider multiple factors" or "complex heuristics perform better." This lacks specific guidance.

*   **Explanation:** Actionable self-reflection means deriving concrete steps. Focus on quantifying domain knowledge and using performance data to drive adaptive heuristic adjustments, all while respecting constraints.
