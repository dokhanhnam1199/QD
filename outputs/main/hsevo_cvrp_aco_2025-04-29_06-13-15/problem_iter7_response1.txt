    """
    Heuristics for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.

    This version incorporates:
    1. Distance: Edges with shorter distances are preferred.
    2. Demand Feasibility: Penalizes edges that would immediately violate capacity constraints.
    3. Depot Proximity: Prioritizes returning to the depot from nodes that are far from other customers and have high demand.
    4. Savings Heuristic Integration: Incorporates the savings heuristic to encourage merging routes.
    5. Clustering Encouragement: Encourages connections within spatial clusters.
    6. Sparsification: Sets unpromising edges to zero to focus the search, adaptively.
    7. Adaptive Weighting: Dynamically adjusts weights based on problem characteristics.
    8. Demand Density: Considers demand density around each node.
    9. Angle to Depot: Prioritizes connections that reduce the angle formed by (node i - depot - node j) to encourage direct routes

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (shape: n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (shape: n). The demand of depot is demands[0].
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.
        demand_violation_penalty (float): Penalty for edges violating capacity when one node is the depot. Default is 0.1.
        high_demand_violation_penalty (float): Penalty for edges violating capacity for other nodes. Default is 0.05.
        neighborhood_size (int): Number of neighbors to consider for demand density. Default is 5.
        alpha (float): Weight for distance heuristic. Default is 0.3.
        beta (float): Weight for depot proximity heuristic. Default is 0.15.
        gamma (float): Weight for savings heuristic. Default is 0.20.
        delta (float): Weight for clustering heuristic. Default is 0.15.
        eta (float): Weight for demand density heuristic. Default is 0.1.
        phi (float): Weight for angle heuristic. Default is 0.1.
        sparsity_percentile (float): Percentile for sparsification threshold. Default is 40.0.
        k_nearest (int): Number of nearest neighbors to consider regardless of sparsification threshold. Default is 12.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n x n).
