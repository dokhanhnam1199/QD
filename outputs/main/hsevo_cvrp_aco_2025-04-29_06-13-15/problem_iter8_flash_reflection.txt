**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates more diverse factors, including distance, demand feasibility, depot proximity, gravitational attraction, savings heuristic, clustering coefficient, and adaptive weighting, while the worst only considers distance, demand, angle, and depot proximity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows similar trend. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best heuristic uses adaptive weighting that adjusts based on problem characteristics, such as capacity tightness, while the second best uses fixed weights based on demand ratio. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a trend where later heuristics incorporate angle-based clustering and normalize heuristic components, features absent in the earlier ones. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they share same logic. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate a wider range of problem-specific information, use adaptive weighting schemes, and normalize their heuristic components. Sparsification is a common feature, but its implementation and thresholding vary.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider a diverse set of factors relevant to the problem. Implement adaptive weighting schemes that adjust based on problem characteristics to dynamically prioritize factors. Normalization of heuristic components can improve stability and performance. Employ sparsification to focus the search, but carefully tune the threshold.
