{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nCombining multiple relevant heuristics with adaptive weighting and sparsification yields better results for CVRP. Consider factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, and savings. Adaptive weights allow adjusting the influence of each factor based on problem characteristics. Sparsification focuses the search.\n```\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating diverse factors beyond basic distance and demand. Spatial relationships, such as clustering and gravitational attraction, can significantly improve performance. Normalizing the heuristic output and carefully tuning the weights of different factors are also critical for stability and adaptability.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
