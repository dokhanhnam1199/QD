**Analysis:**

*   **(1st) vs (2nd):** These heuristics are identical.
*   **(1st/2nd) vs (3rd):** These heuristics are identical.
*   **(1st/2nd/3rd) vs (4th):** The 4th heuristic introduces several key refinements:
    *   **Distance:** Uses inverse square distance to emphasize shorter edges more.
    *   **Demand Feasibility:** Implements stricter penalties for capacity violations and simulates route capacity.
    *   **Depot Proximity:** Applies depot preference contextually to isolated nodes.
    *   **Savings:** Aggressively prioritizes high-saving merges.
    *   **Node Similarity:** Encourages connections based on demand/distance profiles.
    *   **Adaptive Weighting:** Adjusts weights dynamically based on network connectivity.
    *   **Sparsification:** Removes edges using percentile thresholding and the triangle inequality.
*   **(4th) vs (5th):** Heuristic 5 introduces angle-based clustering and normalizes individual heuristic components before combining them. Heuristic 4 simulates routing to estimate the remaining capacity and implements triangle inequality during sparsification.
*   **(5th) vs (6th):** The heuristics are identical.
*   **(5th/6th) vs (7th):** Heuristic 7 introduces demand density, adaptively weights based on problem size, and normalizes individual heuristics components before combining them.
*   **(7th) vs (8th):** The 8th heuristic focuses on normalizing all heuristic components, encouraging clustering based on spatial proximity, and adaptively weighting based on problem size and characteristics.
*   **(8th) vs (9th):** Heuristic 9 simplifies by removing the angle cost and clustering components.
*   **(9th) vs (10th):** The heuristics are identical.
*   **(9th/10th) vs (11th):** The 11th heuristic normalizes the heuristic components before combining them and reintroduces a clustering coefficient approximation.
*   **(11th) vs (12th):** The heuristics are identical.
*   **(11th/12th) vs (13th):** Heuristic 13 focuses on angles from the depot, demand-distance interaction, node diversity weighting, and adjusts sparsification criteria.
*   **(13th) vs (14th):** Heuristic 14 normalizes all components.
*   **(14th) vs (15th):** The 15th heuristic explicitly includes and normalizes an "angle cost" heuristic, prioritizing nodes with smaller angles from the depot.
*   **(15th) vs (16th):** The heuristics are identical.
*   **(16th) vs (17th):** The heuristics are identical.
*   **(16th/17th) vs (18th):** The 18th heuristic adds a node centrality measure and normalizes the clustering heuristic and centrality heuristic, and also adapts the k value used in the clustering.
*   **(18th) vs (19th):** The heuristics are identical.
*   **(19th) vs (20th):** The heuristics are identical.

Overall: The best heuristics combine several factors: Distance, Demand, Savings, Depot Proximity, Clustering, Angle Cost, Centrality, Adaptive Weighting, Sparsification and Normalization to ensure components are on the same scale. Demand feasibility and distance are the most significant.

**Experience:**
Prioritize problem-specific knowledge: The best heuristics include many factors (distance, demand, savings) and utilize adaptive weights based on instance characteristics (capacity ratio, problem size, node diversity). Normalizing each component before combining them is also important.
