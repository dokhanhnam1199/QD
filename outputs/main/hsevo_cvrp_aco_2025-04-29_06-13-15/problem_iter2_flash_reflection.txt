**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates a gravitational attraction component, while the worst uses a simpler angle factor. Also, the best normalizes the combined heuristics to between 0 and 1, potentially improving stability. The worst uses fixed weights, potentially limiting adaptability.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), we see that "Heuristics 2nd" and "Heuristics 19th" exhibit noticeable distinctions. "Heuristics 2nd" employs gravitational attraction, demand feasibility, and depot proximity while "Heuristics 19th" focuses on angle relative to the depot.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), there are no difference so both are the same.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that "Heuristics 3rd" calculates an angle between edges (i->j) and (j-> depot) as a proxy for a smooth route, also including additional penalty for high demand customers. "Heuristics 4th" measures the angle each node creates to the depot and combine angle and demand penalty.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), "Heuristics 19th" calculates angle between nodes relative to the depot, encouraging edges connecting nodes with similar angles. "Heuristics 20th" calculates angle between the vectors from node i to node j and from node 0 (depot) to node j, preferring edges that don't make sharp turns.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more sophisticated factors like gravitational attraction and spatial distribution, while also normalizing the output. Simpler approaches relying solely on distance, demand, and basic angle calculations tend to perform worse. The weighting of different factors and handling of edge cases (e.g., division by zero) also seem to play a crucial role. Depot proximity is a frequently used concept that appears in many of the better heuristics.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider incorporating diverse factors beyond basic distance and demand. Spatial relationships, such as clustering and gravitational attraction, can significantly improve performance. Normalizing the heuristic output and carefully tuning the weights of different factors are also critical for stability and adaptability.
