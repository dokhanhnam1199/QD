- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection to guide heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights:

*   **Keywords:** Factor diversity, adaptive weighting, normalization, spatial relationships, sparsification, problem characteristics.

*   **Advice:** Explore clustering techniques, gravitational attraction principles, and rigorous normalization strategies within your heuristics. Adapt weights based on real-time problem characteristics, not just initial assumptions.

*   **Avoid:** Solely relying on distance/demand, static weighting schemes, ignoring spatial context, premature convergence.

*   **Explanation:** Broadening the factor base and adapting to problem nuances are crucial for robust and high-performing heuristics. Normalization stabilizes weighting.
