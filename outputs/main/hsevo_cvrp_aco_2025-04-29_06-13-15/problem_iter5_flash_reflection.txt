**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), there's no difference.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), there's no difference.
Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the former utilizes multiple heuristics (distance, demand feasibility, depot proximity, gravitational attraction, savings, sparsification) with adaptive weights, while the latter combines distance, demand, angle to depot, and angle between nodes with fixed weights and capacity penalty.
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), there's no difference.
Comparing (5th) vs (7th), there's no difference.
Comparing (1st) vs (8th), (1st) uses sparsification based on k-nearest neighbors and a dynamic threshold, (8th) uses simpler sparsification based on a mean threshold. (1st) combines with fixed weights while (8th) uses adaptive weighting.
Comparing (1st) vs (9th), (1st) is more complex, (9th) appears simpler.
Comparing (9th) vs (10th), there's no difference.
Comparing (9th) vs (11th), there's no difference.
Comparing (1st) vs (12th), (1st) uses more diverse heuristics like gravitational attraction and savings, along with k-NN sparsification, while (12th) focuses on distance, demand, spatial clustering and depot attraction. Adaptive scaling is present in both.
Comparing (12th) vs (13th), there's no difference.
Comparing (12th) vs (14th), there's no difference.
Comparing (1st) vs (15th), (1st) uses more heuristics and better sparsification.
Comparing (15th) vs (16th), there's no difference.
Comparing (1st) vs (17th), (1st) has more diverse heuristics and better sparsification. (17th) uses unusual demand scaling with distance.
Comparing (1st) vs (18th), (1st) has more diverse heuristics and better sparsification.
Comparing (1st) vs (19th), (1st) is more complex and includes sparsification while (19th) lacks it.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), there's no difference.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), (19th) and (20th) are identical.

Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors (distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, savings) using adaptive weights. Sparsification using k-NN or dynamic thresholds is preferred. Simpler heuristics focusing on fewer factors or fixed weights tend to perform worse.

**Experience:**
Combining multiple relevant heuristics with adaptive weighting and sparsification yields better results for CVRP. Consider factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, and savings. Adaptive weights allow adjusting the influence of each factor based on problem characteristics. Sparsification focuses the search.
