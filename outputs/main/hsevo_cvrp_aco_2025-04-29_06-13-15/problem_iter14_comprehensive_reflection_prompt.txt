{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize problem-specific knowledge: The best heuristics include many factors (distance, demand, savings) and utilize adaptive weights based on instance characteristics (capacity ratio, problem size, node diversity). Normalizing each component before combining them is also important.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating diverse factors beyond basic distance and demand. Spatial relationships, such as clustering and gravitational attraction, can significantly improve performance. Normalizing the heuristic output and carefully tuning the weights of different factors are also critical for stability and adaptability.\n\nCombining multiple relevant heuristics with adaptive weighting and sparsification yields better results for CVRP. Consider factors like distance, demand, depot proximity, angles, and savings. Adaptive weights allow adjusting the influence of each factor based on problem characteristics. Sparsification focuses the search.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider incorporating diverse factors that influence solution quality, normalizing individual heuristic components, and using adaptive weighting schemes based on multiple problem characteristics to improve performance and robustness. Sparsification is crucial and should be adaptive to the problem instance.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider a diverse set of factors relevant to the problem. Implement adaptive weighting schemes that adjust based on problem characteristics to dynamically prioritize factors. Normalization of heuristic components can improve stability and performance. Employ sparsification to focus the search, but carefully tune the threshold.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
