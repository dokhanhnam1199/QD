- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more actionable and insightful for designing better heuristics.

Here's a revised approach, focusing on avoiding generic advice and promoting concrete steps:

*   **Keywords:** Contextualization, Granularity, Mechanism, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Frame heuristics within problem-specific contexts. Deconstruct heuristics into finer-grained components. Define specific adaptation mechanisms, not just "adaptive weighting." Rigorously validate the impact of each component and adaptation strategy.
*   **Avoid:** General statements about "diverse factors," "adaptive weighting," or "sparsification" without concrete implementation details.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond generic principles. Provide precise mechanisms by which normalization, weighting, and sparsification are achieved based on context. Demonstrate via experiments impact of these components on performance.
