- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I will help you redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a refined reflection framework:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive Weighting, Normalization, Sparsification, Problem Characteristics, Spatial Relationships.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics incorporating diverse factors beyond basic features, especially spatial relationships. Implement adaptive weighting schemes dynamically adjusted by problem characteristics. Normalize heuristic outputs.
*   **Avoid:** Static weights, neglecting problem-specific features, unnormalized components, and fixed sparsification thresholds.
*   **Explanation:** Combine diverse, normalized factors using problem-aware adaptive weights. Use sparsification judiciously.
