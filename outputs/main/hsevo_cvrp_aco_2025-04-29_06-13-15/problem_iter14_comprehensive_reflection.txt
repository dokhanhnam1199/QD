- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a redefinition of "Current Self-Reflection" optimized for designing better heuristics, while avoiding the pitfalls of the "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Problem-specific, Adaptive, Normalization, Sparsification, Diverse Factors, Robustness, Solution Quality Influence, Spatial relationships, Clustering, Gravitational attraction.

*   **Advice:** Actively seek and incorporate problem-specific knowledge, especially spatial relationships, clustering, and gravitational attraction; meticulously normalize individual heuristic components; and implement adaptive weighting schemes based on *multiple* problem characteristics and consider sparsification.

*   **Avoid:** Generic "consider diverse factors." Don't just mention adaptive weighting; focus on making it responsive to multiple problem features.

*   **Explanation:** The goal is to move beyond vague recommendations to actionable strategies by emphasizing the importance of normalization and adaptive weighting schemes to multiple problem characteristics, leading to enhanced robustness and adaptability.
