**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st heuristic incorporates adaptive weights based on `demand_ratio`, while the 20th uses `capacity_ratio` and adjusts weights for distance, depot proximity, and angle cost. The 20th also includes a route balancing heuristic penalizing deviations from ideal route demand, and has a higher number of heuristics components.

(2nd) vs (19th): The 2nd uses capacity ratio to adjust alpha/beta, the 19th uses it to adjust weight_demand/weight_angle. The 19th sparsifies the matrix based on mean, while 2nd uses percentile.
(3rd) vs (18th): Both have the same core heuristics and weights, but 18th normalizes the distance, savings, and depot heuristics, and 3rd doesn't.
(4th) vs (17th): The 4th includes Clustering Coefficient, Angle Cost, Demand Density, and Randomized Perturbation, as well as adaptive weighting based on capacity ratio and node proximity. It normalizes each heuristic component, includes sparsification and normalizes the final matrix. The 17th one only combines distance, demand, savings, and depot proximity.
(5th) vs (16th): Both algorithms are similar.
(6th) vs (15th): 6th incorporates an Angle-based Clustering. Also, 6th's capacity ratio is calculated on the number of customers. 15th calculate adapt weights based on capacity ratio and number of nodes factor.
(7th) vs (14th): Adaptive sparsification in 7th utilizes mean, while 14th applies percentile for adaptive threshold. 14th includes Node Centrality and Demand Density.
(8th) vs (9th): The 8th is simpler, only combining distance, demand, depot proximity, and savings with fixed weights. Sparsification is based on k-NN and a percentile threshold. The 9th normalizes each heuristic, incorporates clustering, adapts weights based on problem characteristics, and uses a higher sparsity.
(10th) vs (11th): They are same.
(12th) vs (13th): They are same.
Overall: More sophisticated heuristics tend to include more factors (clustering, angles, demand density, route balance), adaptive weighting based on multiple problem characteristics, normalization of individual heuristics, and more adaptive sparsification techniques. Simpler heuristics focus primarily on distance, demand, depot proximity, and savings with fixed or simple adaptive weights.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider incorporating diverse factors that influence solution quality, normalizing individual heuristic components, and using adaptive weighting schemes based on multiple problem characteristics to improve performance and robustness. Sparsification is crucial and should be adaptive to the problem instance.
