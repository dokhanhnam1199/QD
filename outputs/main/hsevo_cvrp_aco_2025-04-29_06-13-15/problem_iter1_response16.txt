    """
    Heuristics for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.

    This version incorporates:
    1.  Distance: Edges with shorter distances are preferred.
    2.  Demand Feasibility:  Penalizes edges that would immediately violate capacity constraints if used early in a route.
    3.  Depot Proximity: Prioritizes returning to the depot from nodes that are far from other customers and have high demand.
    4.  Gravitational Attraction: Mimics the gravitational attraction of black holes: Nodes with high demand and/or far from depot will "attract" closer nodes to form clusters.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (shape: n x n).
        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n x 2).
        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (shape: n). The demand of depot is demands[0].
        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n x n).
