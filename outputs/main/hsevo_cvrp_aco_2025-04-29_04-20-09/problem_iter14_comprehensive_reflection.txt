- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." We'll aim for actionable advice.

Here's a revised self-reflection framework:

*   **Keywords:** Problem context, adaptive parameters, normalization, weighted combinations, computational cost, solution quality, experimental validation.

*   **Advice:** Deeply analyze the problem's structure and constraints. Construct adaptive heuristics dynamically adjusting parameters (powers, weights) based on the search progress. Rigorously test and validate heuristics across diverse problem instances.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex weighting schemes without justification. Static parameter tuning; strive for adaptivity. Ignoring computational cost implications when increasing heuristic complexity.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a solid understanding of the underlying problem. Adaptivity allows heuristics to learn and refine their search strategy during execution. Balance between solution quality and computational efficiency is crucial for real-world applications. Normalization prevents features with large magnitudes from dominating heuristic performance.
