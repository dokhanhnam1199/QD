- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls and focusing on actionable insights.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Evaluation, Iterative, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Design an iterative heuristic development process with explicit steps for evaluating performance on diverse problem instances and adapting parameters/strategies based on the results.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization based on limited data or intuition; focus on data-driven refinement.
*   **Explanation:** A rigorous cycle of building, testing, and refining heuristics, informed by quantitative performance analysis, will lead to more robust and effective solutions.
