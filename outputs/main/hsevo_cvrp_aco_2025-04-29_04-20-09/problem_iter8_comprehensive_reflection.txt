- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective in designing heuristics. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, feature interaction, problem-specific context, iterative refinement.
*   **Advice:** Focus on how features *interact* and adapt weights during the search. Analyze performance bottlenecks to guide heuristic refinement.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly normalizing and weighting without understanding feature relationships and the problem's nuances. Static weights.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple normalization and weighting. Prioritize understanding how features influence each other in specific problem instances. Use iterative analysis of solution quality to dynamically adjust heuristic parameters, leading to more robust and effective heuristics.
