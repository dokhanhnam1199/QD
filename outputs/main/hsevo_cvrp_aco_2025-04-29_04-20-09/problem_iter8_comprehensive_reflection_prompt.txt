{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize normalization of input features and weighting of different heuristic components. Sparsification helps to reduce complexity. Consider including angle calculations, centrality, demand density, savings when designing heuristics. Penalize exceeding capacity, and reward connections to depot.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors like distance, demand, angles, and depot proximity. Normalize inputs to a consistent scale and use weighted combinations to balance their influence. Favor more complex, context-aware measures, such as centrality and capacity proximity, to make informed decisions.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors, normalize inputs, consider sparsification to reduce computational cost, and carefully tune the weights of different components to achieve optimal performance. Don't use an if else statement with two similar equations. Instead, adjust/add parameters to equation based on the conditions.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
