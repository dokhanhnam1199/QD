  description: Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution
    sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes
    and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has
    a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the
    vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle
    must return to the starting node.
