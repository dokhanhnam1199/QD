**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st one has a simpler structure using direct multiplicative combination of components, whereas the 20th uses more complex exponential and power-based weighting, and normalization. The 1st also includes angles relative to all other nodes, while the 20th is relative to the depot.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we observe the introduction of sparsification thresholding in the 2nd and adaptive parameter adjustments. The 19th introduces demand density and normalizes the distances but seems to overcomplicate the calculation.
Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), the 3rd one adapts the distance component using exponential decay, calculating the mean distances and the angles relative to the depot. The 18th uses a similar idea for demand density but calculates depot proximity directly.
Comparing (4th) vs (17th), the 4th one makes not any changes compare with the 3rd, so both heuristics are equivalent. The 17th combines normalized distance, demand, depot proximity and centrality.
Comparing (5th) vs (16th), the 5th one makes not any changes compare with the 3rd and 4th, so all heuristics are equivalent. The 16th focuses on normalized distances, demand component, centrality and depot proximity.
Comparing (6th) vs (15th), the 6th heuristic includes adaptive weights and a more sophisticated angle calculation. The 15th introduces demand density calculations.
Comparing (7th) vs (14th), the 7th normalizes distances and uses weighted components with a more traditional angle calculation. The 14th emphasizes demand density and sparsification more heavily.
Comparing (8th) vs (13th), the 8th is identical to the 7th. The 13th, incorporates density component and centralizes the design around depot.
Comparing (9th) vs (12th), the 9th and 10th uses demand density, angle, centrality, and depot proximity with fixed weights. The 11th and 12th are very similar using an enhanced combination of distance, demand, angle, centrality, and depot attraction with adaptive weighting
Comparing (10th) vs (11th), 10th is very similar to 9th but 11th has adaptive weights
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that second worst uses adaptive weighting and normalized components like distance, demand, angle, centrality and depot attaction. The worst (20th) attempt to include all component in the second worst with smoother transition and gaussian penalty but failed.
Overall: The better heuristics tend to incorporate a balance of distance, demand, angle, centrality, and depot considerations but are careful not to overcomplicate the weighting or normalization schemes. Simpler multiplicative combinations with dynamic thresholds for sparsification appear to be effective. Adaptive weights, while promising in theory, don't always lead to superior performance if not carefully tuned.

**Experience:**
Focus on a balanced combination of key features (distance, demand, angle, centrality, depot). Favor simpler multiplicative combinations over complex weighting schemes. Implement dynamic sparsification to reduce search space. Thoroughly test and tune any adaptive parameters.
