- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice derived from best practices and aiming for efficient implementation:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Normalization, Sparsification, Weighting, Context-Awareness, Parameterization, Continuous Functions.

*   **Advice:** Integrate diverse, normalized features into a single, flexible equation using weighted sums and parameter adjustments to handle varying conditions smoothly.

*   **Avoid:** Binary if/else logic that can be replaced with smooth parameter variations within a single equation.

*   **Explanation:** Aim for continuous, adaptable heuristics by parameterizing equations and using feature weighting instead of discrete switching to improve robustness and tunability.
