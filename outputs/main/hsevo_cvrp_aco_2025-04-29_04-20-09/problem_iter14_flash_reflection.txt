**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic combines centrality, capacity, angle, and depot attraction, while the worst uses a combination of distance, demand, angle, and sparsification but with less effective normalization and weighting. The best heuristic also incorporates precomputed depot attraction and angle differences. The worst heuristic also does not check the feasibility of capacity, causing routes to be infeasible.
(2nd best) vs (2nd worst) the second best approach has a more comprehensive consideration of multiple factors (distance, demand, angle, centrality, and depot attraction), combined with adaptive sparsification based on demand and distance.  The 19th ranked heuristic uses powers to tune importance.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st ranked heuristic uses simpler calculations but the 2nd ranked heuristic is a more complex formula, adaptive sparsification, relaxed capacity constraint, and sampling.
(3rd) vs (4th) - No difference, meaning there are duplicate heuristics on the list.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the 19th and 20th heuristics share similar design choices, but the 19th emphasizes demand and angle more and is more likely to provide better results.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more relevant factors (centrality, depot attraction, angle) and employ adaptive techniques. They are more robust in handling capacity constraints and prioritize computational efficiency through normalization or sparsification. They also often use powers to tune the various component.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, consider incorporating a wider range of problem-specific information, tuning parameters using powers, and implementing adaptive strategies for sparsification and weighting components. Prioritize the balance between solution quality and computational cost and test feasibility.
