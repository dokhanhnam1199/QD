Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines centrality, capacity, angle, and depot attraction for CVRP.\"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n    center_x = np.mean(coordinates[1:, 0])\n    center_y = np.mean(coordinates[1:, 1])\n    total_demand = np.sum(demands[1:])\n    demand_weighted_dist_to_depot = np.sum(demands[1:] * distance_matrix[0, 1:]) / total_demand if total_demand > 0 else 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n\n            distance = distance_matrix[i, j]\n            distance_component = 1 / (distance + 1e-6)\n\n            demand_component = 1.0\n            if i != 0 and j != 0 and demands[i] + demands[j] > capacity:\n                demand_component = 0.1\n\n            angle_component = 1.0\n            if i != 0 and j != 0:\n                angles = []\n                for k in range(n):\n                    if k != i and k != j:\n                        v1 = coordinates[i] - coordinates[j]\n                        v2 = coordinates[k] - coordinates[i]\n                        dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)\n                        magnitudes = np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2)\n                        if magnitudes == 0:\n                            angle = 0\n                        else:\n                            angle = np.arccos(dot_product / magnitudes)\n                        angles.append(angle)\n                if len(angles) > 0:\n                    angle_component = min(np.degrees(angles) / 180.0)\n\n            center_distance = (np.sqrt((coordinates[i, 0] - center_x)**2 + (coordinates[i, 1] - center_y)**2) +\n                               np.sqrt((coordinates[j, 0] - center_x)**2 + (coordinates[j, 1] - center_y)**2)) / 2\n            centrality_component = np.exp(-center_distance / demand_weighted_dist_to_depot if demand_weighted_dist_to_depot>0 else 1)\n\n            depot_component = 1.0\n            if i!=0:\n                load_before_depot = demands[i]\n                depot_component = (1 + np.exp(load_before_depot/capacity)) / 2\n\n            heuristic_matrix[i, j] = (distance_component * demand_component * (1 - angle_component) * centrality_component * depot_component)\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `heuristics_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, I understand. Let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective in designing heuristics. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, feature interaction, problem-specific context, iterative refinement.\n*   **Advice:** Focus on how features *interact* and adapt weights during the search. Analyze performance bottlenecks to guide heuristic refinement.\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly normalizing and weighting without understanding feature relationships and the problem's nuances. Static weights.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simple normalization and weighting. Prioritize understanding how features influence each other in specific problem instances. Use iterative analysis of solution quality to dynamically adjust heuristic parameters, leading to more robust and effective heuristics.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
