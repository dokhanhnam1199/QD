**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 2nd heuristic uses Gaussian penalty for demand, adds depot attraction based on distance to the depot and demand balance component; and applies sparsification with a dynamic threshold; (1st) uses hard threshold of capacity.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), the 2nd calculates centrality and depot attraction, and demand balance, and applies sparsification with a dynamic threshold. 3rd normalizes distance, calculates angles relative to the depot, and applies a depot proximity weighting. 2nd includes a more comprehensive set of factors, including demand balance and centrality, and the use of dynamic sparsification. 3rd focuses primarily on distance, demand, depot proximity, and angle to the depot.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), 3rd normalizes distances, calculates angles to the depot, and weights components more simply. 4th introduces the concept of demand density, as well as a center calculation and component. 4th also includes sparsification based on capacity constraints and clips the heuristic matrix values.

Comparing (4th) vs (5th), 4th and 5th are identical.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), 5th uses demand density and centrality components. 6th normalizes distances and demands explicitly and uses weighted averages for distance, demand, and centrality, multiplied by a depot component. Sparsification in 6th is based on a percentile of distances.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th), 6th and 7th are identical.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), 7th and 8th are identical.

Comparing (8th) vs (9th), 8th uses normalized distances, demand components, centrality, and depot attraction, with sparsification. 9th uses distance, savings, demand, and centrality. Savings heuristic is unique to 9th. 9th also ensures depot connections are preferred.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), 9th combines distance, savings, demand, and centrality. 10th combines distance, demand, angle, and depot proximity with fixed weights.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), 10th combines distance, demand, angle, and depot proximity with fixed weights; 11th combines distance, demand, savings, angle, depot proximity; angle is calculated using neighboring nodes; 11th has sparsification.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), 11th uses savings heuristic, and the angle calculation considers other nodes; 12th use a more comprehensive set of components and normalization strategies, along with capacity penalties.

Comparing (12th) vs (13th), 12th uses a more comprehensive set of features, including angle calculations, centrality, depot attraction, and capacity penalties, and employs normalization. 13th focuses on distance, demand, centrality, and depot attraction without explicit angle calculations and uses exponential functions for distance and centrality components. 12th calculates penalty for exceeding capacity.

Comparing (13th) vs (14th), 13th and 14th are identical.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th), 14th combines distance, demand, centrality, and depot attraction, sparsifying based on a dynamic threshold. 15th normalizes and weights distance, demand, angle, centrality, and depot components; 15th uses more robust angle calculation and depot attraction.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), 15th normalizes and weights distance, demand, angle, centrality, and depot components, sparsifying the matrix with a dynamic threshold. 16th normalizes distance, calculates angles relative to the depot, and considers demand density.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), 16th and 17th are identical.

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), 17th and 18th are identical.

Comparing (18th) vs (19th), 18th and 19th are identical.

Comparing (19th) vs (20th), 19th uses normalized distances, demand density, depot proximity and angle difference with smooth weighting. 20th uses distance, demand, angle, centrality and depot attraction, with sparsification. 20th uses mean angle.

Overall:
The better heuristics are characterized by normalization, weighting of components, sparsification and including more components such as centrality, demand density, savings.

**Experience:**
Prioritize normalization of input features and weighting of different heuristic components. Sparsification helps to reduce complexity. Consider including angle calculations, centrality, demand density, savings when designing heuristics. Penalize exceeding capacity, and reward connections to depot.
