- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to avoid pitfalls and design better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Sparsification, Context-Aware Combination, Parameter Sensitivity, Performance Tuning.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize understanding *why* specific features (distance, demand, centrality, etc.) are effective. Explore multiplicative combinations initially, but consider *adaptive* weighting informed by real-time performance.

*   **Avoid:** Rigid, pre-defined weighting schemes. Over-reliance on normalization without understanding feature interactions. Brute-force tuning; focus on principled parameter adjustment based on observed behavior.

*   **Explanation:** Aim for a reflection process that emphasizes understanding *underlying mechanisms* driving heuristic performance, allowing for more targeted adjustments and adaptive strategies. Avoid simply throwing features together with arbitrary weights.
