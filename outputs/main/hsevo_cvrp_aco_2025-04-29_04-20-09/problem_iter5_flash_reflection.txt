**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a weighted average of several components (distance, demand, angle, centrality, depot attraction), whereas the worst focuses on a more basic combination and a separate load estimation.
(2nd best) vs (second worst): the 2nd favors components (distance, demand, angle, centrality, depot attraction, demand balance for CVRP, with sparsification) while the second worst penalizes connections high demand
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the best heuristic uses simpler component calculations (e.g., a direct inverse for distance), while the second best incorporates more sophisticated weighting and sparsification.
(3rd) vs (4th): These two are very similar, only the fourth incorporates a demand density component, and has a more aggressive sparsification strategy.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst tries to normalize values. The worst heuristic doesn't have any normalization.
Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors, including distance, demand, angle, centrality, and depot attraction. They also use normalization and sparsification techniques to improve performance. Simpler heuristics tend to perform worse. The weighting of different components also appears to be crucial. More advanced heuristics also incorporate demand density and balance considerations.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors, normalize inputs, consider sparsification to reduce computational cost, and carefully tune the weights of different components to achieve optimal performance. Don't use an if else statement with two similar equations. Instead, adjust/add parameters to equation based on the conditions.
