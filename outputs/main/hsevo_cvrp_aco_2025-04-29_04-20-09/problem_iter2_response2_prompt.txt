Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling. CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    This version incorporates several factors to estimate the desirability of each edge:\n    - Distance: Shorter distances are preferred.\n    - Demand Compatibility: Edges connecting nodes with combined demands less than the capacity are favored.\n    - Closeness to Depot: Edges connecting nodes far from the depot are penalized.\n    - Angle to Depot: Encourages connections that form 'rounder' routes (avoiding long, thin chains).\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Customer demands (n).

The second heuristic, in contrast, uses normalized distance and penalizes nodes far from the depot, encouraging more connections around the depot. The angle calculation differs; the first finds the sharpest possible turn, while the second calculates the angle relative to the depot.\n\nComparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), the second-best considers closeness to the depot and applies an angle difference penalty, while the second-worst prioritizes edges connecting to nodes closer to the depot and factors in demand, penalizing edges connecting nodes with high combined demand.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (3rd), the first heuristic calculates centrality using demand-weighted distance to the depot, while the third primarily focuses on angular proximity from the depot. The first also explicitly penalizes edges that could cause immediate capacity violations, whereas the third prioritizes edges from the depot.\n\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third heuristic incorporates a depot proximity factor, boosting edges connected to the depot, and penalizes high-demand edges. The fourth focuses on penalizing edges connecting high-demand nodes to each other, using a simpler angle factor.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second-worst considers depot proximity and demand through precomputed depot distances, whereas the worst only focuses on distance to the depot and combines this directly with angle differences, placing less emphasis on demand or capacity.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics tend to incorporate more nuanced considerations, such as centrality, capacity proximity, and angle calculations based on potential routes rather than just angles relative to the depot. They often include normalizing factors and penalties to prevent extreme values from dominating the heuristic matrix. Poorer heuristics are often simpler, relying heavily on inverse distance and basic demand considerations, with less emphasis on the overall route structure and capacity management. The weighting and combination of different heuristic components are also crucial, and the top-ranked heuristics use carefully chosen weights and mathematical operations to balance the influence of each factor.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls and focusing on actionable insights.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Evaluation, Iterative, Validation.\n*   **Advice:** Design an iterative heuristic development process with explicit steps for evaluating performance on diverse problem instances and adapting parameters/strategies based on the results.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization based on limited data or intuition; focus on data-driven refinement.\n*   **Explanation:** A rigorous cycle of building, testing, and refining heuristics, informed by quantitative performance analysis, will lead to more robust and effective solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `heuristics_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
