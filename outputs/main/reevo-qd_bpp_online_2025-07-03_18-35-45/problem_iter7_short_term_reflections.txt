Prioritize feasibility, reward target fill levels, and penalize wasted space effectively.

Incorporate feasibility constraints, target-oriented rewards, utilization rewards, and space/bin size penalties.

Prioritize feasibility, target good utilization, and penalize waste/large bins. Consider multiple factors beyond simple ratios.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect/target fits, and penalize wasted space and large bins.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect/target fits, penalize waste, and consider bin size softly.

Prioritize feasibility and target fill levels. Refine penalties; avoid over-penalizing. Calibrate reward magnitudes carefully.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits and target fill levels; penalize waste and large bins.

Prioritize fitting, target fill levels, and penalize wasted space. Avoid just relying on log ratios.

The better code uses explicit rewards/penalties, target fill ranges, and emphasizes feasibility and waste reduction.

Prioritize feasibility and target fill levels. Use fine-grained, relative penalties for waste and bin size.
