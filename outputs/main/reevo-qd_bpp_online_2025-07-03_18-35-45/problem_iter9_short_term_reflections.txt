Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits and target fill levels, penalize wasted space and larger bins.

The better code prioritizes fitting, fill ratio, target fill proximity, and penalizes wasted space, unlike the worse code.

Prioritize fitting, target fill levels, and penalize wasted space. The log ratio is not effective.

Prioritize near-perfect fits. Heavily penalize infeasible solutions. Subtly penalize large bins.

Prioritize feasibility and target fill levels. Use smaller penalties and avoid hard constraints where possible.

Feasibility first. Reward near-perfect fits and target fill levels. Penalize wasted space and larger bins softly.

Prioritize feasibility. Reward target fills. Penalize waste and larger bins gently. Tighter tolerances help.

Prioritize feasibility, reward good fits and target fills, penalize larger bins and wasted space.

Tighter near-perfect fit, target fill reward, and nuanced waste/size penalties improve bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits and target fill levels; penalize wasted space and larger bins.
