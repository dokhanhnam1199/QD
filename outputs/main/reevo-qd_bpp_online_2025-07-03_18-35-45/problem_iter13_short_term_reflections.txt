Feasibility first, then reward near-perfect fits. Penalize waste and large bins softly. Prioritize smaller, feasible bins.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits and target fills, penalize waste and larger bins.

Tighter tolerances, targeted fill levels, and balanced penalties improve bin packing heuristics.

The better code uses explicit rewards/penalties, target fill levels, and penalized wasted space for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits/target fill, and penalize wasted space/larger bins softly.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits, and penalize wasted space. Consider target fill levels and bin size.

Tighter near-fit, wider target fill, and thresholded waste penalty improve bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits, and use fine-grained waste/size penalties with tuned weights.

Prioritize feasibility, reward target fill levels, and penalize waste more effectively than absolute bin size.

Tighter near-fit, broader target fill, reduced penalties, and prioritize smaller feasible bins improve performance.
