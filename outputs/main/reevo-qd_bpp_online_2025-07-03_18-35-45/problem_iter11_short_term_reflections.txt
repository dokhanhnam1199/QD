Prioritize feasibility, target fill levels, and penalize wasted space more effectively than near-perfect fits.

The better heuristic prioritizes fitting, fill ratio, target fill, and penalizes wasted space.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect and target fills, and penalize wasted space more effectively.

Prioritize feasibility, target fill levels, and then minimize wasted space with tuned penalties.

Prioritize feasibility, reward near-perfect fits, target fill ranges, and penalize wasted space.

Tighter tolerances, target ranges, and nuanced penalties improve bin packing heuristic performance.

Prioritize feasibility and near-perfect fits. Use tighter thresholds and smaller penalties for waste and bin size.

Tighter near-fit definition, target fill range, and balanced rewards/penalties improve bin packing.

Target a broader fill range, prioritize smaller feasible bins, and penalize significant relative waste.

Prioritize fitting, reward efficient fills, penalize wasted space, and target specific fill levels.
