Prioritize fitting, target fill levels, and penalize wasted space for effective bin packing.

Prioritize near-perfect fits. Penalize large bins and exclude bins that cannot fit the item.

Prioritize fitting, target fill levels, and penalize wasted space. Ratios alone are insufficient.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize excessive space, and eliminate infeasible bins. Consider value functions instead of ratios.

Incorporate constraints, target-oriented rewards, utilization, penalties, and bin size awareness for improved heuristics.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize large bins slightly, and exclude bins that cannot fit.

The better code uses constraints, rewards, and penalties tailored to bin packing objectives.

The better code uses explicit rewards/penalties based on fitting, fill ratio, target proximity, and remaining capacity.

Prioritize feasible bins, reward near-perfect fits, penalize excessive space and larger bins. Use target-oriented rewards.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize larger bins softly, and exclude bins that cannot fit the item.
