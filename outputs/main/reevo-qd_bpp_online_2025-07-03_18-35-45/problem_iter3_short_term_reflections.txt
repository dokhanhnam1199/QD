The better code uses explicit constraints, target-oriented reward, and penalties, which guides search effectively.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize excessive space, and exclude infeasible bins using thresholds and penalties.

The better code prioritizes bins that almost perfectly fit the item, penalizes overly large bins, and excludes bins that cannot fit.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize larger bins slightly, and exclude bins that cannot fit.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize excessive space, and strictly avoid infeasible assignments for improved bin packing.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize larger bins moderately, and exclude bins that cannot fit the item.

Prioritize near-perfect fits. Penalize large bins and exclude bins with insufficient capacity.

Consider bin utilization, wasted space, and infeasibility explicitly in your priority function.

Prioritize near-perfect fits, penalize excessive space, and exclude infeasible bins. Explicit constraints often improve performance.

Consider remaining capacity, penalize large bins, and heavily penalize bins that cannot fit the item.
