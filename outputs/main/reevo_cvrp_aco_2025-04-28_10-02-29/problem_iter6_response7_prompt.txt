Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) using stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    Emphasizes depot proximity, normalized demand, and dynamic sparsification thresholds for improved CVRP heuristics.\n    Enhancements include refined parameter tuning, distance-based heuristic, demand-based heuristic,\n    and adaptive sparsification based on vehicle capacity.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix (shape: n by n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Customer demands (shape: n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution\n                    (shape: same as distance_matrix).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristics = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n\n    # Parameters (tunable)\n    alpha = 1.2  # Weight for distance influence\n    beta = 0.9  # Weight for demand attraction\n    gamma = 0.7  # Weight for depot proximity\n    delta = 0.6 # Weight for angle towards depot\n\n    # Calculate depot proximity (normalized distance to depot)\n    depot_distances = distance_matrix[0, :] / np.max(distance_matrix[0, :])\n    depot_proximity = 1 - depot_distances\n\n    # Normalized demand\n    normalized_demands = demands / capacity # Normalize with respect to capacity.\n\n    # Calculate angle to depot\n    angle_to_depot = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            if i != j:\n                vector_i = coordinates[i] - coordinates[0]\n                vector_j = coordinates[j] - coordinates[0]\n                dot_product = np.dot(vector_i, vector_j)\n                magnitudes = np.linalg.norm(vector_i) * np.linalg.norm(vector_j)\n                angle = np.arccos(np.clip(dot_product / (magnitudes + 1e-6), -1.0, 1.0))\n                angle_to_depot[i, j] = 1 - (angle / np.pi)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristics[i, j] = 0  # No self-loops\n            else:\n                # Encourage trips to depot more strongly\n                if i == 0:\n                    depot_prox_factor_i = 1.0\n                else:\n                    depot_prox_factor_i = depot_proximity[i]\n\n                if j == 0:\n                    depot_prox_factor_j = 1.0\n                else:\n                    depot_prox_factor_j = depot_proximity[j]\n\n                heuristics[i, j] = (\n                    (1 / distance_matrix[i, j])**alpha *  # Distance factor\n                    (normalized_demands[i] + normalized_demands[j])**beta * # Demand factor, favoring larger demands\n                    (depot_prox_factor_i * depot_prox_factor_j)**gamma * #Depot Proximity - more important if a node is far from the depot\n                    (angle_to_depot[i, j])**delta\n                )\n\n    # Dynamic Sparsification based on Distance (more aggressive)\n    distance_threshold = np.mean(distance_matrix) + 0.75* np.std(distance_matrix)\n    heuristics[distance_matrix > distance_threshold] = 0\n\n   # Dynamic Sparsification based on Demand relative to Capacity\n    demand_threshold = 0.9  # Cap on demand (as proportion of capacity).
