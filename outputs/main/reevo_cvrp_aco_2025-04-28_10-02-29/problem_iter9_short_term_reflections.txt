Prioritize adaptive sparsification, depot influence, and tuned, normalized factors over simple combinations.

Savings calculation, normalization, adaptive sparsification, and prioritized depot connections improved the heuristic.

Capacity awareness, geometric mean demand, inverse angles, and distance penalization enhance heuristic quality.

Geometric mean for demand, angle scaling (0-1), distance in combined heuristic, adaptive sparsification improved performance.

The better code uses savings, geometric mean demand, inverse angle, capacity awareness, and robust sparsification.

Demand, angle, and distance factor calculations were improved. Sparsity thresholding is dynamically adjusted using capacity.

Geometric mean demand, capacity awareness, inverse angle, and dynamic sparsification improve heuristic performance.

Normalize savings effectively, consider capacity in demand factor and sparsification, and incorporate distance in the combined heuristic.

Capacity constraints, normalized distance, and slightly adjusted weights/threshold improve heuristic quality.

Capacity awareness, geometric mean demand, inverse angle, and dynamic sparsification improve heuristic performance.
