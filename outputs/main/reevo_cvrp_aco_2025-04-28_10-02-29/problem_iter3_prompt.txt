{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nRefine edge scoring with normalized, weighted factors (savings, depot proximity, demand, angle). Dynamically sparsify the edge matrix based on vehicle capacity and edge scores. Prioritize depot connections and adapt thresholds for improved efficiency.\n- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\n\n[Code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix between nodes (n x n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (n x 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Vector of customer demands (n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (n x n).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristics_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n\n    # Calculate savings matrix (Clarke-Wright Savings)\n    savings_matrix = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            savings_matrix[i, j] = distance_matrix[0, i] + distance_matrix[0, j] - distance_matrix[i, j]\n            savings_matrix[j, i] = savings_matrix[i, j]\n\n    # Node proximity to depot\n    depot_proximity = np.zeros(n)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        depot_proximity[i] = 1 / distance_matrix[0, i]\n\n    # Demand factor\n    demand_factor = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            if i != j:\n                demand_factor[i, j] = 1 / (demands[i] + demands[j] + 1e-6)  # Avoid division by zero\n\n\n    # Combine factors, penalizing long distances, edges between nodes with high demands\n    # and rewarding high savings and proximity to the depot\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j:\n                heuristics_matrix[i, j] = (\n                    0.5 * savings_matrix[i, j]\n                    + 0.3 * (depot_proximity[i] + depot_proximity[j])\n                    + 0.2 * demand_factor[i, j]\n                ) / (distance_matrix[i, j] + 1e-6)\n    \n    #Sparsify the matrix (remove edges with small values)\n    threshold = np.percentile(heuristics_matrix[heuristics_matrix > 0], 25) #remove bottom 25%\n    heuristics_matrix[heuristics_matrix < threshold] = 0\n    \n\n    #Set diagonal to zero and make matrix asymmetric\n    for i in range(n):\n        heuristics_matrix[i, i] = 0\n\n    return heuristics_matrix\n\n[Improved code]\nPlease write a mutated function `heuristics_v2`, according to the reflection.
