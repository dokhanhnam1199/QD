Prioritize depot proximity, normalized demand, and dynamic sparsification thresholds for improved CVRP heuristics.

Prioritize distance, demand, and depot proximity with tunable weights and dynamic sparsification based on capacity.

The better code adds angle factor, normalizes factors, uses weights, and applies sparsification more effectively.

Savings calculation, depot proximity, and demand-based penalization with adaptive sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Angle consideration, adaptive thresholds, and combined demand assessment improved heuristic performance.

Normalize features, adapt thresholds, and prioritize trips to/from the depot for improved performance.

Savings calculations, demand-based penalties, and prioritized depot connections yield improved heuristic performance.

Savings, depot proximity, and demand considerations, combined with distance, yield improved edge prioritization.

Savings calculations, normalization, demand consideration, and targeted sparsification improve heuristic performance.

Savings calculation, explicit depot preference, and demand-based edge penalization improved heuristic performance.
