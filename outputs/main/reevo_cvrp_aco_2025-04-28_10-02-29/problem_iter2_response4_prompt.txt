{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

CVRP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node. Each node has a demand and each vehicle has a capacity. The total demand of the nodes visited by a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle capacity. When the total demand exceeds the vehicle capacity, the vehicle must return to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (shape: n by n), Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2), a vector of customer demands (shape: n), and the integer capacity of vehicle capacity. It returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the distance_matrix. The depot node is indexed by 0.\n\n\n[Worse code]\ndef heuristics_v0(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristic function for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n    This version combines several factors to determine the promise of selecting an edge:\n    - Distance between nodes\n    - Demand of the destination node\n    - Closeness to the depot (penalizes edges far from the depot, encouraging depot visits)\n    - Sparsification: Sets unpromising edges to zero based on a threshold.\n\n    Args:\n        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix (shape: n by n).\n        coordinates (np.ndarray): Euclidean coordinates of nodes (shape: n by 2).\n        demands (np.ndarray): Customer demands (shape: n).\n        capacity (int): Vehicle capacity.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: Prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution (shape: n by n).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristic_matrix = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate depot distances\n    depot_distances = distance_matrix[0, :]  # Distance from depot to each node\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j:\n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = 0  # No self-loops\n            else:\n                # Combine factors to determine heuristic value\n                distance_factor = 1 / (distance_matrix[i, j] + 1e-6)  # Avoid division by zero\n                demand_factor = 1 / (demands[j] / capacity + 1e-6) # smaller demand more preferable. maxes at 1 / (1/cap)\n                depot_proximity_factor = np.exp(-depot_distances[j] / np.mean(depot_distances)) # Prefer closer to depot\n                \n                heuristic_matrix[i, j] = distance_factor * demand_factor * depot_proximity_factor\n\n    # Sparsify the matrix:  zero out edges with low heuristic values\n    threshold = np.quantile(heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix > 0], 0.25)  # Remove bottom 25%\n    heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix < threshold] = 0\n\n    #normalize non-zero elements\n\n    non_zero_elements = heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix > 0]\n    if non_zero_elements.size > 0:\n        min_val = np.min(non_zero_elements)\n        max_val = np.max(non_zero_elements)\n        heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix > 0] = (heuristic_matrix[heuristic_matrix > 0] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n\n    return heuristic_matrix\n\n[Better code]\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray, coordinates: np.ndarray, demands: np.ndarray, capacity: int) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Heuristics function for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) via stochastic solution sampling.\n\n    This version combines distance, demand, and angle considerations to create a more informed prior\n    for edge selection.
