Focus on robust sparsification, route diversity, and capacity-aware demand factors with refined weights.

Better code: Geometric demand mean, capacity slack, instance-aware sparsification, dynamic weights, and normalized factors improved heuristic quality.

Non-linear capacity scaling, robust angle handling, and depot affinity improve heuristic quality.

Refine weights, depot prioritization, and sparsification based on instance size and demand/capacity ratio.

Capacity-aware demand, inverse angles, distance penalization, and dynamic sparsification improve heuristic performance.

Penalize capacity violations heavily. Tune weights and depot boosts. Adjust sparsification adaptively.

Refine demand factor, angle handling, sparsification, and depot boosting for better heuristic performance.

Weight tuning, removing capacity utilization-based weight adjustment, and code cleanup improved performance.

Focus on robust demand handling, distance normalization, and adaptive sparsification for improved heuristics.

Capacity-aware demand, angle factor refinement, and adaptive sparsification enhance heuristic performance.
