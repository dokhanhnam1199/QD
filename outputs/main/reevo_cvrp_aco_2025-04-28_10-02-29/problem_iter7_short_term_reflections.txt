The better code normalizes demands, uses angle to depot, and employs more aggressive, adaptive sparsification.

Savings, angles, and normalized, weighted combinations improve CVRP heuristics. Sparsification and depot prioritization are crucial.

Geometric mean demand, inverse angle, distance penalization, and robust sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Normalization, geometric means, angle factor, and prioritized depot connections improved the heuristic.

Geometric mean demand, inverse angle, and distance penalization improve edge selection. Refined sparsification is crucial.

Focus on distance, demand normalization, depot proximity, angle to depot, and adaptive sparsification using problem characteristics.

Normalize factors, include angles, and dynamically sparsify based on capacity and score.

Savings calculation, normalization, depot prioritization, and adaptive sparsification are key improvements.

Geometric mean, refined normalization, and a higher sparsification threshold yield better heuristics.

Geometric mean demand, angle factor, normalization, and dynamic sparsification improve heuristic quality.
