Better heuristics: Normalize features, use dynamic sparsification, and prioritize depot connections and node demands.

Better code normalizes factors, refines weights, and uses dynamic sparsification based on vehicle capacity.

Normalize all factors before combining. Calculate the angle correctly.

Prioritize depot proximity directly, normalize demands, and use distance-based dynamic sparsification with a top-k edge selection.

Geometric mean demand, inverse angle, distance penalization, and refined sparsification improve heuristic quality.

Normalize features, prioritize depot connections, and adapt thresholds dynamically for better performance.

Geometric mean for demand, angle factor, normalization, and distance-based scaling improved the heuristic.

Incorporate savings, angles, and adaptive sparsification. Prioritize depot connections, normalize factors with appropriate weights.

Prioritize depot proximity, combined demand, and savings, scaled by distance, with adaptive sparsification and zero diagonals.

Prioritize depot proximity, normalize demand effectively, and use dynamic sparsification based on distance and demand.
