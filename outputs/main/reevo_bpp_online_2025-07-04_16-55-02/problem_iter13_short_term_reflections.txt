Prioritize waste minimization. Dynamically scale bonuses/penalties based on item size and fit.

Prioritize waste minimization and incentivize tight packing. Consider item size and normalize priorities effectively.

Focus on waste minimization, tight fits, and consolidating items with dynamic penalties.

Prioritize perfect fits. Directly use normalized waste. Improve infeasible bin handling with capacity difference.

Prioritize waste, use dynamic bonuses/penalties, and handle large items/infeasibility strategically for improvements.

Focus on waste minimization, tight fit bonuses, dynamic penalties, and handling infeasibility more gracefully.

Focus on waste minimization, tight fit bonuses, and penalties for small remaining capacities. 

Focus on waste minimization, prioritize tight fits, and handle large items strategically.

Prioritize waste minimization with larger bonuses/penalties and refined thresholds for specialized cases.

Prioritize waste minimization, adjust bonus/penalty magnitudes, and add targeted strategies for large items.
