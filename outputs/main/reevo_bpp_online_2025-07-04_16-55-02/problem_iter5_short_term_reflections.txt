Prioritize tight fits. Normalize if no fit exists. Avoid complex, conflicting bonuses/penalties. Numerical stability is important.

Prioritize perfect fits and penalize infeasible bins. Use inverse wasted space for bins that can fit.

Prioritize feasibility and waste minimization. Add bonuses for near-full bins and penalties for creating almost-empty bins.

Prioritize perfect fits, penalize infeasible bins, and use inverse waste for fitting bins.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, maximize utilization, and combine metrics with appropriate weights.

Combining waste and utilization, weighting utilization higher, and simplified feasibility handling improved performance.

The better code uses a combined waste/utilization metric and strongly penalizes infeasible bins, improving packing efficiency.

Directly optimizing for tightness and normalization when no fit exists improves performance.

Better code uses normalized waste, direct waste minimization, and simpler, clearer bonuses/penalties with fixed thresholds.

Quantify fitting preference, penalize not fitting, and use percentage-based remaining capacity.
