The better code focuses on waste minimization, impactful bonuses/penalties, and large item handling.

The better code normalizes priorities, balances bin usage, and considers current bin fullness.

Prioritize utilization, use smaller, well-tuned bonuses/penalties, and encourage filling existing bins first.

The better code adds small item consolidation. Consider item size relative to bin size and remaining capacity.

The better code directly calculates post-fill levels and incorporates large item incentives and normalization for infeasibility.

The better code adds perfect fit bonus and handles infeasible cases effectively, improving bin utilization.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize waste. Add bonus for large items in nearly empty bins.

Focus on normalized utilization, refined bonuses/penalties, and pre-fill levels for improved bin selection.

The better code improves bin selection by considering item size, dynamically adjusting bonuses and handling infeasibility gracefully.

Prioritize feasible bins first. Refine waste, near-full, and too-little bin rewards/penalties based on remaining capacity.
