The better code avoids redundant indexing and directly incorporates feasibility into near-full/empty bin checks, improving exploration when no feasible bin exists.

Prioritize normalized waste. Explicitly handle infeasibility. Fine-tune bonus/penalty values.

The better code normalizes utilization directly, uses more appropriate bonus/penalty values, and simplifies the overflow handling.

The better code prioritizes balanced bin usage, current fullness, and normalizes priorities for fairer comparison.

Prioritize normalized waste, balance consolidation/fragmentation, and use extreme values (-inf) for infeasibility.

Prioritize feasibility and normalized waste. Refine near-full/too-little bin thresholds and bonuses/penalties based on bin size.

The better code prioritizes normalized utilization and uses smaller, more balanced bonuses/penalties for refined control.

The better code simplifies bonus/penalty adjustments, focuses on consolidation, and prioritizes fullest bins when necessary.

Normalize waste, prioritize balanced bin usage and current fullness, and penalize infeasibility harshly.

Prioritize feasibility checks. Confine calculations to feasible bins. Refine penalties/bonuses based on remaining capacity.
