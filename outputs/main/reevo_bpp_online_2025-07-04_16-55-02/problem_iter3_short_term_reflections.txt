Prioritize perfect fits and penalize infeasible bins heavily. Inverse remaining capacity after fit is also effective.

Prioritize fitting items tightly; penalize overflow proportionally, avoiding bin underutilization penalty.

Prioritize snug fits and penalize near-full or overflowing bins for improved packing.

Focus on clear, independent heuristics. Explicitly reward fitting items and penalize infeasibility.

Prioritize smallest waste. Heavily penalize infeasible bins. Reward almost-full bins to consolidate items.

Better: Prioritize minimal waste using inverse waste. Worse: Disjoint prioritization and arbitrary thresholds.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste, close nearly full bins, and handle cases where no bin fits.

Prioritize tight fits using inverse waste. Normalize when no fit exists. Avoid discrete priority levels.

The better code uses feasibility as a hard constraint and combines waste minimization and utilization effectively.

The better code prioritizes fill percentage, avoids wasted space and forces placement when near full.
