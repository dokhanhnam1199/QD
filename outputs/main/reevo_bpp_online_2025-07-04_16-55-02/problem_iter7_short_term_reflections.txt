Focus on feasibility, normalized waste, near-full bonuses, and consolidation penalties for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility, utilize normalized remaining capacity, and consolidate items via penalties/bonuses.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, minimizes waste, and adds bonuses for near-full and perfect-fit bins.

Directly minimizing normalized waste and increasing the near-full bonus leads to better bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, normalize waste, and encourage near-full/avoid too-empty bins for improved packing.

Prioritize near-full bins, penalize bins with too little remaining capacity, and normalize when infeasible.

The better code normalizes waste, adds bonuses/penalties, and handles near-full/too-little bins, improving consolidation.

Focus on feasibility, waste minimization, consolidation, and avoiding tiny remaining capacities.

The better code uses normalization, explicit penalties/rewards, and feasibility checks for bin selection.

Normalize waste, add near-full bin bonus, and penalize bins becoming too empty for better heuristics.
