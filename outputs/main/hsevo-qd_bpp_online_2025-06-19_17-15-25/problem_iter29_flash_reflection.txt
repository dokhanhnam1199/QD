**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach considering fullness, remaining capacity, adaptive scaling based on item size, and an exploration strategy with randomness, while the worst uses a simple logarithmic ratio of item size to bin capacity.
*   Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), they're similar to the (best) and (worst) pair: the second-best includes fullness, remaining capacity, adaptive scaling, and randomness, while the second-worst uses the same logarithmic ratio. This highlights the importance of considering multiple factors versus relying on a single metric.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see no difference between them. This suggests that their performance might be virtually identical, or the ranking criteria couldn't differentiate them.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the code is identical.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both use the same, very basic logarithmic ratio approach. This confirms the inadequacy of such a simple metric for effective bin packing.
*   Comparing (16th) vs (17th), (16th) considers best fit, fullness, adaptive scaling based on item size and bin capacity, strategic exploration based on remaining capacity and item size. By contrast, (17th) simply calculates priorities based only on fit and remaining capacity with normalization. This shows more comprehensive heuristics are better.
*   Comparing (9th) vs (10th), (9th) includes dynamic weights, and considers fullness, remaining capacity, item size, and adaptive randomness; while (10th) only uses fullness, fit, adaptive scaling and fixed random values.

Overall: The better heuristics use a combination of factors such as fullness, remaining capacity, item size, and exploration to decide where to put the items. Adaptive scaling, which adjusts the priority based on the item size and bin characteristics, is a common feature. The inclusion of randomness, particularly when scaled relative to item size or remaining bin capacity, promotes exploration and can help avoid local optima. The poorer heuristics oversimplify the problem, often relying on a single metric like the ratio of item size to bin capacity. The worst heuristics lack normalization and can result in skewed priorities. Robust handling, such as dealing with edge cases where priorities may be negative, and avoiding division by zero, contributes to the robustness of the heuristics.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, adaptively scale parameters based on the problem context, and incorporate a degree of randomness for exploration. Always ensure the priorities are properly normalized and edge cases are handled robustly.
