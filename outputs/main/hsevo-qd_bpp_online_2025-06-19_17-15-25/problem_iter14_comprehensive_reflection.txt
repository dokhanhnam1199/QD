Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to build better heuristics. We'll focus on actionable insights and avoid pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, adaptive scaling, exploration, robust constraints.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to intelligently balance multiple factors (e.g., fill level, item fit, wasted space). Use adaptive scaling to dynamically adjust priorities based on remaining capacity or problem context. Strategically inject randomness to diversify solutions.

*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on raw ratios or overly simplistic metrics. Over-complicating heuristics with too many unvalidated, dynamically adjusted parameters.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics consider multiple aspects of the problem, adapting to the current state and exploring diverse solutions while respecting constraints, leading to improved performance.
