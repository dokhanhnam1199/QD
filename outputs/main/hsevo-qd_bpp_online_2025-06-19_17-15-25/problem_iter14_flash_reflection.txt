**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (14th), we see 1st includes randomness for exploration while 14th doesn't. 1st prioritizes bins based on fullness, fit, adaptive scaling, and randomness while 14th focuses mainly on fullness and fit.
*   Comparing (8th) vs (14th), we see 8th is better because it has parameters for random component weight and a more complex priority calculation to minimize fragmentation; also uses `division_eps` to avoid division by zero. 14th is simpler but less adaptable.
*   Comparing (10th) vs (11th), we see 10th has adaptive scaling based on item size, penalizes near misses. 11th only has adaptive scaling based on remaining capacity.
*   Comparing (20th) vs (18th), we see that 20th penalizes near misses (bins that almost fit), which 18th does not. 20th also includes a dynamic exploration factor scaled based on the number of suitable bins, while 18th uses a fixed exploration noise. 20th includes a fallback strategy when no bins fit.
*   Comparing (15th) vs (14th), we see 15th provides more parameters to control the heuristic's behavior (e.g., `fit_priority_scale`, `no_fit_priority`, `avoid_zero_division`, `priority_initial_value`), offering greater flexibility and potential for fine-tuning, while 14th uses hardcoded values.

Overall: The better heuristics prioritize bins by considering fullness, fit (remaining capacity), and use adaptive scaling to the item size or remaining capacity, and add a small random component to encourage exploration; normalize priorities, handle edge cases, and provide more parameters to control behavior.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider adaptive scaling based on the item size or remaining capacity, explore edge cases, and fine-tune the algorithm's behavior with adjustable parameters. Adding randomness helps in avoiding local optima. Normalization of the final priorities is crucial.
