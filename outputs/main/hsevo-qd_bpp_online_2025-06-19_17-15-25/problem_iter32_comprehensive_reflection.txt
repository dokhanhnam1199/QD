Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" distilled into actionable advice for heuristic design, along with what to avoid, and a rationale:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, Adaptive Scaling, Exploration, Normalization, Edge Cases, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Integrate multiple relevant factors using adaptive scaling to dynamically adjust priorities, incorporate controlled randomness for exploration, and rigorously handle edge cases. Validate through testing.
*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification (raw ratios), over-complication (too many unvalidated dynamic weights), fixed constants, ignoring constraints/edge cases.
*   **Explanation:** Combine diverse criteria for a comprehensive evaluation. Adaptive scaling adjusts to problem characteristics. Exploration prevents getting stuck in local optima. Normalization ensures consistent probability-based selection. Robust edge case handling guarantees reliability. Thorough validation is critical for effectiveness.
