**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the first one considers whether the item fits into the bin and prioritizes based on remaining capacity, while the last one uses the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity, without explicit handling of bins where the item doesn't fit.
*   (2nd) vs (12th) is similar to above with configurable parameters in the 2nd.
*   (6th) vs (11th), the 6th prioritizes bins that are already relatively full and adds randomness, while the 11th uses log ratios without considering fullness or randomness.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 2nd one has configurable parameters while first one does not.
*   (3rd) vs (4th) is similar to above.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they're identical.
*   Overall: The better heuristics explicitly consider the fit of the item into the bin and prioritize minimizing waste. They often include normalization and handle cases where the item doesn't fit. Adding randomness and prioritizing fuller bins are also potentially beneficial strategies. Worse heuristics focus solely on ratios without these considerations. The introduction of configurable parameters improved the results.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize fitting items into bins and minimizing wasted space. Consider normalizing priorities and adding randomness for exploration. Adding configurable parameters can significantly enhance performance through experimentation and tuning. Avoid overly simplistic calculations like raw ratios without fit considerations.
