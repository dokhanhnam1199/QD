**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic prioritizes fullness, fit, adaptive scaling, and randomness, normalizing the priorities, while the worst simply calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity without considering fit or fullness. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst) (2nd) vs (19th) are identical to (1st) vs (20th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical, indicating redundancy. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical to (1st) vs (2nd). Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the heuristics are identical, meaning they produce the same result. The better heuristics include more factors like fullness, scaling, and randomness, while the worse heuristics focus solely on a ratio and lack normalization or handling of infeasible bins. The best heuristics also explicitly handle cases where the item doesn't fit. Heuristics 9 and 13 are attempts at incorporating multiple factors with weighting and dynamic adjustment, but they fall lower in the ranking, possibly due to overcomplexity or less effective weighting strategies.

Overall: The better performing heuristics balance multiple factors, including fit, fullness, scaling, and randomness, while effectively penalizing infeasible solutions and normalizing priorities. Simpler heuristics that only consider a single factor, like capacity ratio, perform poorly. Attempts at more complex, multi-factor heuristics need careful weighting and dynamic adjustment to outperform simpler, well-balanced approaches. Code duplication exists in the list.

**Experience:**
Prioritize a balance of multiple relevant factors (fit, fullness, scaling, randomness) when designing heuristics. Implement clear penalty for infeasible solutions and normalize outputs. Avoid over-complicating the heuristic with too many dynamically adjusted weights without rigorous validation.
