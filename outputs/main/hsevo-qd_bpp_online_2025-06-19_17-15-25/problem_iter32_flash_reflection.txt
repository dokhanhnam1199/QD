**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of fullness, remaining capacity, adaptive scaling, and exploration, while the worst primarily focuses on scaling based on remaining capacity with a fixed exploration. The best includes adaptive weighting of fullness and remaining capacity based on item size, encouraging larger items to favor fuller bins. The worst only considers fit and penalizes non-fit.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), we see (2nd) uses a combination of fullness and remaining capacity, and adaptive scaling based on item size, while (19th) prioritizes bins based on remaining capacity, fit, item size, and bin occupancy, with adaptive scaling and exploration. The difference is (19th) incorporates occupancy priority and dynamic weight adjustment, making it more sophisticated.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first one adaptively scales weights for fullness and remaining capacity based on item size, giving larger items higher weight to fullness.  It also has exploration strength that scales with item size, while the second scales exploration with the inverse.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see (4th) introduces data-driven scaling based on item and bin characteristics which is a significant improvement, while (3rd) uses adaptive scaling based on item size. (4th) also has calibrated randomness using bin capacity awareness.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see (second worst) uses slightly more contextual information, but both are relatively basic. (20th) is the worst as it only uses scaling factor, fit priority and a no-fit penalty.

Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors such as fullness, remaining capacity, adaptive scaling, and exploration. They adapt weights and scaling based on item size and bin characteristics. Also, they include more sophisticated exploration strategies. Normalization is also crucial.

**Experience:**
Prioritize a combination of factors like fit, fullness, and exploration when designing heuristics. Adapt parameters based on item characteristics and bin states. Normalize priorities to create a probability distribution.
