Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective in guiding heuristic design.

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, adaptive, robust, experimental.
*   **Advice:** Focus on creating heuristics that are adaptable to specific problem instance characteristics. Experiment to find the best parameters.
*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification and over-complication. Avoid prematurely fixing parameters.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a balanced approach to heuristic design that considers fit, fullness, randomness, normalization, and penalty. Make your heuristics more dynamic.
