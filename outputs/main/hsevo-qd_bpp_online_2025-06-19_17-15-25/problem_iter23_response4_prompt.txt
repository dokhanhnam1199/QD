(2nd best) vs (second worst), adaptive scaling is present in both, but the weighting and randomness are different. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first incorporates a more refined exploration strategy that is item-size aware and uses decaying randomness. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these heuristics are nearly identical, highlighting the sensitivity of the ranking and potential for minor variations to have a significant impact. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both use predefined constants, but the 19th uses slightly more descriptive variable names. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize a nuanced combination of factors including best fit, fullness, adaptive scaling based on item size and remaining capacity, and strategic exploration. They dynamically adjust parameters based on item characteristics and available bin capacities, and handle edge cases robustly. Worse heuristics over-rely on constants, are less adaptive, and have less sophisticated exploration. Normalization methods are consistently applied to ensure probabilities sum to 1.\n- \nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Data-driven adaptation, contextual scaling, robust handling, calibrated randomness.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that learn from problem instance data, dynamically adjusting parameters based on context (item sizes, bin capacities, constraints) rather than relying on static values.\n*   **Avoid:** Generic considerations of \"all constraints\" or \"normalization.\" Instead, focus on specific, measurable improvements derived from problem data.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply acknowledging factors to implementing data-informed adjustments. Shift from static weighting to dynamic, context-aware scaling. Prioritize measurable robustness enhancements.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
