Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) reveals a similar pattern: adaptive scaling, fullness, and exploration are superior to a simple fit-based approach. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the exploration factor calculation differ. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd uses more explicit parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see using scaling based on how much empty space left in bin is bad and using the inverse is better; Overall: the better heuristics combine multiple factors like fit, fullness, and exploration, and normalizes the priorities. Adaptive scaling based on the item size and bin capacities improves performance. Introducing randomness helps in exploration. The explicit handling of edge cases, such as normalization, and bins where the item doesn't fit, also contributes to better results.\n- \nOkay, let's refine our approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on practical application and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted Evaluation, Adaptive Prioritization, Guided Randomness, Robustness Testing.\n\n*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each factor (fullness, fit, etc.) via performance metrics and use that to inform adaptive prioritization. Test robustness by generating diverse edge cases.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague \"considerations\" or \"balance\" without specific implementation details. Avoid over-parameterization without validation on a diverse test suite.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply listing factors. The goal is to design a process of *quantifying* their impact and *dynamically* adjusting the heuristic. Focus on rigorous testing, especially around constraints.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
