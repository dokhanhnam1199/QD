Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable strategies while avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a redefined self-reflection framework:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive tuning, constrained exploration, performance profiling, solution landscape.

*   **Advice:** Implement adaptive parameter tuning based on real-time performance profiling during the search. Explore the solution landscape by intelligently perturbing promising solutions, respecting bin capacity constraints.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly applying penalties without understanding their impact on the search trajectory. Relying on fixed parameter settings without empirical validation.

*   **Explanation:** Adaptive tuning allows heuristics to learn and improve during execution. Constrained exploration prevents wasting computational effort on infeasible solutions while still searching for better packings. Performance profiling guides optimization efforts.
