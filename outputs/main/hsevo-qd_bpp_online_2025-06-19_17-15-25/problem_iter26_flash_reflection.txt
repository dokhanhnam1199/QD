**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates fullness, remaining capacity, adaptive scaling based on item size, and a refined exploration strategy using randomness, along with normalization. The worst heuristic only calculates a ratio of item size to remaining capacity and takes the negative logarithm. (2nd best) vs (second worst), the second worst only use log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the code is identical, implying their performance is extremely close, maybe identical. (3rd) vs (4th), these are also identical, suggesting the ranking might be based on subtle differences not apparent in the code itself or is incorrect. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both use log ratios, but the worst lacks any handling of edge cases or normalization. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the 1st one uses fullness factor, Remaining capacity factor, combined priority, Adaptive scaling based on item size and Refined exploration strategy. The 11th one just calculates the remaining capacity and applies a simple priority based on it. Overall: The better heuristics prioritize a combination of factors like fullness, remaining capacity, and adaptive scaling, use a bit of randomness for exploration and normalization of priorities, while penalizing invalid placements. The weaker heuristics rely on simpler metrics or fail to normalize, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and normalizing the results. Adaptive scaling and controlled randomness can enhance exploration. Always handle edge cases and invalid solutions explicitly. Remember to prioritize thorough testing to confirm the effectiveness of a new heuristic.
