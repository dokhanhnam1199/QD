**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of fullness, remaining capacity, adaptive scaling, and a refined exploration strategy, while the worst heavily relies on pre-defined constants and lacks dynamic adaptation. (2nd best) vs (second worst), adaptive scaling is present in both, but the weighting and randomness are different. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first incorporates a more refined exploration strategy that is item-size aware and uses decaying randomness. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these heuristics are nearly identical, highlighting the sensitivity of the ranking and potential for minor variations to have a significant impact. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both use predefined constants, but the 19th uses slightly more descriptive variable names. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize a nuanced combination of factors including best fit, fullness, adaptive scaling based on item size and remaining capacity, and strategic exploration. They dynamically adjust parameters based on item characteristics and available bin capacities, and handle edge cases robustly. Worse heuristics over-rely on constants, are less adaptive, and have less sophisticated exploration. Normalization methods are consistently applied to ensure probabilities sum to 1.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize dynamic adaptation based on problem instance characteristics. Balance exploitation (best fit, fullness) with exploration (randomness). Avoid over-reliance on fixed constants; instead, adapt parameters based on data. Thoroughly handle edge cases (e.g., no feasible bins, negative priorities) and ensure normalization yields valid probability distributions.
