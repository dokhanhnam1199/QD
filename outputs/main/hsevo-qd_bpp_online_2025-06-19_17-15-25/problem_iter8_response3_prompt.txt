Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

In contrast, the worst heuristic directly calculates `item / bins_remain_cap`, takes its log, and uses the negative log as priority without checking if the item fits or normalizing. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th) the same pattern persists. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) they are also identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: Good heuristics consider remaining capacity, introduce randomness for exploration, adaptively scale priorities, handle edge cases, and normalize the output. Worse heuristics lack these features, directly applying simple calculations without considering constraints or normalization, potentially leading to inefficient packing.\n- \nOkay, I understand. Let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective self-reflection.\"\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, contextual adaptation, exploration-exploitation balance, constraint-aware design.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize *integrated* evaluation of factors (not just considering multiple factors independently). Implement adaptive mechanisms driven by real-time problem context feedback. Strategically introduce randomness to balance exploration and exploitation.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on normalization without considering the *reason* behind it; Simply penalizing infeasible solutions without incorporating strategies to *guide* the search towards feasibility; treating constraints as afterthoughts.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection requires holistic thinking, dynamic adjustments, and proactive constraint management to guide the search process towards optimal solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
