Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown to guide the process:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive scaling, normalization, multi-factor consideration, exploration (randomness), edge cases, configurable parameters, robustness, infeasibility penalties.

*   **Advice:** Focus on dynamically adjusting heuristic priorities based on item sizes, bin capacities, and remaining space. Normalization of priorities makes selection consistent. Rigorously test and tune configurable parameters to avoid overfitting.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplified calculations, neglecting edge cases and constraints, overly complex dynamically adjusted weights without validation, ignoring infeasible solutions.

*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create heuristics that are both efficient and robust. Adaptive scaling improves adaptability to different problem instances. Normalization ensures fair comparison of priorities. Exploration helps escape local optima. Configurable parameters enable fine-tuning. Proper handling of edge cases ensures reliability.
