{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize a balance of multiple relevant factors (fit, fullness, scaling, randomness) when designing heuristics. Implement clear penalty for infeasible solutions and normalize outputs. Avoid over-complicating the heuristic with too many dynamically adjusted weights without rigorous validation.\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize fitting items into bins and minimizing wasted space. Consider normalizing priorities and adding randomness for exploration. Adding configurable parameters can significantly enhance performance through experimentation and tuning. Avoid overly simplistic calculations like raw ratios without fit considerations.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors (fullness, fit), add randomness for exploration, and normalize the output. Adaptive scaling can help to dynamically adjust priorities based on problem context. Always handle edge cases and constraints to ensure robustness.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider all constraints (e.g., item fitting in a bin). Normalization can improve relative comparison. Assign large penalties to avoid infeasible solutions. Consider edge cases.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
