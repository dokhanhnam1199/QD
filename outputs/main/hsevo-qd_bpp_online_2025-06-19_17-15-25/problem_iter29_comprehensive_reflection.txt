Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for improved heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown for effective heuristic design, incorporating your feedback:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, Adaptive Scaling, Controlled Randomness, Normalization, Edge Cases, Validation, Context-Aware.
*   **Advice:** Combine factors contextually. Adapt parameter scaling dynamically. Use controlled randomness for exploration and normalization. Handle all edge cases. Test the effectiveness thoroughly.
*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, overly-complex dynamic adjustments without validation, fixed constants, infeasible solution generation.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics blend informed choices with exploration, adapting to specific problem characteristics. Rigorous testing is vital.
