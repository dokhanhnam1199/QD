**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses adaptive scaling, fit, fullness, exploration, and normalization, while the worst uses only log ratios. (2nd best) vs (second worst) reveals a similar pattern: adaptive scaling, fullness, and exploration are superior to a simple fit-based approach. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the exploration factor calculation differ. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd uses more explicit parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see using scaling based on how much empty space left in bin is bad and using the inverse is better; Overall: the better heuristics combine multiple factors like fit, fullness, and exploration, and normalizes the priorities. Adaptive scaling based on the item size and bin capacities improves performance. Introducing randomness helps in exploration. The explicit handling of edge cases, such as normalization, and bins where the item doesn't fit, also contributes to better results.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors, use adaptive scaling, incorporate randomness for exploration, handle edge cases explicitly, and normalize outputs. Prioritize fitting items into already full bins.
