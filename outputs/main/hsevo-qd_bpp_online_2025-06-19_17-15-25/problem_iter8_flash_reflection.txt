**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates fullness, fit, adaptive scaling, and randomness, along with normalization and handling of non-fitting items. In contrast, the worst heuristic directly calculates `item / bins_remain_cap`, takes its log, and uses the negative log as priority without checking if the item fits or normalizing. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th) the same pattern persists. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) they are also identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: Good heuristics consider remaining capacity, introduce randomness for exploration, adaptively scale priorities, handle edge cases, and normalize the output. Worse heuristics lack these features, directly applying simple calculations without considering constraints or normalization, potentially leading to inefficient packing.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors (fullness, fit), add randomness for exploration, and normalize the output. Adaptive scaling can help to dynamically adjust priorities based on problem context. Always handle edge cases and constraints to ensure robustness.
