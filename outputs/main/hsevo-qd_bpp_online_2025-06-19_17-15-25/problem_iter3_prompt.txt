Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    \n    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item.\n    remaining_capacity = bins_remain_cap - item\n    \n    # Give high priority to bins where the item fits and leaves minimal waste.\n    fit_indices = remaining_capacity >= 0\n    if np.any(fit_indices):\n        priorities[fit_indices] = 1 / (remaining_capacity[fit_indices] + 1e-9)  # Avoid division by zero\n    \n    # Give a very low priority (or negative) to bins where the item doesn't fit.\n    priorities[remaining_capacity < 0] = -1e9  # Large negative value\n        \n    # Normalize the priorities\n    if np.sum(priorities) > 0:\n        priorities = priorities / np.sum(priorities)\n    elif np.sum(priorities) < 0:\n      priorities = priorities - np.min(priorities)\n      priorities = priorities / np.sum(priorities)\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.\n\nHere's a redefined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Solution space analysis, Constraint handling, Adaptive penalties, Iterative refinement.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically explore the solution space's structure. Adapt penalty magnitudes based on search progress. Decompose the problem and address sub-problems using tailored heuristics.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, rigid penalty schemes, neglecting problem-specific structure, relying solely on intuition without experimentation.\n*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should evolve from understanding the problem's landscape. Don't get stuck; vary your approach and adapt penalties during the search process to guide towards feasibility and optimality.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
