**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the better heuristic incorporates remaining capacity, fit indices, and normalization, while the worse heuristic uses only item/bin ratios and log ratios.
*   (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that the second best also incorporates randomness, normalization, and fit indices. In contrast, the second worst uses a simple division to calculate remaining capacities without considering the item's fit.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both are identical, suggesting that their performance is the same, and likely near optimal given the information available.
*   (3rd) vs (4th), we see the introduction of configurable parameters (randomness strength, no fit priority, epsilon) in the 4th heuristic. This allows for fine-tuning but doesn't necessarily guarantee better performance without proper parameter setting.
*   Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), the second worst prioritizes based on remaining capacity and penalizes bins where items don't fit, whereas the worst simply calculates ratios. The normalization in the second worst is also important.
*   Overall: The superior heuristics integrate fit, fullness (remaining capacity), adaptive scaling, exploration (randomness), and proper normalization of priorities. Penalizing bins where items don't fit is a consistent theme. Adaptive scaling considers the relationship between item size and bin capacity. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on ratios or without normalization tend to perform worse. The best approaches use adaptive scaling based on average bin capacities and a small amount of randomness for exploration.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristic design for bin packing involves balancing exploitation (fitting items tightly) with exploration (introducing randomness). Normalization of priorities is crucial for consistent and meaningful selection. Adaptive scaling, which dynamically adjusts priority based on item size and bin capacity, improves the heuristic's adaptability.
