Okay, let's refine our approach to self-reflection for designing better heuristics, focusing on practical application and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted Evaluation, Adaptive Prioritization, Guided Randomness, Robustness Testing.

*   **Advice:** Quantify the impact of each factor (fullness, fit, etc.) via performance metrics and use that to inform adaptive prioritization. Test robustness by generating diverse edge cases.

*   **Avoid:** Vague "considerations" or "balance" without specific implementation details. Avoid over-parameterization without validation on a diverse test suite.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply listing factors. The goal is to design a process of *quantifying* their impact and *dynamically* adjusting the heuristic. Focus on rigorous testing, especially around constraints.
