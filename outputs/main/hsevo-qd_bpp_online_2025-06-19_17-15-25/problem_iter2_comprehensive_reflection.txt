Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.

Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Solution space analysis, Constraint handling, Adaptive penalties, Iterative refinement.
*   **Advice:** Systematically explore the solution space's structure. Adapt penalty magnitudes based on search progress. Decompose the problem and address sub-problems using tailored heuristics.
*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, rigid penalty schemes, neglecting problem-specific structure, relying solely on intuition without experimentation.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should evolve from understanding the problem's landscape. Don't get stuck; vary your approach and adapt penalties during the search process to guide towards feasibility and optimality.
