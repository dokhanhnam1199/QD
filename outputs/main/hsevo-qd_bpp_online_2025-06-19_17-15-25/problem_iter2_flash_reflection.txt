**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first 10 functions are identical and perform normalization to the priorities while the last 10 only calculates a log ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. This normalization is key. The first 10 functions also prioritize bins where the item fits and leaves minimal waste, and penalize bins where the item doesn't fit with a large negative priority. The last functions prioritize bins based on the log ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Thus, the last functions fail to consider the case where an item does not fit.
Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see the first function performs normalization. Normalization may allow the algorithm to better compare bins on a relative basis.

Overall: The best heuristics consider whether an item fits into a bin and explicitly penalize bins where it doesn't fit. Also, normalization is a crucial part of a good heuristic because it allows comparison of bins on a relative basis.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider all constraints (e.g., item fitting in a bin). Normalization can improve relative comparison. Assign large penalties to avoid infeasible solutions. Consider edge cases.
