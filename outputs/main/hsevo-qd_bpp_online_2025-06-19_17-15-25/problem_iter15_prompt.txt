Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Prioritizes bins using adaptive scaling, fit, fullness, and exploration.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    remaining_capacity = bins_remain_cap - item\n    fit_indices = remaining_capacity >= 0\n\n    if np.any(fit_indices):\n        # Adaptive scaling based on remaining capacity and item size\n        scale = np.mean(bins_remain_cap[fit_indices]) + item\n        priorities[fit_indices] = (bins_remain_cap[fit_indices] / scale) / (remaining_capacity[fit_indices] + 1e-9)\n\n\n        # Dynamic exploration factor\n        exploration_factor = min(0.1, 0.01 * np.sum(fit_indices))\n        priorities[fit_indices] += np.random.rand(np.sum(fit_indices)) * exploration_factor\n\n    # Penalize bins where item doesn't fit\n    priorities[remaining_capacity < 0] = -1e9\n\n    # Normalize priorities\n    if np.sum(priorities) > 0:\n        priorities = priorities / np.sum(priorities)\n    elif np.sum(priorities) < 0:\n        priorities = priorities - np.min(priorities)\n        priorities = priorities / np.sum(priorities)\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to build better heuristics. We'll focus on actionable insights and avoid pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, adaptive scaling, exploration, robust constraints.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics to intelligently balance multiple factors (e.g., fill level, item fit, wasted space). Use adaptive scaling to dynamically adjust priorities based on remaining capacity or problem context. Strategically inject randomness to diversify solutions.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on raw ratios or overly simplistic metrics. Over-complicating heuristics with too many unvalidated, dynamically adjusted parameters.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics consider multiple aspects of the problem, adapting to the current state and exploring diverse solutions while respecting constraints, leading to improved performance.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
