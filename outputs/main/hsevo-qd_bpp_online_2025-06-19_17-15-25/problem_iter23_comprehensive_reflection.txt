Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable improvements:

*   **Keywords:** Data-driven adaptation, contextual scaling, robust handling, calibrated randomness.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that learn from problem instance data, dynamically adjusting parameters based on context (item sizes, bin capacities, constraints) rather than relying on static values.
*   **Avoid:** Generic considerations of "all constraints" or "normalization." Instead, focus on specific, measurable improvements derived from problem data.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply acknowledging factors to implementing data-informed adjustments. Shift from static weighting to dynamic, context-aware scaling. Prioritize measurable robustness enhancements.
