{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and normalizing the results. Adaptive scaling and controlled randomness can enhance exploration. Always handle edge cases and invalid solutions explicitly. Remember to prioritize thorough testing to confirm the effectiveness of a new heuristic.\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, prioritize fitting items into bins and minimizing wasted space. Consider normalizing priorities and adding randomness for exploration. Adding configurable parameters can significantly enhance performance through experimentation and tuning. Avoid overly simplistic calculations like raw ratios without fit considerations.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors (fullness, fit), add randomness for exploration, and normalize the output. Adaptive scaling can help to dynamically adjust priorities based on problem context. Always handle edge cases and constraints to ensure robustness.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider adaptive scaling based on the item size or remaining capacity, explore edge cases, and fine-tune the algorithm's behavior with adjustable parameters. Adding randomness helps in avoiding local optima. Normalization of the final priorities is crucial.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors, use adaptive scaling, incorporate randomness for exploration, handle edge cases explicitly, and normalize outputs. Prioritize fitting items into already full bins.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider all constraints (e.g., item fitting in a bin). Normalization can improve relative comparison. Assign large penalties to avoid infeasible solutions. Consider edge cases.\n\nPrioritize a balance of multiple relevant factors (fit, fullness, scaling, randomness) when designing heuristics. Implement clear penalty for infeasible solutions and normalize outputs. Avoid over-complicating the heuristic with too many dynamically adjusted weights without rigorous validation.\n\nEffective heuristic design for bin packing involves balancing exploitation (fitting items tightly) with exploration (introducing randomness). Normalization of priorities is crucial for consistent and meaningful selection. Adaptive scaling, which dynamically adjusts priority based on item size and bin capacity, improves the heuristic's adaptability.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize dynamic adaptation based on problem instance characteristics. Balance exploitation (best fit, fullness) with exploration (randomness). Avoid over-reliance on fixed constants; instead, adapt parameters based on data. Thoroughly handle edge cases (e.g., no feasible bins, negative priorities) and ensure normalization yields valid probability distributions.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
