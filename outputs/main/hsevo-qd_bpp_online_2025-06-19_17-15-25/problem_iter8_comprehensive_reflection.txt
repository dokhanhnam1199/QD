Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, contextual adaptation, exploration-exploitation balance, constraint-aware design.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize *integrated* evaluation of factors (not just considering multiple factors independently). Implement adaptive mechanisms driven by real-time problem context feedback. Strategically introduce randomness to balance exploration and exploitation.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on normalization without considering the *reason* behind it; Simply penalizing infeasible solutions without incorporating strategies to *guide* the search towards feasibility; treating constraints as afterthoughts.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection requires holistic thinking, dynamic adjustments, and proactive constraint management to guide the search process towards optimal solutions.
