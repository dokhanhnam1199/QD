Okay, I understand! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be *more* effective for designing better heuristics, keeping your preferences in mind and avoiding the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection.

Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, adaptive scaling, constraint satisfaction, rigorous validation, exploration/exploitation balance.

*   **Advice:** Critically examine the heuristic's performance considering trade-offs between competing objectives (e.g., fit vs. fullness). Investigate adaptive scaling of parameters based on real-time feedback from the search process. Design clear metrics to measure performance.

*   **Avoid:** Superficial constraint consideration, normalization without justification, solely relying on penalties for infeasibility, ignoring validation.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply *considering* factors to actively *evaluating* their interplay. Adaptive scaling should be data-driven and validated, not arbitrary. Emphasize rigorous validation to prevent overfitting.
