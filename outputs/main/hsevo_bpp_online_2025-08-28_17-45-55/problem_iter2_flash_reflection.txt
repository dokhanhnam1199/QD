**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` from the best (1st) vs. the worst (20th) heuristics, the key difference lies in how priority is assigned. The best version intelligently prioritizes bins by minimizing waste (`np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item)` and assigning a higher priority to the best fit). The worst, and many subsequent versions, simply use `bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item` directly, which doesn't account for the overall goal of minimizing wasted space.

Comparing the 1st vs. 2nd, they are identical, showcasing an initial lack of variation. From 3rd-4th, there is a shift towards calculating waste, but the 3rd uses `np.where` unnecessarily making it slightly less efficient. Between 4th and 5th, there’s again identical code, suggesting redundancy.  The 6th introduces a `fit_level` representing item size relative to remaining capacity, which is a good concept. 7th attempts an exponential weighting, but normalizes by the sum of fit scores, adding complexity without clear benefit. 8th uses a raw ratio of remaining space to capacity.

The 9th-10th introduces a sigmoid function (1 / (1 + exp(-x))), attempting a smoother priority distribution, coupled with `np.std` for normalization. This is a solid improvement, but relies on the standard deviation, potentially being sensitive to outliers.  Heuristics 11th-13th use the inverse of remaining space (`1 / (bins_remain_cap - item)`). This amplifies differences but can become unstable when the remaining space is very small (division by a small number). 14th-17th use `bins_remain_cap - item` but assign -1 for invalid bins, which isn’t helpful. Finally, 18th-20th revert to the basic waste calculation.

Overall: The best heuristics focus on *minimizing waste*, either directly or through a smooth function. Using inverse waste creates potential instability. The best solutions avoid unnecessary code or complexity and prioritize bins with the least wasted space. The consistent issue across the lower-ranked heuristics is the lack of nuance in prioritizing bins beyond simple feasibility.

**Experience:**

Prioritize solutions that directly address the bin packing objective (minimizing waste). Avoid unstable operations (division by small numbers). A smooth, normalized priority function (like a sigmoid) can improve performance. Keep the code concise and avoid redundancy. Normalize scores carefully and consider the impact of outliers.
