Okay, here's a refined self-reflection guide focused on heuristic *design*, drawing from the provided texts, aiming for that $999K reward!

* **Keywords:** Adaptability, Dynamic Parameters, Exploration/Exploitation Balance, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Focus on *how* parameters interact, not just tuning individual values. Prioritize mechanisms for dynamic parameter adjustment *based on problem state* – monitor performance & adjust. Explore combinations of mild penalties *and* boosts.
* **Avoid:** Over-reliance on problem-specific normalization (waste/sigmoid). Premature optimization for bin-packing *alone*; focus on heuristic *structure*. Constant scaling if adaptability is desired.
* **Explanation:** The previous reflection fixated on *bin packing* performance. This revision centers on building *flexible* heuristics. Adaptability—through dynamic parameters & balanced exploration—is crucial for generalization and superior long-term performance across varying problem instances.
