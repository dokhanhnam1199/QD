**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the 1st introduces pre-defined `sigmoid_scale` and `best_bin_boost` constants, likely tuned for better performance across various scenarios, while the 2nd calculates these values dynamically. The dynamic approach in 2nd seems less stable. Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the 3rd adds a decaying boost based on `iteration`, intending to focus on best-fit early on and explore more later. However, this introduces a dependency on iteration number, making the heuristic stateful, and it's not immediately clear if the decay rate is optimal.  Comparing 3rd vs 4th, they are identical. Comparing 5th vs 6th, 5th normalizes the waste using standard deviation which can improve stability. 6th is similar to 2nd without normalization. Comparing 7th vs 8th, again identical. Comparing 9th vs 10th, 9th uses a relative waste and scaling factor within the sigmoid, while 10th appears to apply exponential functions in a less clear manner, possibly leading to instability. Comparing 10th vs 11th & 12th, they are identical.  Comparing 13th vs 14th, 15th and 16th, they are identical, providing std normalization and a constant boost. Comparing 17th vs 18th, they are identical. Comparing 19th vs 20th, they are identical.  The primary difference between the top heuristics lies in the stability induced by pre-defined scaling factors (1st) and normalization (5th, 13th-16th), and how the best-bin boost is implemented. The latter heuristics progressively become more convoluted without demonstrable improvement.  Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 5th, 13th-16th) focus on robust scaling and stabilization, while later versions introduce complexity without clear benefit, and some suffer from being stateful (iteration dependency) or unstable.

**Experience:**

Prioritize stability in bin-packing heuristics. Carefully tuned, constant scaling factors (sigmoid) and normalization of waste often outperform dynamic or overly complex approaches. Avoid introducing statefulness (like iteration numbers) unless demonstrably beneficial. Simplicity and robustness are key.
