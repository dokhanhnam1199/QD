**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 2nd, they are identical, indicating a redundancy. Heuristics 1st/2nd vs 3rd show the introduction of waste normalization, which attempts to improve stability, but the fixed sigmoid scale of 1.0 seems limiting.  Heuristics 3rd vs 4th reveals a slight change in `best_bin_boost` and `sigmoid_scale`, alongside a subtle difference in how the boost is added (+ vs. +=), with 4th showing a more robust approach.

Comparing Heuristics 1st/2nd vs 5th shows the tuning of `sigmoid_scale` and `best_bin_boost`. Heuristics 6th introduces worst-fit penalty and capacity scoring, adding complexity but attempting to balance bin utilization. Heuristics 7th is functionally similar to 5th. 

Heuristics 8th introduces `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` parameters, offering more control over the weighting of different factors but at the cost of increased tuning complexity. Heuristics 9th, 10th, 11th are essentially the same. Heuristics 12th-14th are very similar with minor changes.

Heuristics 15th-17th are nearly duplicates, incorporating utilization factors alongside best and worst fit. Finally, Heuristics 18th-20th focus on waste normalization and attempt to handle cases with zero standard deviation, but lack the diversity promotion strategies of earlier heuristics.  

Overall, the best heuristics (1st/2nd) provide a solid base of best-fit and sigmoid scaling. Introducing diversity (worst-fit) as in 6th and 15th seems beneficial, while normalization (3rd, 18th) is helpful for stability but might require more careful parameter tuning. The redundant entries highlight the need for thorough testing and comparison.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and diversity. Combining best-fit with a mechanism to explore less-obvious (but potentially better) bins, like a slight penalty for best-fit or a reward for worst-fit, boosts performance. Dynamically adjusting priorities based on bin utilization is promising but requires careful parameter tuning. Redundancy should be avoided.
