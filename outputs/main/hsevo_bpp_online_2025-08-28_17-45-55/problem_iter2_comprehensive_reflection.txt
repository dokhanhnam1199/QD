Okay, let's dissect this and build a robust self-reflection framework for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown focused on improving bin packing heuristics:

* **Keywords:** Prioritization, Normalization, Stability, Conciseness.
* **Advice:** Focus priority functions *directly* on remaining bin space *after* item placement. Use sigmoid scaling for priorities â€“ it's robust. Explore item-bin fit ratios *before* complex calculations.
* **Avoid:** Division (prone to instability), overly complex scoring (redundancy), unnormalized scores (outlier sensitivity).
* **Explanation:**  Directly addressing the objective, coupled with stable, normalized prioritization, guides the heuristic efficiently. Simplicity aids understanding and prevents unintended consequences.
