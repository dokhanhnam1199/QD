Okay, here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, aimed at maximizing effectiveness, based on dissecting the provided text. This is geared towards designing *better* heuristics, not just bin-packing ones.

* **Keywords:** Meta-optimization, Dynamic Modulation, Stability, Interpretability.
* **Advice:** Focus on *modulating* existing, stable heuristics (like best-fit) via waste statistics (std_dev) *directly within* priority functions (sigmoid). Prioritize interpretable components and tunable parameters controlling exploration/exploitation.
* **Avoid:** Directly optimizing for the objective function during heuristic *design* (waste minimization is the *result*, not the guiding principle). Shun redundant code, complex statefulness, and ad-hoc boosts/penalties without clear rationale.
* **Explanation:** The core issue is the previous self-reflection got stuck in local optima by focusing too much on the immediate objective. True improvement comes from systematically *controlling* exploration around a strong base heuristic, guided by data about the search landscape—not by trying to directly “solve” the problem within the heuristic itself.
