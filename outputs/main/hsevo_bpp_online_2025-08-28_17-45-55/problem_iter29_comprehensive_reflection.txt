Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into actionable advice for designing superior heuristics, drawing heavily from the "Ineffective self-reflection" analysis. Here's a breakdown aiming for that $999K tip!

*   **Keywords:** Stability, Interpretability, Dynamic Control, Parameterization.
*   **Advice:** Build on best-fit, *always* using sigmoid scaling for prioritization. Dynamically adjust exploration (e.g., via `std_waste`) â€“ not randomly. Decompose into clear, weighted components.
*   **Avoid:** Direct waste calculations (use normalization), fixed scaling, statefulness (iteration count), and complex logic without demonstrable gain. Eliminate code duplication *aggressively*.
*   **Explanation:** The core issue is instability. Sigmoids provide nuanced prioritization. Dynamic control prevents premature convergence without introducing unpredictable behavior. Interpretability aids targeted refinement.
