**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both are sophisticated but the 1st incorporates exploration and diversity more elegantly with adjustable weights, while the 2nd relies on fixed boosts/penalties and a sigmoid scaling that might not generalize well. The 1stâ€™s `exploration_rate` and weighted combination of best-fit and diversity offer a tunable balance.

Comparing 3rd vs 4th, they are identical, indicating redundancy.

Comparing 1st vs 5th, both use exploration and weighted best-fit/diversity, but the 1st has slightly cleaner implementation. The 5th feels like a nearly identical copy.

Comparing 6th vs 7th & 8th, the 6th and 7th/8th use inverse waste but 6th uses a very small constant to avoid division by zero, which is good practice. However, the magnitude of the worst-fit penalty is small (-0.1), and the heuristics are almost the same. 

Comparing 9th vs 10th, these are very similar, only differing in how they handle the `~possible_bins` case. 10th explicitly sets them to zero which is preferred.

Comparing 12th vs 13th & 14th, the 12th and 14th are almost identical. The 13th has a larger best-fit boost.

Comparing 15th vs 16th & 17th, these are similar and the 16th & 17th add exploration. The 16th and 17th are identical.

Comparing 18th, 19th, & 20th, they all utilize weighted components of best-fit, worst-fit, and diversity. They are effectively the same.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 2nd, 16th & 17th) combine multiple factors (best-fit, diversity, exploration) and allow for tunable parameters.  The core idea of combining best-fit with a penalty for the worst-fit bin, and explicitly handling edge cases (no valid bins) is present in many, but the weighting and scaling are crucial.  Explicitly handling cases where no bins are valid is important. Redundancy is present across many of the heuristics. Simpler approaches (like 6th, 7th, 8th) can work reasonably well but lack flexibility.



**Experience:**

Prioritize tunable parameters (weights for components like best-fit, diversity, exploration) to enhance adaptability.  Avoid redundancy. Explicitly handle edge cases. Combining best-fit with a (mild) worst-fit penalty improves performance. Explore dynamic parameter adjustment.
