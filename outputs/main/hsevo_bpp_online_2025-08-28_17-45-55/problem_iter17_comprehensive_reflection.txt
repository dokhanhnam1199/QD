Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, learning *from* the "Ineffective" notes to avoid past pitfalls:

* **Keywords:** Meta-optimization, Balance, Stability, Exploration/Exploitation.
* **Advice:** Focus on *balancing* exploitation (best-fit boosts) with exploration (worst-fit penalties). Prioritize robust, parameter-driven control (like sigmoid scaling) over problem-specific 'cleverness'.
* **Avoid:** Directly optimizing for the *objective* within the heuristic itself. Don't chase immediate waste reduction; prioritize stable, diverse search. Resist dynamic adjustments *without* thorough testing.
* **Explanation:** The "Ineffective" reflections overly focused on bin-packing specifics & direct optimization, causing instability. True improvement comes from controlling the *search process*, not micro-managing bin choices.
