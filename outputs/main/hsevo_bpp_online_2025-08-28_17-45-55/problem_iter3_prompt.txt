Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    return priorities\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        best_bin_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item)\n        priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0\n        priorities[np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0][best_bin_index]] = 2.0\n    else:\n        priorities[:] = 0.0\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's dissect this and build a robust self-reflection framework for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown focused on improving bin packing heuristics:\n\n* **Keywords:** Prioritization, Normalization, Stability, Conciseness.\n* **Advice:** Focus priority functions *directly* on remaining bin space *after* item placement. Use sigmoid scaling for priorities \u2013 it's robust. Explore item-bin fit ratios *before* complex calculations.\n* **Avoid:** Division (prone to instability), overly complex scoring (redundancy), unnormalized scores (outlier sensitivity).\n* **Explanation:**  Directly addressing the objective, coupled with stable, normalized prioritization, guides the heuristic efficiently. Simplicity aids understanding and prevents unintended consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
