Okay, let's craft a redefined 'Current Self-Reflection' for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, stepping through the analysis of the provided texts:

**Step 1: Identify Core Conflict:** The "Current" & "Ineffective" reflections *appear* to want the same things (stability, sigmoid scaling, normalization). The difference lies in *where* to apply them. "Ineffective" focuses on the *objective function* directly, while "Current" prioritizes stability *in the heuristic itself*. This is crucial – stable heuristic behavior allows for better exploration.

**Step 2: Extract Principles:** The "Current" reflection's success suggests robustness comes from predictable behavior, even if it means a slight compromise on immediate objective optimization. "Ineffective"’s pitfalls stem from sensitivity.

**Step 3: Redefine for Heuristic Design:**

*   **Keywords:** Robustness, Predictability, Controlled Exploration, Scalability.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize *heuristic mechanism* stability. Employ sigmoid scaling & normalization not to directly *optimize* waste *within* a step, but to *regulate* the heuristic's choices *between* steps.
*   **Avoid:** Directly encoding objective function values into heuristic selection *without* strong smoothing and stability controls. Overly aggressive/dynamic adjustments based on immediate results.
*   **Explanation:** A stable heuristic offers consistent search behavior. Sigmoids provide controlled selection pressure. This facilitates broader exploration and avoids getting stuck in locally optimal, yet fragile, solutions.
