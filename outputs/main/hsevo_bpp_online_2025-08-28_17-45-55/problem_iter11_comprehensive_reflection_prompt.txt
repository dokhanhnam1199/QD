{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize numerical stability in bin packing heuristics. Normalizing waste based on mean and standard deviation generally outperforms simple reciprocal or relative waste calculations.  Adjustable parameters enable fine-tuning and broader applicability.  Ensure code redundancy is minimized during evaluations.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize solutions that directly address the bin packing objective (minimizing waste). Avoid unstable operations (division by small numbers). A smooth, normalized priority function (like a sigmoid) can improve performance. Keep the code concise and avoid redundancy. Normalize scores carefully and consider the impact of outliers.\n\nPrioritize best-fit heuristics *with* sigmoid scaling for stability. Standardizing the input to the sigmoid (e.g., using standard deviation) can improve performance. A small 'best bin boost' can prevent premature convergence. Carefully tune sigmoid parameters to suit the specific problem. Avoid direct division without safeguards.\n\nPrioritize stability in bin-packing heuristics. Carefully tuned, constant scaling factors (sigmoid) and normalization of waste often outperform dynamic or overly complex approaches. Avoid introducing statefulness (like iteration numbers) unless demonstrably beneficial. Simplicity and robustness are key.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
