{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize best-fit as the foundation. Exploration is key, but should be dynamic and controlled (e.g., sigmoid scaling of waste, or factors based on bin statistics) rather than fixed or purely random. Avoid code duplication.  Focus on interpretable components\u2014the influence of each part of the heuristic should be clear.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize solutions that directly address the bin packing objective (minimizing waste). Avoid unstable operations (division by small numbers). A smooth, normalized priority function (like a sigmoid) can improve performance. Keep the code concise and avoid redundancy. Normalize scores carefully and consider the impact of outliers.\n\nPrioritize best-fit heuristics *with* sigmoid scaling for stability. Standardizing the input to the sigmoid (e.g., using standard deviation) can improve performance. A small 'best bin boost' can prevent premature convergence. Carefully tune sigmoid parameters to suit the specific problem. Avoid direct division without safeguards.\n\nPrioritize stability in bin-packing heuristics. Carefully tuned, constant scaling factors (sigmoid) and normalization of waste often outperform dynamic or overly complex approaches. Avoid introducing statefulness (like iteration numbers) unless demonstrably beneficial. Simplicity and robustness are key.\n\nPrioritize numerical stability in bin packing heuristics. Normalizing waste based on mean and standard deviation generally outperforms simple reciprocal or relative waste calculations.  Adjustable parameters enable fine-tuning and broader applicability.  Ensure code redundancy is minimized during evaluations.\n\nPrioritize simplicity and diversity. Combining best-fit with a mechanism to explore less-obvious (but potentially better) bins, like a slight penalty for best-fit or a reward for worst-fit, boosts performance. Dynamically adjusting priorities based on bin utilization is promising but requires careful parameter tuning. Redundancy should be avoided.\n\nPrioritize stability. Sigmoid scaling significantly improves performance by preventing priority dominance. Small, targeted boosts to best-fit *and* penalties to worst-fit balance efficiency and diversity. Avoid simple subtraction for penalties as it may lead to undesirable negative priority values. Parameter tuning, like the sigmoid scale, is crucial for optimal behavior.\n\nPrioritize sigmoid scaling for stable, nuanced prioritization. Explicitly handle edge cases. Small, carefully tuned worst-fit penalties improve diversity. Avoid large boost/penalty values. Redundancy should be avoided and thoroughly tested. The optimal balance between best-fit and diversity is key.\n\nPrioritize tunable parameters (weights for components like best-fit, diversity, exploration) to enhance adaptability.  Avoid redundancy. Explicitly handle edge cases. Combining best-fit with a (mild) worst-fit penalty improves performance. Explore dynamic parameter adjustment.\n\nPrioritize simplicity and stability in base heuristics (best-fit). Dynamically scaling based on waste statistics (`std_waste`) or a time-dependent factor can improve performance.  Exploration should be balanced and, when implemented, modulated based on bin state. Avoid unnecessary complexity unless it demonstrably improves performance. Code duplication should be addressed, as it hinders analysis and suggests a flawed ranking process.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
