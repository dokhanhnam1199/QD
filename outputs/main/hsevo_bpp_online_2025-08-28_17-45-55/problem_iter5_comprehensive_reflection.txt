Okay, let's refine this heuristic design approach! Here’s a breakdown focusing on maximizing effectiveness and avoiding pitfalls, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Sigmoid Scaling, Stability, Exploration, Parameter Tuning.
* **Advice:** Focus on *relative* heuristic fitness (sigmoid output) – not absolute objective function improvement. Experiment with multiple sigmoid parameters (k, x0) tailored to problem scale. Implement a decaying 'best bin boost' over iterations.
* **Avoid:** Directly optimizing for the bin packing objective *within* the heuristic priority. Over-reliance on normalization without outlier handling.
* **Explanation:** Sigmoids provide stable, differentiable prioritization.  The boost prevents stagnation, while tuning adapts to problem characteristics. Prioritizing heuristic quality *guides* search, rather than directly solving, leading to better exploration.
