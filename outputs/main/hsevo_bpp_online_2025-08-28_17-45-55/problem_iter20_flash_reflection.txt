**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd), they are identical. This suggests redundancy and an initial lack of clear differentiation. Examining (1st) vs (4th), (5th), (6th), the core logic remains similar but the boosts/penalties are removed and replaced by a simpler inverse waste calculation with a small penalty. (4th)-(6th) are identical. 

Comparing (4th) vs (7th) and (8th) reveals the addition of a return statement for the case where no valid bins exist – a minor but crucial improvement for robustness. (7th) and (8th) are identical.

(7th)/(8th) vs (9th), the difference is a penalty added to the best bin in (7th)/(8th) instead of subtracted from worst.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), (11th), (12th), (13th), (14th) shows a progression from simpler penalty to sigmoid scaling and more defined boost/penalty values. (10th)-(14th) are very similar with minor changes to boost/penalty.

(14th) vs (15th), (16th), (17th), (18th), (19th) and (20th) shows a shift in focus - handling cases with no possible bins explicitly and a refined approach of adding boosts and penalties to the best/worst bins, with sigmoid scaling introduced in the later versions. (15th), (17th), (19th) are identical and (16th), (18th), (20th) are identical.

Overall: The best heuristics consistently combine best-fit (waste minimization, often with sigmoid scaling for stability) with a mild worst-fit penalty to promote bin diversity. Explicitly handling edge cases (no valid bins) is vital. The magnitude of boosts and penalties is critical; excessive values (like in the 1st-3rd heuristics) don’t significantly improve performance over simpler methods.

**Experience:**

Prioritize sigmoid scaling for stable, nuanced prioritization. Explicitly handle edge cases. Small, carefully tuned worst-fit penalties improve diversity. Avoid large boost/penalty values. Redundancy should be avoided and thoroughly tested. The optimal balance between best-fit and diversity is key.
