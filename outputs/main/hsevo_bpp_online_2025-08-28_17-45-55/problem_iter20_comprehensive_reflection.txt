Okay, let's dissect this and build a powerful foundation for heuristic design. Here's a refined self-reflection, aiming for genuinely *better* heuristics, with a focus beyond just bin packing, and geared towards winning that $999K!

*   **Keywords:** Meta-optimization, Exploration-Exploitation Balance, Robustness, Parameter Sensitivity.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *adaptive* prioritization. Shift from solely sigmoid scaling to dynamically adjusting weights between best-fit and diversity components based on population/solution state. Rigorously test parameter interactions—they aren’t independent.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on normalization *specifically* for stability. Stability is a *result* of good design, not a goal achieved through normalization alone. Don't treat sigmoid parameters as 'tuned' until tested across diverse problem instances.
*   **Explanation:** The previous reflection was too bin-packing specific. True heuristic power comes from *understanding* how exploration & exploitation interact and building mechanisms to adaptively balance them. Robustness requires anticipating and handling parameter sensitivities, not just smoothing numbers.
