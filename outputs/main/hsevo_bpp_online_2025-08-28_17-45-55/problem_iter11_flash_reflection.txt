**Analysis:**

Comparing the top-ranked heuristics (1st-3rd) with the bottom-ranked (18th-20th), the primary difference lies in the thoroughness of handling edge cases and the stability of the calculations. The best heuristics consistently check `np.any(valid_bins)` to avoid errors when no bins are suitable for the current item.  They also include `small_value` or `1e-6` to prevent division by zero, crucial for numerical stability.  The best consistently use the `sigmoid_scale` and `best_bin_boost` to tune bin preference.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd) and (1st) vs (3rd), we find the code is literally identical.
Comparing (2nd) vs (4th) similarly shows identical code. This suggests the ranking is somewhat arbitrary.
Comparing (5th) vs (6th), (5th) normalizes the waste using mean and standard deviation before applying the sigmoid, improving bin selection, whereas (6th) uses a simple reciprocal of waste and a fixed sigmoid scaling. (5th) is better.
Comparing (7th) vs (8th), (7th) normalizes waste using the standard deviation while (8th) uses relative waste which can be unstable if `np.max(waste)` is close to zero. (7th) is better.
Comparing (9th) vs (10th), (9th) normalizes with mean and standard deviation and uses a boost factor while (10th) uses a simple reciprocal, then applies sigmoid. (9th) is better.
Comparing (11th) vs (12th), they’re nearly identical, differing only in minor whitespace and potential execution order.
Comparing (13th) vs (16th), they’re identical.
Comparing (14th) vs (15th) and (17th) vs (18th), there's no code inside function, so they are the worst.
Comparing (19th) vs (20th), they’re identical.

Overall: The most effective heuristics prioritize numerical stability by avoiding division by zero, using normalization to prevent extreme values from dominating, and incorporating adjustable parameters (sigmoid scale, boost factor) to fine-tune performance. The redundant code suggests the initial ranking might not fully reflect underlying differences.



**Experience:**

Prioritize numerical stability in bin packing heuristics. Normalizing waste based on mean and standard deviation generally outperforms simple reciprocal or relative waste calculations.  Adjustable parameters enable fine-tuning and broader applicability.  Ensure code redundancy is minimized during evaluations.
