**Analysis:**

Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, they are identical. This suggests redundancy; one could be removed. Comparing the 1st (and 2nd) to the 3rd, 4th, 5th heuristics, the latter introduce a `time_step` based exploration bonus. While exploration is good, these implementations are identical to each other.  Comparing the 3rd/4th/5th to the 6th, we see a shift to using `exploration_factor_min` and `exploration_factor_max` which is a more controlled exploration approach. However, the 6th heuristic is incomplete. The 7th, 8th and 9th heuristics are identical and explore a dynamic exploration based on waste statistics (average and standard deviation) with a sigmoid scaling. The 10th and 11th are identical and blend best-fit with a bin usage diversity component, showing a focus on load balancing. Heuristics 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th show similar patterns like sigmoid scaling and exploration/penalty components, yet contain duplicate code. The 20th heuristic combines best-fit, a worst-fit penalty and random exploration.  The most consistent successful pattern is the combination of best-fit with some form of controlled exploration (sigmoid scaling or dynamic factors). Penalizing worst-fit bins appears less consistently effective.

**Experience:**

Prioritize best-fit as the foundation. Exploration is key, but should be dynamic and controlled (e.g., sigmoid scaling of waste, or factors based on bin statistics) rather than fixed or purely random. Avoid code duplication.  Focus on interpretable componentsâ€”the influence of each part of the heuristic should be clear.
