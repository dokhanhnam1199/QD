**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both are nearly identical, employing best-fit with sigmoid scaling. However, the 1st has pre-tuned `sigmoid_scale` and `best_bin_boost` while the 2nd uses default values, suggesting parameter tuning is critical. Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), the 3rd normalizes waste before sigmoid scaling, which can improve stability across different bin sizes, but uses a fixed boost. (3rd) vs (4th): these are identical, highlighting redundancy. Comparing (1st) vs (6th), 6th introduces `waste_std` modulation, potentially adding adaptability, and a larger `best_bin_boost`, but introduces potential instability. (6th) vs (7th): 7th uses normalized waste and average waste. (7th) vs (8th): again identical. (7th) vs (9th): 9th uses squared waste standard deviation in modulation, potentially amplifying the effect of variance. (9th) vs (10th): 10th uses a simpler normalization and a small boost. Comparing (11th) to (12th), both use similar modulation, but (12th) adds `waste_std` directly to the sigmoid input, potentially causing overflow. (13th) and (14th) have lower exploration factor. (14th) and (15th) through (20th) introduce more variability in the exploration bonus, aiming to adjust exploration dynamically, but often with smaller, less impactful bonuses. Overall, the best heuristics (1st-6th) demonstrate the value of combining best-fit with well-tuned sigmoid scaling and exploration based on waste statistics. The later heuristics suffer from either redundant code, smaller exploration values, or instability with sigmoid scaling.

**Experience:**

Prioritize parameter tuning (sigmoid scale, boost) alongside waste statistics integration.  Dynamic exploration, modulated by waste standard deviation, improves adaptability, but requires careful scaling to avoid overshadowing best-fit.  Avoid redundancy and potential numerical instability in sigmoid input.
