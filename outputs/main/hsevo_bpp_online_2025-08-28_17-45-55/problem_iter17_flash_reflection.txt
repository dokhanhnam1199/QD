**Analysis:**

Comparing Heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the 1st utilizes a sigmoid scaling on waste *and* a boost for the best bin, introducing parameters tuned for stability. The 2nd relies solely on inverse waste and a simple boost/penalty, lacking the smoothing effect of the sigmoid.  Comparing Heuristics 2nd vs 3rd, 4th, 5th, they are identical.

Comparing 1st vs 6th, the 1st's sigmoid is a key difference, stabilizing priority scores and preventing extreme values. 6th uses a simple inverse waste, which can be sensitive. Comparing 6th vs 7th, 8th, 9th, they are identical.

Comparing 6th vs 10th, 10th adds a penalty to the *worst* bin, intended to promote diversity. But subtracting a constant value may not be as effective as the sigmoid scaling, and can cause negative priorities.  11th through 13th are very similar, focusing on best-fit with a mild worst-fit penalty. 14th & 15th introduce sigmoid scaling to both best and worst bins, and a penalty for worst bin. 16th & 17th use a smaller worst fit penalty. 18th, 19th and 20th combine best fit and a worst fit penalty.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st) intelligently combines best-fit with techniques to stabilize the priority scores and to prevent extreme values by scaling and boosting. The worst heuristics (20th) rely on simple inverse waste and lack the stabilizing features seen in the best, as well as lack of a smoothing effect.  The repeated heuristics contribute nothing to comparative insight.

**Experience:**

Prioritize stability. Sigmoid scaling significantly improves performance by preventing priority dominance. Small, targeted boosts to best-fit *and* penalties to worst-fit balance efficiency and diversity. Avoid simple subtraction for penalties as it may lead to undesirable negative priority values. Parameter tuning, like the sigmoid scale, is crucial for optimal behavior.
