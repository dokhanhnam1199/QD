{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize best-fit heuristics *with* sigmoid scaling for stability. Standardizing the input to the sigmoid (e.g., using standard deviation) can improve performance. A small 'best bin boost' can prevent premature convergence. Carefully tune sigmoid parameters to suit the specific problem. Avoid direct division without safeguards.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize solutions that directly address the bin packing objective (minimizing waste). Avoid unstable operations (division by small numbers). A smooth, normalized priority function (like a sigmoid) can improve performance. Keep the code concise and avoid redundancy. Normalize scores carefully and consider the impact of outliers.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
