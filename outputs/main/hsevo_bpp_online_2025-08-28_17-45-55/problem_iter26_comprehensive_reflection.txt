Okay, let's distill this extensive self-reflection into actionable advice for designing better heuristics, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Stability, Simplicity, Tunability, Diversity.
* **Advice:** Prioritize a robust, simple 'best-fit' core. Introduce *controlled* diversity via small, tunable penalties/rewards to non-best bins. Dynamically adjust exploration *based on bin state*, not just time/waste.
* **Avoid:** Complex scaling (beyond sigmoid), aggressive dynamic adjustments, direct division, and code duplication. Over-reliance on normalization *as a primary driver* instead of underlying logic.
* **Explanation:** The repeated emphasis across the "ineffective" reflections points to instability and over-fitting. A solid, predictable core (best-fit + sigmoid) provides a foundation. Tunable parameters allow adaptation without sacrificing robustness.
