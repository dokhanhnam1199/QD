**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe identical code. This is unusual for a ranked list.  (1st/2nd) vs (3rd), the key difference is the 3rd heuristic introduces dynamic scaling with `std_waste`, exploration with `exploration_boost`, and relies on more complex statistical calculations (mean, std). (3rd) vs (4th), the 4th is simpler, using a time-dependent exploration bonus instead of standard deviation based exploration. (4th) vs (5th), the 5th adds worst-fit consideration and a more complex exploration factor dependent on average remaining capacity. (5th) vs (6th/7th), all three are identical, again suggesting an issue with the ranking. (6th/7th) vs (8th/9th) again identical and those use a simpler best-fit with a worst-fit penalty.  (8th/9th) vs (10th), the 10th uses a combination of best-fit, diversity (bin usage), and exploration, which is more complex. (10th) vs (11th), they are identical. (11th) vs (12th), the 12th simplifies back to a time-dependent exploration bonus. (12th) vs (13th/14th), all three are identical again. (13th/14th) vs (15th/16th), identical. (15th/16th) vs (17th/18th), identical.  (17th/18th) vs (19th), identical. (19th) vs (20th), the 20th incorporates both best-fit, worst-fit, and exploration, with a random component to the exploration boost.

Overall: The initial rankings are questionable due to numerous code duplicates. Generally, the better heuristics (1st-4th) focus on a stable best-fit approach potentially combined with dynamic adjustments. Heuristics (5th-20th) introduce increasing complexity with worst-fit penalties, diversity components and exploration, often with little demonstrated improvement. The use of `np.exp` with a scaling factor is consistently beneficial. Exploration, when used, seems more effective when dynamically adjusted based on bin usage/waste.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and stability in base heuristics (best-fit). Dynamically scaling based on waste statistics (`std_waste`) or a time-dependent factor can improve performance.  Exploration should be balanced and, when implemented, modulated based on bin state. Avoid unnecessary complexity unless it demonstrably improves performance. Code duplication should be addressed, as it hinders analysis and suggests a flawed ranking process.
