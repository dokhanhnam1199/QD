**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the primary difference is the `sigmoid_scale` (1.0 vs 5.0) and how exploration is handled. Heuristic 1st uses a `best_bin_boost` *after* applying the sigmoid, while 2nd modulates the sigmoid itself with an `exploration_factor` based on waste standard deviation. Both 2nd, 3rd, 4th are identical. 

Comparing 1st vs 5th, 5th includes more detailed documentation, but functionally, they are quite similar. Heuristic 1st applies the boost after the sigmoid, whereas 5th applies the boost at the very end.

Heuristics 6th is significantly different introducing potentially unnecessary imports (torch, scipy, math, random), while being functionally similar to the top heuristics.

Heuristics 7th modifies the sigmoid input, adding `waste_std`, which can disproportionately influence the sigmoid's output and potentially hinder exploration, showing poorer performance.

Heuristics 8th-10th introduce a random exploration boost, which, while attempting diversity, doesn’t adapt well to the problem's structure. The scaling of this boost (`0.1 * (1 + avg_waste/item)`) could lead to very large boosts when `avg_waste` is high.

Heuristics 11th-13th adds a diversity component (bin usage), which isn’t directly related to the immediate packing decision and could distract from waste minimization.

Heuristics 14th-15th: The exploration bonus is scaled by `std_waste / (avg_waste + 1e-6)`, which is prone to instability if `avg_waste` is close to zero. 

Heuristics 16th-20th improve stability by using `np.maximum(0.1, std_waste)` for the exploration factor. However, these heuristics seem to overemphasize the exploration factor. The constant sigmoid scale of 2.0 is a potential issue.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st and 5th) effectively balance best-fit with a small, targeted boost to the best bin. The exploration mechanisms in later heuristics introduce unnecessary complexity or instability, making them less effective. The key is to minimize waste first and then selectively encourage exploration to avoid getting stuck in local optima. Modulating the sigmoid function directly with a calculated factor appears more effective than simply adding a constant boost.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and stability. Direct modulation of the sigmoid function based on waste statistics is superior to adding random or highly variable exploration boosts. A consistent, focused best-fit approach with a minimal, well-controlled exploration factor yields better performance. Avoid unnecessary imports.
