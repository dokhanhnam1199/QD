### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

I'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize solutions that directly address the bin packing objective (minimizing waste). Avoid unstable operations (division by small numbers). A smooth, normalized priority function (like a sigmoid) can improve performance. Keep the code concise and avoid redundancy. Normalize scores carefully and consider the impact of outliers.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.any(valid_bins):
        best_bin_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item)
        priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0
        priorities[best_bin_index] = 2.0
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap[bins_remain_cap >= item]
    if len(possible_bins) == 0:
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    scores = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(possible_bins - item) / (np.std(bins_remain_cap) + 1e-6)))
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    bin_indices = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0]
    
    for i, index in enumerate(bin_indices):
        priorities[index] = scores[i]
    
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing `priority_v2` from the best (1st) vs. the worst (20th) heuristics, the key difference lies in how priority is assigned. The best version intelligently prioritizes bins by minimizing waste (`np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item)` and assigning a higher priority to the best fit). The worst, and many subsequent versions, simply use `bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item` directly, which doesn't account for the overall goal of minimizing wasted space.

Comparing the 1st vs. 2nd, they are identical, showcasing an initial lack of variation. From 3rd-4th, there is a shift towards calculating waste, but the 3rd uses `np.where` unnecessarily making it slightly less efficient. Between 4th and 5th, there’s again identical code, suggesting redundancy.  The 6th introduces a `fit_level` representing item size relative to remaining capacity, which is a good concept. 7th attempts an exponential weighting, but normalizes by the sum of fit scores, adding complexity without clear benefit. 8th uses a raw ratio of remaining space to capacity.

The 9th-10th introduces a sigmoid function (1 / (1 + exp(-x))), attempting a smoother priority distribution, coupled with `np.std` for normalization. This is a solid improvement, but relies on the standard deviation, potentially being sensitive to outliers.  Heuristics 11th-13th use the inverse of remaining space (`1 / (bins_remain_cap - item)`). This amplifies differences but can become unstable when the remaining space is very small (division by a small number). 14th-17th use `bins_remain_cap - item` but assign -1 for invalid bins, which isn’t helpful. Finally, 18th-20th revert to the basic waste calculation.

Overall: The best heuristics focus on *minimizing waste*, either directly or through a smooth function. Using inverse waste creates potential instability. The best solutions avoid unnecessary code or complexity and prioritize bins with the least wasted space. The consistent issue across the lower-ranked heuristics is the lack of nuance in prioritizing bins beyond simple feasibility.

Okay, let's dissect this and build a robust self-reflection framework for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown focused on improving bin packing heuristics:

* **Keywords:** Prioritization, Normalization, Stability, Conciseness.
* **Advice:** Focus priority functions *directly* on remaining bin space *after* item placement. Use sigmoid scaling for priorities – it's robust. Explore item-bin fit ratios *before* complex calculations.
* **Avoid:** Division (prone to instability), overly complex scoring (redundancy), unnormalized scores (outlier sensitivity).
* **Explanation:**  Directly addressing the objective, coupled with stable, normalized prioritization, guides the heuristic efficiently. Simplicity aids understanding and prevents unintended consequences.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.any(valid_bins):
        best_bin_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item)
        priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0
        priorities[np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0][best_bin_index]] = 2.0
    else:
        priorities[:] = 0.0
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:

Okay, let's dissect this and build a robust self-reflection framework for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown focused on improving bin packing heuristics:

* **Keywords:** Prioritization, Normalization, Stability, Conciseness.
* **Advice:** Focus priority functions *directly* on remaining bin space *after* item placement. Use sigmoid scaling for priorities – it's robust. Explore item-bin fit ratios *before* complex calculations.
* **Avoid:** Division (prone to instability), overly complex scoring (redundancy), unnormalized scores (outlier sensitivity).
* **Explanation:**  Directly addressing the objective, coupled with stable, normalized prioritization, guides the heuristic efficiently. Simplicity aids understanding and prevents unintended consequences.





Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Combines best-fit (waste minimization) with sigmoid scaling for stability."""
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

        sigmoid_scaled_waste = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-waste))
        priorities[valid_bins] = sigmoid_scaled_waste
        priorities[np.where(valid_bins)[0][best_bin_index]] = 2.0
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
