Okay, let's refine this self-reflection for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, focusing on actionable improvements:

* **Keywords:** Meta-optimization, Robustness, Parameter Sensitivity, Statistical Control.
* **Advice:** Focus on *systematically* exploring parameter spaces (adjustable parameters are good, but need structured testing – Design of Experiments!). Prioritize methods quantifying heuristic performance *variation* across datasets, not just averages.
* **Avoid:** Prematurely focusing on specific heuristics (best-fit/sigmoid). The goal isn't *that* solution, it’s *understanding why* some approaches are more adaptable. Avoid over-reliance on single normalization techniques.
* **Explanation:** The prior reflection drifted into solution-specific tuning. Truly effective self-reflection identifies *principles* of robust design. Numerical stability is vital, but it's a symptom of good meta-optimization—understanding parameter interactions and data sensitivity—not the sole focus.
