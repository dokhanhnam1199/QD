Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Combines best-fit (waste minimization) with sigmoid scaling for stability.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        waste = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n        best_bin_index = np.argmin(waste)\n        sigmoid_scaled_waste = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-waste * sigmoid_scale))\n        priorities[valid_bins] = sigmoid_scaled_waste\n        priorities[np.where(valid_bins)[0][best_bin_index]] = best_bin_boost\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's distill this extensive self-reflection into actionable advice for designing better heuristics, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords:** Stability, Simplicity, Tunability, Diversity.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize a robust, simple 'best-fit' core. Introduce *controlled* diversity via small, tunable penalties/rewards to non-best bins. Dynamically adjust exploration *based on bin state*, not just time/waste.\n* **Avoid:** Complex scaling (beyond sigmoid), aggressive dynamic adjustments, direct division, and code duplication. Over-reliance on normalization *as a primary driver* instead of underlying logic.\n* **Explanation:** The repeated emphasis across the \"ineffective\" reflections points to instability and over-fitting. A solid, predictable core (best-fit + sigmoid) provides a foundation. Tunable parameters allow adaptation without sacrificing robustness.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
