**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd), (4th): These are identical functions. They all combine best-fit with sigmoid scaling and a 'best bin boost'. This approach is generally sound, prioritizing both minimal waste and some exploration to avoid getting stuck in local optima. The constants (2.5369418572825637 and 1.704707830932726) likely result from parameter tuning.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), (7th), (8th):  (5th) and (7th) are identical, and (6th) and (8th) are identical. The primary difference is the 'best bin boost'. (5th)/(7th) do not boost any bin and simply scale waste, while (6th)/(8th) boost the best bin with a value of 2.0. The sigmoid scaling in (5th) and (7th) is applied directly to the priority, but uses a basic `1e-9` to prevent division by zero.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), (11th), (12th):  (9th) is similar to (5th) and (7th) but more concise. (10th) and (12th) are simpler, only using a sigmoid on the waste. (11th) and (13th) and (15th) are identical, standardizing the waste using `np.std`, which can improve scaling. (11th), (13th) and (15th) also include a 'best bin boost' of 2.0. 

Comparing (14th) vs (16th): (14th) uses a different sigmoid input (based on `1 - fit_levels`), while (16th) normalizes fit scores before applying the sigmoid. Normalizing via `max_fit` in (16th) is a good practice for ensuring stable sigmoid input values.

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), (19th), (20th): (17th) and (12th) are identical. (18th), (19th), and (20th) are identical, using fit ratios and exponentiation, with a 'best bin boost'.

Overall: The best heuristics consistently combine best-fit (waste minimization) with a sigmoid scaling function for stability and the standardisation of waste using the standard deviation of the bins, with the addition of a best bin boost to avoid early sub-optimisation. The most problematic heuristics are those that lack sigmoid scaling, rely on potentially unstable division, or donâ€™t normalise/standardise the data.  The constants seem tuned, hinting that finding appropriate parameters is crucial.

**Experience:**

Prioritize best-fit heuristics *with* sigmoid scaling for stability. Standardizing the input to the sigmoid (e.g., using standard deviation) can improve performance. A small 'best bin boost' can prevent premature convergence. Carefully tune sigmoid parameters to suit the specific problem. Avoid direct division without safeguards.
