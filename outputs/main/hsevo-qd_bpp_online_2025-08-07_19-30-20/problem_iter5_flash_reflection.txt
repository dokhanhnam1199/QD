**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic uses weighted random choice to favor tight fits, adding a random factor for tie‑breaking, whereas the worst uses a deterministic worst‑fit strategy that often leads to poor bin utilisation. (second best) vs (second worst), we see the second best matches the best in simplicity and performance, while the second worst introduces a hybrid sigmoid‑based weighting and random perturbation that unnecessarily increases complexity without clear benefit. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the implementations are identical, highlighting code duplication. (3rd) vs (4th), we see another identical weighted‑random implementation, further indicating redundancy. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst improves upon the worst‑fit by incorporating a weighted sigmoid and stochastic component, leading to better bin utilisation. Overall, the ranking reflects a trade‑off between simplicity, randomness, and computational overhead, with the top heuristics delivering robust packing through lightweight randomised weighting, while the bottom ones either over‑engineer or oversimplify the problem.

**Experience:**
Weighted randomization with 1/(remaining) offers a robust, low‑overhead strategy. Softmax or sigmoid layers add marginal gains at the cost of complexity. Avoid duplicate implementations; document clearly; keep code lean. Introduce randomness to break ties, calibrate weighting to prioritize tight fits, and benchmark to confirm improvements.
