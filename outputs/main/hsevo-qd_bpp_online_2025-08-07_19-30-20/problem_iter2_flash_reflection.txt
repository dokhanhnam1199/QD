**Analysis:**  
- **(best) vs (worst):** *Heuristic 1* uses a random weighted score `1/(remaining+ε)` and masks infeasible bins with `-inf`, encouraging tight fits while preserving diversity. *Heuristic 20* simply returns the bin’s remaining capacity for feasible bins (worst‑fit) and `-inf` otherwise, deterministically choosing the most empty bin – a strategy that typically degrades packing quality.  
- **(second best) vs (second worst):** *Heuristic 2* is identical to 1, while *Heuristic 19* mirrors 20; the same conclusions apply.  
- **(1st) vs (2nd):** Both functions are byte‑for‑byte copies; the ranking difference likely reflects perceived robustness rather than functional change.  
- **(3rd) vs (4th):** Again identical code; no observable distinction.  
- **(second worst) vs (worst):** *Heuristic 19* and *Heuristic 20* are identical implementations, showing the list contains duplicate entries.  

*Intermediate observations*:  
- *Heuristic 8* applies a sigmoid on normalized residuals, offering a smooth deterministic bias toward tighter fits.  
- *Heuristics 9‑12* use a simple linear negative leftover (`- (capacity‑item)`) with `-inf` masking, a deterministic best‑fit approach.  
- *Heuristics 13‑15* compute a softmax over `-residual`, yielding probabilistic selection with proper numeric stabilization (`max_raw` subtraction).  
- *Heuristic 16* repeats the linear negative leftover with `-inf` masking.  
- *Heuristic 17* uses a logistic function on normalized leftover, introducing tunable thresholds (`thresh`, `scale`).  
- *Heuristics 18‑20* adopt a worst‑fit policy, directly favoring bins with the most free space.  

Overall, the top‑ranked heuristics blend stochasticity with a bias toward tight packing and robust infeasibility handling; mid‑ranked methods progressively shift toward deterministic or smoother probabilistic schemes; the lowest rank adopts a counter‑productive worst‑fit strategy.

**Experience:**  
Prefer stochastic, tight‑fit bias with explicit `-inf` masking for infeasible bins; use stable numeric tricks (ε, max subtraction) and smooth transforms (sigmoid/softmax) for controlled randomness. Avoid deterministic worst‑fit. Document intent clearly.
