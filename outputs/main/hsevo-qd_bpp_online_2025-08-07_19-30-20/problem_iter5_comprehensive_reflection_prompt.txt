{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWeighted randomization with 1/(remaining) offers a robust, low\u2011overhead strategy. Softmax or sigmoid layers add marginal gains at the cost of complexity. Avoid duplicate implementations; document clearly; keep code lean. Introduce randomness to break ties, calibrate weighting to prioritize tight fits, and benchmark to confirm improvements.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrefer stochastic, tight\u2011fit bias with explicit `-inf` masking for infeasible bins; use stable numeric tricks (\u03b5, max subtraction) and smooth transforms (sigmoid/softmax) for controlled randomness. Avoid deterministic worst\u2011fit. Document intent clearly.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
