**Analysis:**  

- **(1st) vs (20th)** – The top heuristic uses a clean *inverse‑remaining‑capacity* weight multiplied by a uniform random factor, and explicitly marks infeasible bins with `-inf`. The worst heuristic adds a tiny capacity‑bonus and jitter to the same inverse weight, but returns **0** for infeasible bins and mixes additive terms (`weight + bias + jitter`). This can blur the ordering of feasible bins and fails to exploit the sentinel `-inf` that many bin‑packing selectors rely on.  

- **(2nd) vs (19th)** – Identical to the above comparison: the second‑best mirrors the first, while the second‑worst repeats the additive‑bias design of the 20th, confirming that the extra bias/jitter does not improve performance.  

- **(3rd) vs (18th)** – The third heuristic introduces configurable parameters (`weight`, `eps`, `min_priority`) and retains the multiplicative random weighting, preserving a monotonic relationship between residual size and priority. The eighteenth heuristic (same as 17th–20th) again mixes additive bias and jitter, lacking the configurable control and yielding noisier rankings.  

- **(1st) vs (2nd)** – Both are identical implementations; their joint top rank suggests that the baseline weighted‑random approach is already optimal among the candidates, and any duplication does not affect the ordering.  

- **(3rd) vs (4th)** – The fourth heuristic enriches the priority with a *bias toward larger bins*, a variance‑scaled jitter, and an extra random factor. While conceptually richer, the extra terms dilute the primary inverse‑capacity signal and introduce unnecessary stochasticity, causing it to fall below the simpler, parameter‑tuned third heuristic.  

- **(19th) vs (20th)** – These two are duplicates; both suffer from the same additive‑bias issue and share the same low rank, confirming that the additive formulation is consistently inferior.  

- **(Overall)** – The best heuristics favor **multiplicative** combinations of a clear monotonic weight (inverse residual) with modest randomness and proper handling of infeasibility (`-inf`). Heuristics that **add** extra terms (bias, jitter) or replace `-inf` with zero degrade performance, especially when the added components are not carefully scaled. Simplicity, monotonicity, and explicit infeasibility markers emerge as the dominant design principles.  

**Experience:**  
Prefer multiplicative, monotonic weightings (e.g., 1/(remaining+ε)) with light random perturbation; avoid additive bias/jitter and ensure infeasible bins are marked with ‑∞ for robust selection. Simpler, well‑scaled randomness outperforms overly complex, noisy designs.
