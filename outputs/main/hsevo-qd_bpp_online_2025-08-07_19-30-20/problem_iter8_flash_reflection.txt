**Analysis:**  

- **Comparing (best) vs (worst):** The best heuristic (1st) combines an inverse‑residual weight, a tiny capacity‑bias, and a small random jitter, then normalises the result into a probability distribution. It explicitly zeroes out infeasible bins and never returns `‑inf`. The worst heuristic (20th) simply returns the raw remaining capacity for feasible bins (worst‑fit) and `‑inf` otherwise – it ignores how tightly the item fits and provides no stochastic tie‑breaking.  

- **(Second best) vs (second worst):** The 2nd heuristic uses pure inverse‑remaining weighting multiplied by a uniform random factor, with `‑inf` for infeasible bins. The 19th heuristic (second worst) adds a sigmoid term that attenuates the weight for bins with large residuals and also multiplies by a random factor. The extra sigmoid makes the scoring less aggressive, which explains its lower rank.  

- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Both favour tight fits via `1/(remaining)`. The 1st heuristic further adds a small bias proportional to absolute bin capacity, a jitter proportional to the weight, and finally normalises to probabilities. The 2nd heuristic lacks bias, jitter and normalisation, so it is more myopic and can produce extreme values.  

- **(3rd) vs (4th):** These two functions are identical copies of the 2nd heuristic. Their presence illustrates that identical implementations can occupy adjacent ranks without affecting performance; any difference in ranking would stem from external factors (e.g., execution context) rather than code.  

- **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst):** The 19th heuristic still respects the item‑size constraint (uses `bins_remain_cap >= item`) and blends inverse‑remaining, sigmoid smoothing, and randomness. The 20th worst‑fit ignores the residual entirely and only maximises remaining capacity, which often leads to poor packing efficiency.  

- **Overall:** The top‑ranked heuristics reward tight fits, add controlled randomness to break ties, and optionally bias toward larger bins while keeping scores numerically stable and normalised. Lower‑ranked heuristics either drop randomness, over‑simplify (worst‑fit), or apply excessive smoothing that dilutes the tight‑fit signal.

**Experience:**  
Prioritise inverse‑remaining capacity, add a modest bias for larger bins, inject small jitter, and normalise to probabilities. Avoid pure worst‑fit or overly smoothed scores; use randomness only to break ties, not dominate the heuristic.
