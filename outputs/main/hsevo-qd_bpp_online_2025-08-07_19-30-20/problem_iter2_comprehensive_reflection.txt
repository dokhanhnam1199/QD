- **Keywords**: stochastic bias, tight‑fit, –inf masking, epsilon stabilization, sigmoid/softmax, adaptive randomness.  
- **Advice**: Use adaptive probability distributions for bin selection, gradually tighten fit constraints, incorporate learning rates for mask thresholds, and blend deterministic with probabilistic moves.  
- **Avoid**: Fixed deterministic worst‑fit, static masks, overly aggressive tightening that causes infeasibility, and ignoring numerical precision.  
- **Explanation**: Adaptive stochasticity keeps solution diversity while steering toward tight packs; dynamic masks and smooth transforms prevent overflow/underflow and preserve feasibility.
