Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Inverse\u2011residual weighting with slight capacity bias and tiny random jitter.\"\"\"\n    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(mask):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    residual = bins_remain_cap - item\n    eps = 1e-12\n    inv_res = 1.0 / (residual + eps)\n    bias_factor = 0.05\n    max_cap = bins_remain_cap.max()\n    bias = bias_factor * bins_remain_cap / (max_cap + eps)\n    weight = inv_res + bias\n    weight[~mask] = 0.0\n    jitter = 1e-3 * weight * np.random.rand(weight.size)\n    weight += jitter\n    total = weight.sum()\n    if total == 0.0:\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    return weight / total\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords**: best\u2011fit, deterministic, integer arithmetic, lightweight, tie\u2011breaking  \n- **Advice**: Use best\u2011fit selection by computing the leftover space after placement and picking the bin that leaves the least; break ties randomly. Do not add \u03b5 or \u2013\u221e masking; use raw integer values.  \n- **Avoid**: Explicit \u2013\u221e masking, \u03b5 tricks, sigmoid/softmax smoothing, jitter, probability normalization, bias toward larger bins, deterministic worst\u2011fit.  \n- **Explanation**: This keeps the heuristic simple, fully deterministic except for tie\u2011breaking, avoids the pitfalls highlighted in the ineffective reflection, and uses only integer arithmetic for robustness.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
