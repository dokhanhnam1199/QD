- **Advice**: Use best‑fit selection by computing the leftover space after placement and picking the bin that leaves the least; break ties randomly. Do not add ε or –∞ masking; use raw integer values.  
- **Avoid**: Explicit –∞ masking, ε tricks, sigmoid/softmax smoothing, jitter, probability normalization, bias toward larger bins, deterministic worst‑fit.  
- **Explanation**: This keeps the heuristic simple, fully deterministic except for tie‑breaking, avoids the pitfalls highlighted in the ineffective reflection, and uses only integer arithmetic for robustness.
