- **Keywords:** inverse capacity weighting, modest size bias, tie‑break jitter, lean implementation.  
- **Advice:** Prioritise bins by inverse remaining capacity with a small bonus for larger bins; use tiny random jitter to resolve ties; normalise scores to probabilities; keep the algorithm straightforward and fast.  
- **Avoid:** hard masks, numeric stability hacks, smooth transforms like softmax, deterministic or worst‑fit strategies, excessive documentation; explicit –inf masking, epsilon tricks, max subtraction, sigmoid/softmax, and stochastic bias for tight fits.  
- **Explanation:** This balances fit efficiency with computational simplicity, preventing over‑complexity while still offering a robust, lightweight heuristic that can be benchmarked easily.
