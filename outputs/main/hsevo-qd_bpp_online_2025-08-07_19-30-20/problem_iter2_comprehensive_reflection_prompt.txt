{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrefer stochastic, tight\u2011fit bias with explicit `-inf` masking for infeasible bins; use stable numeric tricks (\u03b5, max subtraction) and smooth transforms (sigmoid/softmax) for controlled randomness. Avoid deterministic worst\u2011fit.
