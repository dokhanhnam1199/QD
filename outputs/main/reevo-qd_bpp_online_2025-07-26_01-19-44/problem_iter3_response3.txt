def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers the remaining capacity and penalizes bins that
    cannot fit the item. It gives higher priority to bins that are closer to being
    full but can still fit the item. New bins are penalized by giving them a low
    priority.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
