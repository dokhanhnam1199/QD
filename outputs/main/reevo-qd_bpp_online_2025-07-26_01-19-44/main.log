System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

Refer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `priority_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Use a max function to avoid negative priorities and ensure feasibility
    priority = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item) / item
    
    # Give a clear preference to bins that can fit the item at all
    can_fit_item_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priority[np.where(~can_fit_item_mask)] -= 2
    
    # Encourage the second smallest gaps (fill bigger empty spots尽早 to encourage less fragmentation)
    # Less penalty for bins pediatric returning subtle fragments after an insertion
    if np.any(can_fit_item_mask):
        priority_after_check = bins_remain_cap - item
        highest_remaining_capacities = np.partition(priority_after_check[can_fit_item_mask], 1)[:2]
        low = highest_remaining_capacities[0] if len(highest_remaining_capacities) > 1 else 0
        low_idx = np.where(np.isclose(priority_after_check, low))[0]
        if len(low_idx) == 1:
            priority[low_idx[0]] += 1  # boost solitare other fragment accent withok followers much step-water pour toplantı
    
    return priority

[Better code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Avoid division by zero, mask out bins that cannot fit the item
    remainder = bins_remain_cap - item
    can_fit_mask = remainder >= 0
    # Calculate the percentage of remaining capacity after adding the item
    filled_percentage = (1 - (remainder / bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]))
    # Prioritize bins that will have a lower filled percentage after adding the item
    priority_scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)  # Initialize with -Inf
    priority_scores[can_fit_mask] = -filled_percentage  # Priority is higher for lower filled percentage
    return priority_scores

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Worse code]
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Use a max function to avoid negative priorities and ensure feasibility
    priority = np.maximum(0, bins_remain_cap - item) / item
    
    # Give a clear preference to bins that can fit the item at all
    can_fit_item_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priority[np.where(~can_fit_item_mask)] -= 2
    
    # Encourage the second smallest gaps (fill bigger empty spots尽早 to encourage less fragmentation)
    # Less penalty for bins pediatric returning subtle fragments after an insertion
    if np.any(can_fit_item_mask):
        priority_after_check = bins_remain_cap - item
        highest_remaining_capacities = np.partition(priority_after_check[can_fit_item_mask], 1)[:2]
        low = highest_remaining_capacities[0] if len(highest_remaining_capacities) > 1 else 0
        low_idx = np.where(np.isclose(priority_after_check, low))[0]
        if len(low_idx) == 1:
            priority[low_idx[0]] += 1  # boost solitare other fragment accent withok followers much step-water pour toplantı
    
    return priority

[Better code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Avoid division by zero, mask out bins that cannot fit the item
    remainder = bins_remain_cap - item
    can_fit_mask = remainder >= 0
    # Calculate the percentage of remaining capacity after adding the item
    filled_percentage = (1 - (remainder / bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask]))
    # Prioritize bins that will have a lower filled percentage after adding the item
    priority_scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)  # Initialize with -Inf
    priority_scores[can_fit_mask] = -filled_percentage  # Priority is higher for lower filled percentage
    return priority_scores

[Reflection]
Prioritize bins by minimizing filled percentage, avoid negative capacities, ensure feasibility, and simplify calculations.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

[2025-07-26 01:22:58,998][root][INFO] - Long-term Reflection Prompt: 
System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize bins by minimizing filled percentage, avoid negative capacities, ensure feasibility, and simplify calculations.
Use weighted priorities, penalize non-fitting bins, and enhance large gaps' attractiveness to reduce fragmentation.
Use capacity ratios, penalize non-fitting bins, and distribute priority evenly across bins.
Prioritize bins with larger gaps, penalize non-fit bins strictly, and boost second smallest gaps.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity, penalize undersized bins, and boost second-largest gaps.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity, penalize inadequate bins, and slightly boost bins with smaller yet significant remaining gaps.
Focus on remaining capacity percentage; penalize bins that get nearly full. Avoid complex penalties; prioritize directly.
Use capacity ratios, penalize non-fitting bins, and distribute priority evenly across bins.
Prioritize bins by capacity ratio, penalize non-fitting, and use regularization to encourage completeness and diversity.
Use penalties for new bins, prioritize fitting bins, and normalize priorities for better distribution.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Prioritize bins by remaining capacity, penalize non-fitting ones, and use capacity ratios. Evenly distribute priorities. Penalize new bins. Focus on simplicity and feasibility, avoid complex penalties.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios. Also, it encourages
    filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Base priority: higher for bins that can fit the item with less remaining space
    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / item, -1)

    # Penalize bins that are nearly empty to avoid creating unused bins
    nearly_empty_penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap == 0, -1, 0)
    priority += nearly_empty_penalty

    # Boost bins that can just fit the item precisely
    perfect_fit_boost = np.where(bins_remain_cap == item, 0.5, 0)
    priority += perfect_fit_boost

    # Encourage filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation
    # Identify bins that can fit the item and have more than the average remaining capacity
    if np.any(bins_remain_cap >= item):
        avg_remaining = np.mean(bins_remain_cap[bins_remain_cap >= item])
        large_gap_boost = np.where((bins_remain_cap >= item) & (bins_remain_cap > avg_remaining), 0.5, 0)
        priority += large_gap_boost

    return priority

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios. It encourages
    filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation. The function also penalizes bins
    that are nearly empty more heavily and boosts perfect fits more significantly.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
