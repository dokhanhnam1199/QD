Adjust penalties and boosts dynamically, prioritize precise fits, penalize unused bins, and boost larger gaps aggressively.
Simplify penalties and boosts, use fixed weights, avoid dynamic calculations, focus on clear item-bin fits.
Use larger penalties and boosts, adjust weights, and favor bins filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation and better utilize bin space.
Adjust penalties and boosts dynamically, prioritize precise fits, penalize unused bins, and boost larger gaps aggressively.
Adjust weights dynamically, prioritize large gaps, penalize emptiness aggressively, boost perfect fits significantly.
