Avoid penalties for nearly empty bins; prioritize bins with smaller gaps using capacity ratios and average thresholds.
Incorporate multiple criteria, balance penalties and boosts, and account for bin utilization and fragmentation.
Use capacity ratios, penalize non-fitting bins strictly, regularize for even distribution to reduce fragmentation.
Combine remaining capacity, penalize nearly empty bins, and boost potential perfect fits and large gaps.
Penalize non-fitting bins heavily, use negative remaining capacity for priority, and add regularization for even distribution.
Scale priorities better, penalize empty bins, and prioritize near perfect fits more.
Use clear penalties, prioritize larger gaps, and boost secondary gaps carefully.
Prioritize bins with less remaining space, penalize near-empty, boost perfect fits, encourage larger gaps.
Prioritize bins closer to full, penalize nearly empty bins, and encourage filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation.
Focus on balancing remaining capacity and bin usage; penalize non-fitting bins strictly; prioritize nearly-full bins more.
