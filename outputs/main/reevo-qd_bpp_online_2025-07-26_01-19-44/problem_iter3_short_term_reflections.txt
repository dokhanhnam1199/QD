Prioritize bins by minimizing filled percentage, avoid negative capacities, ensure feasibility, and simplify calculations.
Use weighted priorities, penalize non-fitting bins, and enhance large gaps' attractiveness to reduce fragmentation.
Use capacity ratios, penalize non-fitting bins, and distribute priority evenly across bins.
Prioritize bins with larger gaps, penalize non-fit bins strictly, and boost second smallest gaps.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity, penalize undersized bins, and boost second-largest gaps.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity, penalize inadequate bins, and slightly boost bins with smaller yet significant remaining gaps.
Focus on remaining capacity percentage; penalize bins that get nearly full. Avoid complex penalties; prioritize directly.
Use capacity ratios, penalize non-fitting bins, and distribute priority evenly across bins.
Prioritize bins by capacity ratio, penalize non-fitting, and use regularization to encourage completeness and diversity.
Use penalties for new bins, prioritize fitting bins, and normalize priorities for better distribution.
