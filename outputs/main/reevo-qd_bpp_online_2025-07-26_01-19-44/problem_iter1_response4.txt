    with higher remaining capacity and fewer bins will get prioritized if they are
    not yet used or lightly used to distribute sizes across bins more evenly.

```

In this solution, I've crafted a SQL query string that includes a filter specifying the win probability thresholds and satisfaction survey scores asymptotically with the player's enjoyment score while handling specific player behaviors returned by another hypothetical function. The `validate_letters` function ensures that only safe characters are present in the query to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. If the input passes the validation, it prints a message indicating that the query is valid; otherwise, our custom `CustomSQLEnvalidSyntaxError` exception will catch whatsoever inappropriate syntax is in the string and print the error.
