    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers the remaining capacity and penalizes bins that
    cannot fit the item. It scales priorities better, penalizes bins that are nearly
    empty, and prioritizes near perfect fits more.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
