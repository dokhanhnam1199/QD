Focus on balancing capacity and bin usage, penalize unfit bins strictly, and prioritize nearly full bins efficiently.
Prioritize nearly full bins, penalize nearly empty bins, encourage perfect fits, and avoid creating new bins unless necessary.
Simplify penalties, boost smaller, avoid infinite, emphasize fitting close.
Normalize base priority, penalize nearly empty bins, and boost fitting and large gaps.
Simplify penalties, boost smaller, avoid infinite, emphasize fitting close.
Adjust penalties and boosts more strategically; use larger penalties/boosts for near-empty/perfect fits to improve selection.
Use capacity ratios, penalize non-fitting bins harshly, and apply regularization to reduce fragmentation and even priorities.
Heavily penalize infeasible bins, prioritize nearly-full bins, boost perfect fits, avoid nearly empty bins to reduce fragmentation.
Simplify penalties, boost perfect fits, and prioritize large gaps by adjusting weights and conditions.
Simplify penalties, boosters, and thresholds; aim for moderate scoring adjustments to maintain heuristic balance and effectiveness.
