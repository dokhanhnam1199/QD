BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nPrioritize bins by remaining capacity, penalize nearly-empty bins heavily, and boost perfect fits. Incorporate balance between fragmentation and even distribution to improve packing efficiency.\n\n[Code]\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of\n    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher\n    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining\n    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios. Also, it encourages\n    filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base priority: higher for bins that can fit the item with less remaining space\n    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / item, -1)\n\n    # Penalize bins that are nearly empty to avoid creating unused bins\n    nearly_empty_penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap == 0, -1, 0)\n    priority += nearly_empty_penalty\n\n    # Boost bins that can just fit the item precisely\n    perfect_fit_boost = np.where(bins_remain_cap == item, 0.5, 0)\n    priority += perfect_fit_boost\n\n    # Encourage filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation\n    # Identify bins that can fit the item and have more than the average remaining capacity\n    if np.any(bins_remain_cap >= item):\n        avg_remaining = np.mean(bins_remain_cap[bins_remain_cap >= item])\n        large_gap_boost = np.where((bins_remain_cap >= item) & (bins_remain_cap > avg_remaining), 0.5, 0)\n        priority += large_gap_boost\n\n    return priority\n\n[Improved code]\nPlease write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection.
