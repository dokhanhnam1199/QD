Simplify penalties and boosts, use consistent weights, focus on prioritizing near-full bins effectively.
Simplify penalties, boost perfect fits, and use clearer thresholds; balance weights for practical efficiency.
Adjust penalties and boosts dynamically, prioritize precise fits, penalize unused bins, and boost larger gaps aggressively.
Simplify penalties and boosts, use consistent weights, focus on prioritizing near-full bins effectively.
Use larger penalties and boosts, adjust weights, and favor bins filling larger gaps to reduce fragmentation and better utilize bin space.
Simplify penalties, boost perfect fits, and use clearer thresholds; balance weights for practical efficiency.
Use fixed weights, simplify penalty/boost mechanisms, balance complexity.
Simplify penalties and boosts, use consistent weights, focus on prioritizing near-full bins effectively.
Boost perfect fits, penalize emptiness heavily, increase gap threshold, and adjust penalties and boosts systematically.
Use fixed weights, simplify penalty/boost mechanisms, balance complexity efficiently.
