- **Keywords:** best‑fit, fixed ε‑greedy, capped additive boost, dead‑space filter  
- **Advice:** Use negative slack as the sole score, apply a small constant ε for random selection, add a modest capped additive boost to all bins as a tie‑breaker, and drop dead‑space‑only candidates.  
- **Avoid:** dynamic ε‑decay, explicit infeasibility flags, problem‑specific near‑full or exact‑fit bonuses, jitter, layered ratio/fit scoring, multiplicative or over‑parameterized boosts, per‑item random mixing, softmax compression, adaptive exploration schedules.  
- **Explanation:** Simpler scoring reduces hidden bias and overhead, static exploration guarantees predictable coverage, capped additive boosts keep decisions interpretable, and removing complex mechanisms improves maintainability and runtime stability.
