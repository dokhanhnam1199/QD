**Analysis:**  
- **Heuristic – 1st vs 20th:** The 1st uses ε‑greedy randomness, scores feasible bins by negative slack (best‑fit) and marks infeasible bins with ‑∞. The 20th simply returns remaining capacity (worst‑fit) for feasible bins, no exploration, and no explicit handling of infeasibility beyond ‑∞.  
- **Heuristic – 2nd vs 19th:** The 2nd mirrors the 1st (identical code), while the 19th mirrors the 20th (worst‑fit). The same strengths/weaknesses apply.  
- **Heuristic – 1st vs 2nd:** Identical implementation; no observable difference.  
- **Heuristic – 3rd vs 4th:** The 3rd retains the ε‑greedy random exploration of the 1st, whereas the 4th drops randomness and only applies deterministic best‑fit scoring. The added exploration gives the 3rd a slight edge.  
- **Heuristic – 19th vs 20th:** Both implement the same worst‑fit strategy; differences are only naming conventions, yielding equivalent performance.  
- **Overall:** Top heuristics combine best‑fit scoring, explicit infeasibility handling (‑∞), and controlled randomness (ε‑greedy). Mid‑range variants add softmax or inverse‑slack but often lack clear documentation. Bottom heuristics rely on naive worst‑fit or pure random scores, missing both exploitation and robust infeasibility checks.  

**Experience:**  
Effective heuristics document intent, treat infeasibility explicitly, prioritize minimizing slack (best‑fit), and incorporate ε‑greedy exploration; avoid naive worst‑fit or unnormalized random scoring.
