- **Keywords:** static ε, normalized slack ratio, implicit infeasibility, stateless, softmax selection  
- **Advice:** Use a constant small ε for occasional random picks, score each item as (capacity‑slack)/capacity, turn scores into probabilities via a softmax, and keep functions pure with no extra parameters.  
- **Avoid:** per‑iteration ε adjustments, custom near‑full bonuses, jitter, stateful objects, explicit infeasibility flags, multiplicative or additive boost terms, random mixing per element, over‑parameterized designs.  
- **Explanation:** These choices keep the heuristic transparent, limit hidden bias, ensure reproducibility and generality, and focus the search on true capacity efficiency without fragile problem‑specific tricks.
