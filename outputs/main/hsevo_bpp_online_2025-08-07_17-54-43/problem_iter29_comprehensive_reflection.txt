- **Keywords:** adaptive deterministic core, explicit infeasibility marking, near‑full/exact‑fit bonuses, lightweight jitter, vectorized simple scoring.  
- **Advice:** Use a best‑fit core with ε‑greedy decay, add near‑full/exact‑fit boosts, mark infeasible moves explicitly, jitter scores slightly; keep logic vectorized and well‑documented.  
- **Avoid:** static ε, duplicated code, heavy softmax, over‑parameterization, multiplicative boosts, per‑item random mixing, dead branches.  
- **Explanation:** These choices clarify intent, cut noise, enforce feasibility, and enable easy tuning, yielding more robust, high‑quality packings.
