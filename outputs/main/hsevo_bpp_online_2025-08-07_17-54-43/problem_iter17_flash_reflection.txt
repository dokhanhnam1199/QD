**Analysis:**  
- **1st vs 20th:** The top heuristic uses a *decaying* ε‑greedy rate, a fixed near‑full slack boost, and returns raw priorities (‑slack) for feasible bins, preserving fine‑grained ordering. The worst heuristic (20th) only applies a static inverse‑slack score, optional ε‑greedy, and then **softmax‑normalises** the probabilities, which compresses differences and discards the explicit near‑full/exact‑fit signals.  
- **2nd vs 19th:** Both share the same static inverse‑slack boost, but the 2nd adds an adaptive ε based on feasibility ratio and a tiny tie‑breaker, while the 19th lacks any feasibility‑aware ε schedule and uses the same softmax step, making exploration less informed.  
- **1st vs 2nd:** Although their code is almost identical, the 1st emphasizes *adaptive decay* of ε across calls, giving a smoother transition from exploration to exploitation; the 2nd re‑initialises ε each call (no decay), leading to higher stochasticity over time.  
- **3rd vs 4th:** The 3rd (duplicate of 1st/2nd) retains the simple “‑slack + near‑full boost” priority, whereas the 4th replaces the fixed boost with an *inverse‑slack* term and a static ε tied to the feasible fraction. The inverse‑slack can over‑emphasise very small slacks, causing instability compared to the controlled +0.5 boost.  
- **19th vs 20th:** Both are identical copies; they suffer from the same softmax compression and lack of exact‑fit detection, making them indistinguishable in performance and confirming that duplication without variation adds no value.  

**Overall:** The best heuristics combine (i) explicit feasibility checks, (ii) adaptive ε‑greedy exploration that decays with experience, (iii) deterministic near‑full and exact‑fit bonuses, and (iv) minimal jitter to break ties. Lower‑ranked versions either omit adaptive ε, replace fixed boosts with aggressive inverse‑slack terms, or over‑normalize via softmax, eroding priority resolution.  

**Experience:**  
Design heuristics that decay ε, reward near‑full/exact fits, keep scores raw (or lightly jittered), and avoid heavy softmax compression for clearer, more effective bin‑selection decisions.
