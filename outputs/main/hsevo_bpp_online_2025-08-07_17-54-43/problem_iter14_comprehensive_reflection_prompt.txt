{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nUse adaptive \u03b5\u2011decay, smooth slack\u2011based boosts plus jitter, add near\u2011full and exact\u2011fit bonuses, keep imports minimal, and document intent clearly for robust, maintainable heuristics.\nEffective heuristics document intent, treat infeasibility explicitly, prioritize minimizing slack (best\u2011fit), and incorporate \u03b5\u2011greedy exploration; avoid naive worst\u2011fit or unnormalized random scoring.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDynamic \u03b5\u2011decay, explicit infeasibility marking, and problem\u2011specific boosts (e.g., near\u2011full) markedly improve heuristic quality; static, duplicated code lacks adaptability and thus underperforms. Use stateful parameters and targeted incentives for better designs.\n\nDesign heuristics with clear, minimal scoring, modest additive boosts, strict infeasibility masking, and a simple \u03b5\u2011greedy switch. Avoid over\u2011parameterization, multiplicative boosts, and per\u2011element random mixing, which obscure intent and harm performance.\n\nAdaptive \u03b5 decay, inverse\u2011slack scoring, and item\u2011specific near\u2011full/exact\u2011fit boosts consistently outperform fixed\u2011\u03b5, linear\u2011slack, or incomplete designs; prioritize dynamic exploration control and per\u2011item capacity tailoring in future heuristic construction.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
