**Analysis:**

- **Comparing (1st) vs (20th),** we see the 1st heuristic employs a fully‑fledged epsilon‑greedy strategy with a decaying epsilon, near‑full capacity boost, and robust infeasibility handling, all documented in the docstring. The 20th heuristic, however, is incomplete—missing core logic after the feasibility check, contains unused imports, and offers no explanatory comments.

- **Comparing (2nd) vs (19th),** the 2nd function is identical to the 1st, reusing the same adaptive exploration and boosting mechanism. In contrast, the 19th heuristic is a broken template: it declares numerous hyperparameters and imports but never computes scores, leaving the algorithm unusable and poorly documented.

- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd),** there is essentially no difference; both contain identical logic and docstrings. The repeated implementation indicates either a copy‑and‑paste oversight or a deliberate attempt to reinforce the design, but it adds no functional value.

- **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th),** again the two functions are the same, mirroring the 1st–2nd pair. This redundancy shows a lack of code variance, making it harder to compare subtle improvements or trade‑offs.

- **Comparing (18th) vs (19th) (second worst vs worst),** both functions are incomplete: 18th uses static epsilon exploration with near‑full boosting, while 19th declares a plethora of hyperparameters yet lacks implementation after feasibility checking. Neither is fully functional or well‑commented.

- **Overall,** the strongest heuristics combine adaptive exploration, near‑full bonuses, and ratio penalties while ensuring all branches are implemented and clearly documented. The weakest fail to do so, relying on incomplete code and unnecessary complexity.

**Experience:**  
The analysis highlights the value of adaptive exploration, near‑full bonuses, and ratio penalties, coupled with robust feasibility handling. Simpler deterministic strategies are easier to reason about, but random exploration often yields better packings. Consistency, clear documentation, and avoiding dead or over‑complex code are crucial. A modular design that can toggle key components will make future tweaks straightforward.
