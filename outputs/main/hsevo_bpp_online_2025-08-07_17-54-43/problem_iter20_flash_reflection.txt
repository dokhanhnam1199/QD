**Analysis:**

- **(Best) vs (Worst) – #1 vs #5**  
  *#1* implements an *adaptive ε‑greedy best‑fit* policy: it initializes static ε parameters, decays ε each call, computes `-slack` as the deterministic score, adds a `+0.5` boost for bins whose slack ≤ `max(0.02, 0.05·item)`, and falls back to a full‑random ranking with probability ε. It also returns `-inf` for infeasible bins.  
  *#5* merely returns `item / bins_remain_cap` (or `-inf`) – no slack, no near‑full or exact‑fit bonuses, no exploration, and no tie‑breaking. The scoring is far less discriminative.

- **(Second best) vs (Second worst) – #2 vs #8**  
  *#2* is a verbatim copy of #1, inheriting the same robust design.  
  *#8* repeats #5’s naive ratio heuristic, offering no adaptive behavior or bonuses, thus clearly inferior.

- **(1st) vs (2nd) – #1 vs #2**  
  The two functions are byte‑for‑byte identical; there is no functional improvement, indicating redundancy rather than a true progression.

- **(3rd) vs (4th) – #3 vs #4**  
  *#3* normalizes slack (`-slack / bins_remain_cap`), adds a tiny random noise term, uses `np.isclose` for exact fits, and computes ε as `0.05·(1‑feasible/n)`. It contains dead code (`np.random0`) and a convoluted epsilon scheme, making it brittle.  
  *#4* cleanly computes `-slack`, applies a capped boost `min(boost_factor/(slack+tiny), max_boost)`, adds a modest ratio weight (`0.1·ratio`), and sets ε based on the feasible‑bin proportion. The implementation is clearer, more stable, and mathematically grounded.

- **(Second worst) vs (Worst) – #8 vs #18**  
  *#8* repeats the simple ratio approach of #5.  
  *#18* defines many hyper‑parameters and a detailed docstring but aborts after checking feasibility, never assigning scores. It is the least functional of the set.

- **Overall**  
  The top‑ranked heuristics (#1, #2, #4, #6, #9‑#17) share key strengths:  
  1. **Feasibility masking** (`bins_remain_cap >= item`) with `-inf` for infeasible bins.  
  2. **Deterministic best‑fit core** (`-slack`).  
  3. **Near‑full / exact‑fit bonuses** (e.g., `+0.5` for small slack, `+1.0` for exact fits).  
  4. **Adaptive ε‑greedy exploration**, often with decay (`ε = max(ε_min, ε·decay)`).  
  5. **Tiny jitter** (`1e‑6·rand`) to break ties.  
  Lower‑ranked versions either omit these mechanisms, contain bugs (dead code, undefined symbols), or are incomplete.

**Experience:** Combine a clear best‑fit core (‑slack) with adaptive ε‑greedy decay, near‑full/exact‑fit boosts, and jitter; keep code vectorized, well‑documented, and free of dead branches for robust, high‑quality heuristics.
