Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Adaptive epsilon\u2011greedy best\u2011fit priority with near\u2011full boost and infeasibility handling.\"\"\"\n    if not hasattr(priority_v2, \"_epsilon\"):\n        priority_v2._epsilon = 0.2\n        priority_v2._epsilon_min = 0.01\n        priority_v2._epsilon_decay = 0.995\n        priority_v2._step = 0\n    priority_v2._step += 1\n    priority_v2._epsilon = max(priority_v2._epsilon_min, priority_v2._epsilon * priority_v2._epsilon_decay)\n    n = bins_remain_cap.size\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(valid):\n        return priorities\n    slack = bins_remain_cap[valid] - item\n    base_priority = -slack\n    near_full_thresh = max(0.02, 0.05 * item)\n    boost = 0.5\n    base_priority[slack <= near_full_thresh] += boost\n    priorities[valid] = base_priority\n    if np.random.rand() < priority_v2._epsilon:\n        rand_scores = np.random.rand(n)\n        rand_scores[~valid] = -np.inf\n        priorities = rand_scores\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** best\u2011fit, fixed \u03b5\u2011greedy, capped additive boost, dead\u2011space filter  \n- **Advice:** Use negative slack as the sole score, apply a small constant \u03b5 for random selection, add a modest capped additive boost to all bins as a tie\u2011breaker, and drop dead\u2011space\u2011only candidates.  \n- **Avoid:** dynamic \u03b5\u2011decay, explicit infeasibility flags, problem\u2011specific near\u2011full or exact\u2011fit bonuses, jitter, layered ratio/fit scoring, multiplicative or over\u2011parameterized boosts, per\u2011item random mixing, softmax compression, adaptive exploration schedules.  \n- **Explanation:** Simpler scoring reduces hidden bias and overhead, static exploration guarantees predictable coverage, capped additive boosts keep decisions interpretable, and removing complex mechanisms improves maintainability and runtime stability.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
