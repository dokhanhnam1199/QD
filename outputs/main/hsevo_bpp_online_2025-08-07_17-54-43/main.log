### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Effective heuristics document intent, treat infeasibility explicitly, prioritize minimizing slack (best‑fit), and incorporate ε‑greedy exploration; avoid naive worst‑fit or unnormalized random scoring.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

Response (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    eps = 0.1
    n = bins_remain_cap.size
    if np.random.rand() < eps:
        return np.random.random(n)
    priorities = -np.inf * np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities[valid] = -(bins_remain_cap[valid] - item)
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    residual = bins_remain_cap - item
    feasible = residual >= 0
    priorities = np.where(feasible, -residual, -np.inf)
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- - **Heuristic – 1st vs 20th:** The 1st uses ε‑greedy randomness, scores feasible bins by negative slack (best‑fit) and marks infeasible bins with ‑∞. The 20th simply returns remaining capacity (worst‑fit) for feasible bins, no exploration, and no explicit handling of infeasibility beyond ‑∞.  
- **Heuristic – 2nd vs 19th:** The 2nd mirrors the 1st (identical code), while the 19th mirrors the 20th (worst‑fit). The same strengths/weaknesses apply.  
- **Heuristic – 1st vs 2nd:** Identical implementation; no observable difference.  
- **Heuristic – 3rd vs 4th:** The 3rd retains the ε‑greedy random exploration of the 1st, whereas the 4th drops randomness and only applies deterministic best‑fit scoring. The added exploration gives the 3rd a slight edge.  
- **Heuristic – 19th vs 20th:** Both implement the same worst‑fit strategy; differences are only naming conventions, yielding equivalent performance.  
- **Overall:** Top heuristics combine best‑fit scoring, explicit infeasibility handling (‑∞), and controlled randomness (ε‑greedy). Mid‑range variants add softmax or inverse‑slack but often lack clear documentation. Bottom heuristics rely on naive worst‑fit or pure random scores, missing both exploitation and robust infeasibility checks.
- 
- **Keywords**: Intent‑driven, infeasibility handling, slack minimization (best‑fit), ε‑greedy exploration, adaptive decay.  
- **Advice**: Step 1: Document intent. Step 2: Adaptive ε‑decay. Step 3: Local slack repair. Step 4: Scenario validation.  
- **Avoid**: Fixed greedy orders, static ε, naive worst‑fit, unnormalized random scoring, ignoring infeasible states, one‑size‑fits‑all callbacks.  
- **Explanation**: Adaptive ε balances exploration/exploitation, local repair fixes slack, scenario testing uncovers corner cases, clear documentation supports reproducibility and tuning.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.
Output the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    eps = 0.1
    n = bins_remain_cap.size
    if np.random.rand() < eps:
        return np.random.random(n)
    priorities = -np.inf * np.ones_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities[valid] = -(bins_remain_cap[valid] - item)
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
- **Keywords**: Intent‑driven, infeasibility handling, slack minimization (best‑fit), ε‑greedy exploration, adaptive decay.  
- **Advice**: Step 1: Document intent. Step 2: Adaptive ε‑decay. Step 3: Local slack repair. Step 4: Scenario validation.  
- **Avoid**: Fixed greedy orders, static ε, naive worst‑fit, unnormalized random scoring, ignoring infeasible states, one‑size‑fits‑all callbacks.  
- **Explanation**: Adaptive ε balances exploration/exploitation, local repair fixes slack, scenario testing uncovers corner cases, clear documentation supports reproducibility and tuning.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.
