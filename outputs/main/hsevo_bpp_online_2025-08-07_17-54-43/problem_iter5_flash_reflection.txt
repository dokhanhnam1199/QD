**Analysis:**  
- **Comparing (best) Heuristic 1 vs (worst) Heuristic 20:** 1️⃣’s docstring emphasizes “adaptive epsilon‑greedy…near‑full boost and infeasibility handling.” Its code stores `_epsilon`, `_epsilon_min`, `decay`, and a step counter, decays ε each call, adds a 0.5 boost when slack ≤ near_full_thresh, and returns `‑inf` for infeasible bins. 2️⃣0️⃣’s docstring mentions “combines best‑fit and worst‑fit…optional epsilon‑greedy exploration.” It uses fixed `epsilon=0.1`, static `alpha=0.1`, no decay, no boost, and simply adds a small noise term. Thus the best version adapts exploration, exploits near‑full bins, and guards infeasibility, while the worst is static, duplicated, and lacks these refinements.  

- **Comparing (second best) Heuristic 2 vs (second worst) Heuristic 19:** 2️⃣ is identical to 1️⃣ (same adaptive ε, near‑full boost, `‑inf` handling). 1️⃣9️⃣ mixes best‑fit (`1/(waste+1e‑12)`) with a worst‑fit bias (`+ α·waste`) and adds additive noise (`ε·rand`). It has fixed hyper‑parameters and no stateful decay. The adaptive, boost‑oriented design of 2️⃣ gives more focused exploitation and controlled exploration than the static blend of 1️⃣9️⃣.  

- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Both functions are byte‑for‑byte copies: identical docstring, attribute initialization, ε‑decay, near‑full boost, and infeasibility handling. No observable difference.  

- **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th):** Again exact duplicates. Both use a fixed `eps=0.1`, choose random scores with probability `eps`, otherwise rank by `1/(slack+ε)`. They lack adaptive ε, near‑full boost, and any explicit handling beyond `‑inf` for infeasible bins.  

- **Comparing (second worst) Heuristic 19 vs (worst) Heuristic 20:** Identical implementations; same docstring, same static parameters, and same scoring formula. No distinction.  

- **Overall:** The ranking rewards heuristics that maintain internal state (adaptive ε decay, step counter), apply domain‑specific boosts (near‑full bins), and rigorously mark infeasible bins with `‑inf`. Static, duplicated implementations without adaptation or specialized scoring occupy the lower ranks. Adaptive exploration and targeted exploitation consistently separate higher‑ranked heuristics from lower‑ranked ones.  

**Experience:**  
Dynamic ε‑decay, explicit infeasibility marking, and problem‑specific boosts (e.g., near‑full) markedly improve heuristic quality; static, duplicated code lacks adaptability and thus underperforms. Use stateful parameters and targeted incentives for better designs.
