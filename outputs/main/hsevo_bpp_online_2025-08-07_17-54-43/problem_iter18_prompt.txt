Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Adaptive epsilon\u2011greedy best\u2011fit priority with near\u2011full boost and infeasibility handling.\"\"\"\n    if not hasattr(priority_v2, \"_epsilon\"):\n        priority_v2._epsilon = 0.2\n        priority_v2._epsilon_min = 0.01\n        priority_v2._epsilon_decay = 0.995\n        priority_v2._step = 0\n    priority_v2._step += 1\n    priority_v2._epsilon = max(priority_v2._epsilon_min, priority_v2._epsilon * priority_v2._epsilon_decay)\n    n = bins_remain_cap.size\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(valid):\n        return priorities\n    slack = bins_remain_cap[valid] - item\n    base_priority = -slack\n    near_full_thresh = max(0.02, 0.05 * item)\n    boost = 0.5\n    base_priority[slack <= near_full_thresh] += boost\n    priorities[valid] = base_priority\n    if np.random.rand() < priority_v2._epsilon:\n        rand_scores = np.random.rand(n)\n        rand_scores[~valid] = -np.inf\n        priorities = rand_scores\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** deterministic, monotonic, ratio ranking, reproducibility.  \n- **Advice:** use a single-pass ordering that ranks items by decreasing size\u2011to\u2011remaining capacity ratio; place items only when they satisfy the bin capacity; keep the ranking linear and fixed; set predefined thresholds before execution.  \n- **Avoid:** any nondeterministic adjustments, complex normalizations (softmax, exponential scaling), multi\u2011stage pipelines, any extra ranking beyond the primary ratio.  \n- **Explanation:** Simple monotonic rankings yield transparent bin selections, low overhead, and repeatable results, while avoiding heavy transformations preserves stability and performance.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
