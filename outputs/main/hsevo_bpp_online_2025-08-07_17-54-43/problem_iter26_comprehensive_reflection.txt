- **Keywords**: remaining capacity, deterministic tie‑break, capacity ordering, static parameters.  
- **Advice**: Choose the bin with the smallest remaining capacity (raw free space) and break ties by a fixed priority; keep the scoring rule linear and plain.  
- **Avoid**: adaptive ε‑decay, near‑full, jitter, explicit infeasibility flags, multiplicative boosts, per‑item random mixing, softmax scaling, stateful parameters.  
- **Explanation**: A simple deterministic, slack‑based heuristic stays transparent, eliminates hidden hyper‑parameters, and yields stable performance across diverse instances.
