{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDynamic \u03b5\u2011decay, explicit infeasibility marking, and problem\u2011specific boosts (e.g., near\u2011full) markedly improve heuristic quality; static, duplicated code lacks adaptability and thus underperforms. Use stateful parameters and targeted incentives for better designs.\nEffective heuristics document intent, treat infeasibility explicitly, prioritize minimizing slack (best\u2011fit), and incorporate \u03b5\u2011greedy exploration; avoid naive worst\u2011fit or unnormalized random scoring.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
