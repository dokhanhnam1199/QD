```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Exact Fit First priority for online bin packing."""
    diff = bins_remain_cap - diff? Let's correct:```

Apologies, there is a mistake. Need to correct code: 
```
``````python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    diff = bins_remain_cap - item
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    exact = diff == 0
    priorities[exact] = np.inf
    fit = diff > 0
    priorities[fit] = -diff[fit]
    return priorities
