- **Keywords:** simplicity, static ε‑greedy, normalized additive scoring, implicit infeasibility penalty.  
- **Advice:** Use a fixed ε for exploration, compute a single normalized additive score for each candidate, apply a large negative penalty for infeasible choices, and keep all parameters constant.  
- **Avoid:** Dynamic ε‑decay, problem‑specific or stateful boosts, explicit infeasibility flags, multiplicative or per‑element random mixing.  
- **Explanation:** This yields transparent, low‑overhead heuristics that generalize without over‑parameterization or hidden adaptations.
