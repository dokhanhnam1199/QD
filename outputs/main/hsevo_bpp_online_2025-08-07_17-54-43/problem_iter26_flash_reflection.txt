**Analysis:**
- **Best vs Worst** – The best function uses an adaptive epsilon‑greedy scheme with a decaying epsilon, a negative‑slack base priority, a near‑full boost, and proper infeasibility handling. The worst is an incomplete stub that returns all ‑∞ scores, imports many unused modules, and lacks any real scoring logic.
- **Second Best vs Second Worst** – The second best mirrors the best (adaptive epsilon, slack scoring, near‑full boost). The second worst is essentially identical to the worst: it contains no scoring logic and merely returns ‑∞ for all bins.
- **1st vs 2nd** – These two functions are identical; both implement the same adaptive, near‑full‑boosted, best‑fit logic, so there is no performance difference.
- **3rd vs 4th** – The 3rd function keeps the adaptive epsilon and near‑full logic. The 4th uses a static epsilon, simple best‑fit scoring, and only a tiny index offset for tie‑breaking; it lacks dynamic exploration or slack bonuses.
- **Second Worst vs Worst** – Both are incomplete and return no priorities. The worst additionally imports unnecessary modules (random, math, scipy, torch), making it less efficient.
- **Overall** – Top heuristics integrate adaptive exploration, negative‑slack base priority, near‑full boosts, ratio penalties, jitter, and robust infeasibility handling. Bottom heuristics miss these features or are syntactically incomplete, leading to poor or undefined behavior.

**Experience:**
Leverage adaptive epsilon decay, negative slack as base, near‑full boosting, ratio penalties, and jitter to stabilize bin choices; keep code minimal, test priority outputs, and avoid unused imports to build robust, scalable heuristics.
