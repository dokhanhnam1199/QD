**Analysis:**  
Comparing Heuristic 1 (adaptive ε‑greedy with decay, near‑full boost, clear docstring) vs Heuristic 20 (static ε‑greedy, only a near‑full boost, generic docstring) shows the impact of adaptive exploration: ε decays over time, reducing random moves, while Heuristic 20’s ε stays fixed, leading to unnecessary randomness. Heuristic 1 uses `-np.inf` for infeasible bins, whereas Heuristic 20 uses an arbitrary huge negative sentinel, making infeasibility handling less clean.  

Heuristic 2 is identical to Heuristic 1; the ranking discrepancy likely reflects non‑code factors (e.g., runtime overhead) rather than functionality.  

Heuristic 3 employs a simple linear penalty (`-slack`) and computes ε as `0.05 × (1 – valid_count/n)`. It lacks a docstring and only adds a tiny random boost, so its guidance is weak. In contrast, Heuristics 4‑6 contain many unused imports, an enormous default priority (`-5.857e11`), and a high ε‑factor (~0.82). Their docstrings mention “epsilon_factor” and “tie_breaker,” but the parameters are arbitrarily large, causing excessive randomness and poorer deterministic decisions.  

Heuristics 7‑9 use inverse‑slack (`1/(slack+ε)`) with a fixed ε‑greedy fallback (0.1). They have no near‑full or exact‑fit boosts, making them less discriminative. Heuristic 10 introduces a smooth boost `0.5/(slack+tiny)` capped at 5, adds jitter, and uses a modest ε = 0.05 fallback. Its docstring explicitly cites “best‑fit, smooth tightness boost, jitter,” yielding finer granularity and better tie‑breaking than Heuristics 7‑9.  

Comparing Heuristic 10 with Heuristic 11 (inverse‑slack plus step‑wise boosts) highlights that a continuous boost (10) provides smoother ranking than the step‑wise 0.5 boost and exact‑fit boost of 2.0 in 11. Both use ε‑greedy, but only 10 adds jitter, reducing lock‑in on equal scores.  

Heuristic 15 adds an exact‑fit boost (1.0) and a fixed near‑full threshold (0.05) on top of a static ε = 0.1. Heuristic 16 refines this by separating a relative factor (0.05 × item) and an absolute floor (0.02), and uses `np.isclose` for exact fits. This extra flexibility improves handling of varied item sizes, explaining why 16 outranks 15.  

Heuristic 18 (and duplicates 19‑20) omit the exact‑fit boost altogether and rely solely on a near‑full boost, with a static ε. The lack of adaptive ε decay and smoother boosting makes it the weakest among the best‑fit family.  

Overall, the ranking reflects three clear design trends: (1) adaptive ε‑decay outperforms static ε; (2) smooth, continuous slack‑based boosts with jitter dominate step‑wise or purely inverse‑slack scores; (3) concise code, purposeful imports, and well‑written docstrings correlate with higher ranks, while redundant imports and arbitrary large constants penalize lower ranks.  

**Experience:** Use adaptive ε‑decay, smooth slack‑based boosts plus jitter, add near‑full and exact‑fit bonuses, keep imports minimal, and document intent clearly for robust, maintainable heuristics.
