**Analysis:**  
Comparing #1 (best) vs #20 (worst), we see #1 implements a full adaptive ε‑greedy best‑fit with near‑full boost, infeasibility handling and jitter, while #20 is merely a stub with no scoring logic. #2 vs #19 shows the same gap: #2 is a complete adaptive‑ε version, #19 is empty. #3 vs #18: #3 mixes best‑fit, ratio weighting, a small fixed ε‑greedy and jitter; #18 lacks any functional code. #4 vs #17: #4 uses dead‑space avoidance and a ratio‑only score but no exploration, whereas #17 is a placeholder. #5 vs #16: #5 features adaptive ε that shrinks with feasibility, capped inverse‑slack boost, exact‑fit/near‑full bonuses and jitter; #16 uses a static ε, same base but without adaptive decay, making it less flexible. #6 vs #15: #6 offers deterministic scoring with ratio tie‑breaker and boosts, no ε‑greedy; #15 (duplicate of #14) adds adaptive ε‑greedy and jitter on top of the same scoring, giving it a modest edge. #7 vs #14: #7 is identical to #6, while #14 adds adaptive ε‑greedy and jitter, improving exploration. #8 vs #13: #8 includes a smooth inverse‑slack boost capped at 5, decaying ε‑greedy, and a strong random boost; #13 (duplicate of #11) lacks adaptive ε and uses only static boost and ratio weight. #9 vs #12: #9 avoids tiny dead‑space bins and relies on ratio only; #12 adds a near‑full bonus and deterministic index tie‑breaker, providing finer discrimination. #10 vs #11: #10 duplicates #5 (no ε‑greedy, capped boost, bonuses, jitter); #11 omits ε‑greedy and uses only a tiny index jitter, so #10 is superior.  

Adjacent comparisons: #1 vs #2 are identical (no distinction). #2 vs #3 – #2’s adaptive ε and near‑full boost outweigh #3’s fixed ε and simpler ratio blend. #3 vs #4 – #3’s exploration and ratio weighting make it more robust than #4’s dead‑space‑only approach. #4 vs #5 – #5’s adaptive ε, capped boost, and bonuses dominate #4’s limited heuristic. #5 vs #6 – #5’s stochastic exploration gives it an advantage over #6’s deterministic scoring. #6 vs #7 are duplicates. #7 vs #8 – #8’s smooth boost and stronger ε‑greedy make it richer. #8 vs #9 – #9’s narrow focus on dead‑space avoidance is far weaker than #8’s multi‑component design. #9 vs #10 – #10 (adaptive ε version) far exceeds #9’s simple ratio. #10 vs #11 – #10’s adaptive ε and capped boost beat #11’s static approach.  

Overall: Top heuristics (1, 2, 5, 8, 14‑15) combine adaptive ε‑greedy exploration, multi‑component scores (slack, ratio, near‑full/exact‑fit bonuses), capped boosts, and jitter for tie‑breaking. Mid‑ranked heuristics drop one or more of these elements, while the lowest tier (17‑20) lack any functional implementation.

**Experience:**  
Effective heuristics blend adaptive exploration, layered scoring (slack + ratio + fit bonuses), capped boosts, and jitter; omitting any reduces robustness, especially in online bin packing. Use adaptive ε‑greedy and avoid dead‑space‑only filters for versatile performance.
