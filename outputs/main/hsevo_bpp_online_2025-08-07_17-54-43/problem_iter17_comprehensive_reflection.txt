- **Keywords:** deterministic, monotonic, ratio ranking, reproducibility.  
- **Advice:** use a single-pass ordering that ranks items by decreasing size‑to‑remaining capacity ratio; place items only when they satisfy the bin capacity; keep the ranking linear and fixed; set predefined thresholds before execution.  
- **Avoid:** any nondeterministic adjustments, complex normalizations (softmax, exponential scaling), multi‑stage pipelines, any extra ranking beyond the primary ratio.  
- **Explanation:** Simple monotonic rankings yield transparent bin selections, low overhead, and repeatable results, while avoiding heavy transformations preserves stability and performance.
