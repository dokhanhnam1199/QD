**Analysis:**  
Comparing #1 vs #20, we see that #1's adaptive ε‑decay, inverse‑slack scoring, and item‑specific near‑full/exact‑fit boosts provide a balanced exploration–exploitation trade‑off, while #20's static high ε, linear slack scoring, and global capacity threshold lead to excessive randomness and suboptimal bin selection;  
Comparing #2 vs #19, #2 is identical to the best heuristic, whereas #19 is incomplete (missing return), so #2 clearly outperforms;  
Comparing #1 vs #2, they are functionally identical, yielding no performance difference;  
Comparing #3 vs #4, both use fixed ε = 0.1, –slack scoring with equal near‑full and exact‑fit boosts, so no difference;  
Comparing #19 vs #20, #20, though fully implemented, still suffers from high ε and a less adaptive threshold; #19 is broken, making #20 the worst among the working heuristics;  
Overall: the ranking reflects a progression from simple, static scoring to adaptive, inverse‑slack scoring with item‑specific boosts, and the worst heuristics lack adaptive behavior or are incomplete.

**Experience:**  
Adaptive ε decay, inverse‑slack scoring, and item‑specific near‑full/exact‑fit boosts consistently outperform fixed‑ε, linear‑slack, or incomplete designs; prioritize dynamic exploration control and per‑item capacity tailoring in future heuristic construction.
