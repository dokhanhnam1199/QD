- **Advice**: Focus on iteratively refining item selection strategies based on real-time feedback. Incorporate systematic evaluation to dynamically adjust penalties for leftover space.
- **Avoid**: Static penalty structures, neglecting potential for adaptability, failing to reevaluate solutions periodically.
- **Explanation**: Dynamic adjustment of penalties and strategies allows the heuristic to better adapt to varying input scenarios. This avoids the pitfalls of static penalty structures, enhancing robustness and effectiveness in space utilization and item fit.
