- **Advice**: Focus on fine-tuning normalization techniques to handle variable bin sizes and item weights more effectively. Explore adaptive sigmoid functions to dynamically adjust penalties based on the current state of placement. Implement dynamic penalization to not only penalize leftover space but also underutilized bins.
- **Avoid**: Do not incorporate static or rigid space efficiency checks and item fit criteria as penalties within your heuristic. Avoid redundant calculations of penalties and inefficiency checks for the same placement scenarios.
- **Explanation**: By focusing on adaptive methods and avoiding static penalties, the heuristic can better respond to diverse and changing conditions, leading to more optimized solutions in bin placement. This approach aims to streamline the decision-making process, focusing computational resources on significant variables that impact bin packing efficiency.
