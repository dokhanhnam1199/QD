"**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) Heuristics 1st vs (worst) Heuristics 20th, we see that the best version includes a more nuanced approach by using a sigmoid dynamic midpoint based on the item size and a penalty calculation that ensures stability; the worst version has less fine-grained control over the sigmoid parameters and less adaptive penalty handling. 
(Second best) Heuristics 2nd vs (second worst) Heuristics 19th, we see minor differences in parameters affecting the steepness and midpoint, but the best version remains more adaptable and robust to different item sizes and remaining capacities.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see a refinement in the midpoint calculation and improved handling of penalties, indicating that dynamic sigmoid calculations significantly enhance performance.
(3rd) vs (4th) show identical logic, thus ranking equally; however, (3rd) still ranks above others due to adaptability in sigmoid steepness and midpoint.
Comparing (second worst) Heuristics 19th vs (worst) Heuristics 20th, the parameters differ slightly, but the fundamental adaptation mechanism and penalty calculation logic remains subpar in the worst version.
Overall:

**Experience:**
Normalization techniques combined with adaptive sigmoid functions and midpoint adjustments significantly improve heuristic accuracy and flexibility in bin selection."
