Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    item: float, \n    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, \n    sigmoid_steepness: float = 8.060154863007442, \n    max_cap_offset: float = 9.629999168879228e-06) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Prioritizes bins by combining normalized fit feasibility, dynamic sigmoid penalty, and adaptive item fit.\n    \"\"\"\n    ifbinsfit = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)  # Check if item fits in the bin\n    norm_remain_cap = (bins_remain_cap - np.min(bins_remain_cap)) / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) - np.min(bins_remain_cap) + max_cap_offset)\n    sigmoid_priority = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-sigmoid_steepness * (norm_remain_cap - (item / np.max(bins_remain_cap)))))  # Dynamic midpoint\n    penalty = (bins_remain_cap - item) / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + max_cap_offset)  # Adaptive penalty\n    return ifbinsfit * sigmoid_priority / (penalty + max_cap_offset)  # Combine feasibility, sigmoid, and penalty\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** Dynamic adjustments, adaptive functions, item-specific calculations, normalization\n- **Advice:** Implement problem-specific calculations that dynamically adjust according to current conditions and item characteristics to balance objectives effectively.\n- **Avoid:** Static penalization, unnecessary complexity, fixed methods, paradoxical adaptive factors\n- **Explanation:** By using dynamic and adaptive mechanisms, the heuristic can respond more accurately to the changing nature of the bin packing problem, improving its effectiveness without adding unnecessary complexity. Normalization should be continuously applied to ensure comparability and fair prioritization across varying scenarios.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
