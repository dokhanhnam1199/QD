**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics utilize detailed calculations for midpoint and penalty factor, ensuring nuanced bin prioritization. The worst heuristics lack variation, reuse similar calculations, and do not adapt well to different item sizes.
(Second best) vs (second worst) shows that adaptive parameters (penalty factor, midpoint) and sigmoid steepness play a significant role in distinguishing better heuristics.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see almost identical code with minor differences in constants, indicating the importance of fine-tuning parameters for optimal performance.
(3rd) vs (4th) further confirms that slight variations in penalty and midpoint calculation do not significantly impact the outcome, suggesting a need for more substantial alterations in heuristic design.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that there are no discernible differences in logic or parameters, reinforcing the notion that the core design of the heuristic is crucial.
Overall:

**Experience:**
Fine-tuned adaptive parameters and dynamic calculations for midpoint and penalty factors improve heuristic effectiveness. Variations in these components yield better performance, while identical logic produces suboptimal results. Prioritizing unique, adaptive design over minor parameter tweaks is essential for powerful heuristics.
