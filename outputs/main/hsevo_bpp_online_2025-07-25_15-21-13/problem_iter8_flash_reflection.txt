**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics use combinations of normalized fit feasibility, dynamic penalties, and sigmoid functions to balance between filling bins and minimizing leftover space, whereas the worst simply use an inverse of remaining capacity with a sinusoidal function, which does not dynamically adapt to item sizes or bin capacities. 

(Second best) vs (second worst), we observe that the second best uses a sigmoid function to dynamically adjust priorities, ensuring a balance between fit feasibility and leftover space minimization, whereas the second worst again uses a fixed inverse and sinusoidal function, ignoring dynamic adjustments.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see minimal differences, with both highly adaptive and using sigmoid functions; however, the first version slightly better exploits item size in its dynamic parameters.

(3rd) vs (4th), both use fixed methods without adaptability, with the third using sinusoidal adjustment which slightly outperforms the fourth due to its mathematical form balancing capacities better.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see little differentiation as both are non-adaptive and do not incorporate item size or dynamic adjustments in their methods.

Overall:

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, incorporate dynamic adjustments of fit feasibility and penalties, using adaptive functions like sigmoid to balance objectives and prioritize bins effectively. Avoid fixed methods and static penalties.
