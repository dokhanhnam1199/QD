{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDynamic parameter adjustment based on item and bin characteristics, along with normalized normalization, yields significant improvements in adaptive bin packing heuristics.\"\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nIncorporating space efficiency and item fit checks while penalizing leftover space in heuristics leads to more effective bin packing solutions.\n\nUse normalization, sigmoid functions, and dynamic penalization for better prioritization in bin placement heuristics. Avoid unnecessary complexity and redundant calculations.\n\nTo design better heuristics, incorporate dynamic adjustments of fit feasibility and penalties, using adaptive functions like sigmoid to balance objectives and prioritize bins effectively. Avoid fixed methods and static penalties.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
