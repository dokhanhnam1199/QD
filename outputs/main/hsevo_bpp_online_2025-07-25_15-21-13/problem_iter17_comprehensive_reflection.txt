- **Keywords:** Dynamic adjustments, adaptive functions, item-specific calculations, normalization
- **Advice:** Implement problem-specific calculations that dynamically adjust according to current conditions and item characteristics to balance objectives effectively.
- **Avoid:** Static penalization, unnecessary complexity, fixed methods, paradoxical adaptive factors
- **Explanation:** By using dynamic and adaptive mechanisms, the heuristic can respond more accurately to the changing nature of the bin packing problem, improving its effectiveness without adding unnecessary complexity. Normalization should be continuously applied to ensure comparability and fair prioritization across varying scenarios.
