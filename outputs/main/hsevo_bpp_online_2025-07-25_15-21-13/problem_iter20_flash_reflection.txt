**Analysis:**
Comparing **Heuristics 1st** vs **Heuristics 20th**, we see that **Heuristics 1st** introduces additional parameters (`sigmoid_steepness` and `max_cap_offset`) and a more nuanced calculation for penalties and probabilities, leading to a more fine-grained control over prioritization. In contrast, **Heuristics 20th** uses a fixed sigmoid steepness and a simplified penalty calculation.
**Second Best** vs **Second Worst** (Heuristics 2nd vs Heuristics 19th), **Heuristics 2nd** is simpler and avoids the complex dynamic adjustments and penalty factors seen in **Heuristics 19th**, which makes it more straightforward and easier to understand without a significant loss in effectiveness.
Comparing **Heuristics 1st** vs **Heuristics 2nd**, **Heuristics 1st** includes two sigmoid penalties and a penalty factor, which allow for more detailed and adaptive decision-making, whereas **Heuristics 2nd** primarily relies on a single sigmoid penalty adjusted with the item size.
**Heuristics 3rd** vs **Heuristics 18th** highlights that **Heuristics 3rd** has an additional penalty factor and a more comprehensive penalty adjustment, providing more precise tuning of the priority scores.
Comparing **Heuristics 17th** vs **Worst** (**Heuristics 20th**), **Heuristics 17th** integrates a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that considers the current item size relative to the average bin capacity, providing a more refined adaptability and priority scoring system.
Overall: The top-ranked heuristics tend to include more parameters and mechanisms for adaptive adjustment, whereas the lower-ranked heuristics are simpler with fewer adaptive elements.

**Experience:** Design better heuristics using adaptive mechanisms and more tunable parameters to enhance sensitivity and decision-making精度.
