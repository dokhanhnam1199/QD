**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics consider the remaining capacity and efficiently manage space to minimize waste, which is crucial for optimization. In contrast, the worst heuristics apply a sinusoidal function that unnecessarily complicates the simplicity of filling bins based on capacity and space left. 
(second best) vs (second worst) reveals that the second best maintains a clear priority on minimizing leftover space and fits within the remaining capacity well, whereas the second worst does not account for capacity-based prioritization effectively.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both prioritize based on remaining capacity but the first adds a nuanced consideration of leftover space, improving efficiency over the second.
(3rd) vs (4th) shows improvements when the fourth method introduces a penalty for leftover space, demonstrating the benefit of adaptive heuristics over static capacity-based ones.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst at least checks if the item can fit within the bin, providing a basic layer of functionality the worst lacks.
Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors like capacity, item fit, and leftover space effectively, enhancing efficiency in bin packing.

**Experience:**
Incorporating space efficiency and item fit checks while penalizing leftover space in heuristics leads to more effective bin packing solutions.
