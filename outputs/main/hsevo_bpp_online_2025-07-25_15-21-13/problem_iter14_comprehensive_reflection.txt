- **Advice:** Integrate dynamic adjustments based on current problem state and use sigmoid functions to smoothly balance penalties and bin prioritization.
- **Avoid:** Fixed penalties, redundant calculations, incorporating space efficiency checks specifically as penalties, and overly simplistic penalties.
- **Explanation:** Dynamic adjustments ensure the heuristic remains responsive to changes in the problem landscape, while sigmoid functions provide a nuanced way to penalize inefficiency or penalize space in a way that promotes adaptability over rigidity. Avoiding fixed penalties and redundant calculations prevents the heuristic from becoming ineffective or overly complex.
