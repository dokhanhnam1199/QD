Prioritize fitting bins with minimal slack. Softmax enables flexible preference mapping.
Prioritize tight fits, but consider a bonus for larger capacities for future flexibility.
Prioritize bins with minimal *positive* remaining capacity for a tighter fit.
Prioritize tight fits, use smooth transitions like sigmoid, and avoid abrupt changes or randomness in deterministic scenarios.
Prioritize minimal waste (tightest fit) over maximum remaining capacity.
Prioritize tighter fits for better bin packing efficiency.
Experiment with sigmoid parameters and explore alternative smooth ranking functions for better prioritization.
Prioritize bins with minimal slack after packing. Avoid unnecessary exploration.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after placement. Adjust sigmoid scaling for sensitivity.
Prioritize bins that minimize leftover space, favoring tighter fits.
