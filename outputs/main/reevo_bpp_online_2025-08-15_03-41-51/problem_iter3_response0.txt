[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` function uses an epsilon-greedy approach, which is a reinforcement learning strategy. For a direct priority function in the context of heuristics, it might be more appropriate to directly define the priority based on bin properties without explicit exploration probability.

The reflection suggests prioritizing bins with minimal remaining capacity (tightest fits), using smooth ranking functions like sigmoid, and considering a small bonus for larger remaining capacities.

Let's design a new priority function, `priority_v2`, that directly implements these ideas:

1.  **Tightest Fit Component:** Bins with remaining capacity `r` that is just enough to fit the item (`r >= item`) should have a high priority. The "best fit" (smallest `r - item`) should be prioritized.
2.  **Smooth Ranking:** Instead of binary high/low priority, we can use a function that smoothly maps remaining capacity to a priority score. A sigmoid function centered around `item` capacity could work.
3.  **Flexibility Bonus:** A small bonus for bins with significantly larger remaining capacities can be added to encourage leaving space for potentially larger future items, balancing immediate "best fit" with future "flexibility".

**Plan for `priority_v2`:**

*   **Input:** `item` (float), `bins_remain_cap` (np.ndarray).
*   **Output:** `priorities` (np.ndarray).

*   **Step 1: Identify Valid Bins:** Create a mask for bins where `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
*   **Step 2: Calculate Base Priority (Tightest Fit):** For valid bins, calculate a priority based on how close their remaining capacity is to the item size. A common heuristic is `1 / (remaining_capacity - item + epsilon)` where epsilon is a small value to avoid division by zero. Alternatively, use a sigmoid-like function that peaks when `remaining_capacity - item` is small. Let's use `1 / (remaining_capacity - item + 1)` to keep values positive and bounded without needing a strict sigmoid initially, as it's simpler and often effective.
*   **Step 3: Add Flexibility Bonus:** For bins with significantly *larger* remaining capacity, we might want to give them a small boost. This is counter-intuitive to "tightest fit" but aligns with the reflection's suggestion of balancing. A simple way is to add a small value proportional to `(remaining_capacity - item)`. However, this could favor very empty bins too much. A better approach might be to give a small bonus if `remaining_capacity` is "large" (e.g., greater than average or a fixed threshold). Let's try a gentle bonus for bins with remaining capacity greater than `item * 1.5` or similar. A simpler interpretation of the reflection might be to favor bins that are *not too full* but still fit, to keep some wiggle room. Let's re-interpret the "bonus for larger remaining capacities" as a slight *reduction* in priority for the absolute tightest fits, making slightly looser fits competitive.
    *   Revisiting the reflection: "Consider a small bonus for larger remaining capacities to balance immediate tightness with future flexibility." This means if a bin has *much more* space than needed, it might be slightly more attractive than one that *just* fits, if the latter is too tight.

*   **Revised Plan for `priority_v2`:**
    1.  **Filter:** Identify bins that can fit the item (`bins_remain_cap >= item`). For bins that cannot fit, priority is 0.
    2.  **Tightness Score:** For fitting bins, calculate a score that favors smaller `remaining_capacity - item`. Let's use `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[valid_mask] - item + 1.0)`. This gives higher scores to tighter fits.
    3.  **Flexibility Score:** Introduce a bonus for bins that have significantly more remaining capacity than just fitting the item. This could be a small additive term. Let's say if `bins_remain_cap > item * 2`, add a small bonus. A smooth way to do this is with a sigmoid-like function that *increases* with remaining capacity after a certain point. For simplicity, let's add a small constant if `bins_remain_cap` is significantly larger than `item`. Example: `flex_bonus = 0.1` if `bins_remain_cap > item * 1.5` else `0.0`.
    4.  **Combine:** Total priority = Tightness Score + Flexibility Bonus.
    5.  **Normalization:** Normalize the final priorities.

Let's refine the "flexibility bonus" aspect. The reflection mentions "balancing immediate tightness with future flexibility." This suggests that while tight fits are good, bins that are *too* tight might leave no room for future items. Thus, a bin that fits the item well but leaves some reasonable space might be preferable over one that leaves almost no space.

**Revised Plan `priority_v2` (Focus on smooth ranking and balancing):**

1.  **Filter:** Identify bins that can fit the item (`bins_remain_cap >= item`). Priority is 0 for others.
2.  **Smooth Fit Score:** For fitting bins, use a function that maps `remaining_capacity` to a priority. A sigmoid-like function that peaks when `remaining_capacity` is slightly larger than `item` might be good.
    *   Consider the value `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want high priority when `x` is small, but not necessarily zero. A Gaussian-like function centered slightly above 0, or a smoothed inverse could work.
    *   Let's try a function like `exp(- (bins_remain_cap - item - C)^2 / (2 * sigma^2))`, where `C` is a small buffer (e.g., 1 unit of capacity) and `sigma` controls the width. This would prioritize bins with remaining capacity around `item + C`.
    *   Alternatively, a simpler approach: prioritize bins based on `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1)` for tightness, and add a small bonus for "flexibility".

Let's try this combination:
Priority = `weight_tightness * (1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1)) + weight_flexibility * (bins_remain_cap / BIN_SIZE)`
Where `BIN_SIZE` is the capacity of a full bin. The second term encourages using bins that are not overly full.

Let's simplify this. The reflection mentions "minimal remaining capacity (tightest fits)" and "small bonus for larger remaining capacities".
This implies a score that increases with tightness up to a point, then possibly decreases or plateaus.

**Final Strategy for `priority_v2`:**
1.  Identify bins that can fit the item. Set priority to 0 for others.
2.  For fitting bins, calculate priority based on `remaining_capacity`.
    *   **Tightness Component:** A score that is high when `remaining_capacity` is close to `item`. Let's use `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[valid_mask] - item + 1.0)`.
    *   **Flexibility Component:** A score that is high when `bins_remain_cap` is "moderately large". This balances not being too tight, but not being too empty either. A sigmoid function could model this. Let's use a Gaussian-like function centered around a capacity slightly larger than `item`. E.g., `exp(-((bins_remain_cap[valid_mask] - TARGET_CAPACITY) / SIGMA)**2)`, where `TARGET_CAPACITY` is maybe `item * 1.5` and `SIGMA` controls the spread.

Let's combine these smoothly.
The priority should be high for bins where `r` is slightly larger than `item`.
Consider `f(r) = exp(- (r - (item + buffer))^2 / (2 * sigma^2))` where `buffer` is a small positive value (e.g., 1) and `sigma` controls sensitivity. This peaks at `item + buffer`.
This naturally balances tightness and flexibility. A bin that is *just* large enough might get a slightly lower score than one that fits comfortably.

Let's define `priority_v2` using this approach. We'll need a fixed `BIN_CAPACITY` to normalize the 'flexibility' aspect if we want to use relative remaining capacity. Let's assume a `BIN_CAPACITY` is implicitly known or can be passed. For now, let's base it on the item size.

**Refined Strategy:**
1.  Identify bins that can fit the item. Priority is 0 for others.
2.  For fitting bins, calculate priority using a function that favors `r` slightly larger than `item`. A Gaussian-like kernel centered at `item + C` (where `C` is a small constant, e.g., 1) seems appropriate.
    `priority = exp(-((r - (item + C)) / sigma)^2)`
    Here, `r` is `bins_remain_cap`.

Let's try this. We need to choose `C` and `sigma`.
`C`: A small buffer, e.g., 1.0. This means we slightly prefer bins with capacity `item + 1` over bins with capacity `item`.
`sigma`: Controls how sensitive the priority is to the difference. A smaller `sigma` makes the peak sharper. Let's try `sigma = 2.0`.
