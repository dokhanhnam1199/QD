Prioritize tightest fits. Avoid complex combinations; simplicity often yields better results.
Prioritize tight fits, use smooth functions, and balance with flexibility.
Tune sigmoid's steepness and ideal gap for better bin packing priorities.
Prioritize tight fits, but consider flexibility. Normalize scores and tune weights.
**Normalize features before combining; tune weights and sigmoid steepness.**
Balance tight fits, capacity bonuses, and exploration. Use clear normalization.
Balance tightness with flexibility, use softmax for probabilities, and consider scaling factors.
Prioritize tight fits, experiment with tunable parameters for complex strategies.
Prioritize tight fits, balance with future flexibility, and use scaled, stable transformations.
Tune sigmoid parameters (steepness, ideal gap) for flexible fitting.
