Focus on the goal: minimize wasted space for tighter fits.
Tune sigmoid parameters; prioritize slight positive gaps for future packing flexibility.
Prioritize minimizing remaining capacity, then consider flexibility. Softmax is a good approach.
Prioritize strict fits, balance exploration/exploitation, and consider adaptive temperature.
Prioritize small residual capacities; explicitly handle un-fittable bins.
Tune sigmoid parameters for desired tightness and flexibility trade-off.
Focus on minimizing slack for tighter fits. Avoid complex smoothing for simpler, effective heuristics.
Prioritize tight fits. Softmax-like scoring encourages better fits without absolute reliance on small margins.
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity. Stabilize softmax with score subtraction.
Tune parameters, balance exploration/exploitation, use normalized values, and sigmoid for smooth prioritization.
