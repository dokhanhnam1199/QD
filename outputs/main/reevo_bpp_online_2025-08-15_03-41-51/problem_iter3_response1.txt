[Prior reflection]
The previous `priority_v1` function implements an Epsilon-Greedy strategy, which is a valid exploration-exploitation approach. However, the "reflection" specifically suggests prioritizing bins with minimal remaining capacity (tightest fits) using smooth ranking functions like sigmoid, and considering a small bonus for larger remaining capacities to balance immediate tightness with future flexibility. The current implementation of "best fit" directly targets the minimum difference, which is a discrete choice, not a smooth ranking. Also, there's no explicit consideration for future flexibility (larger remaining capacities).

Here's a plan for `priority_v2`:
1.  **Smooth Ranking for Tightest Fit:** Instead of directly picking the minimum difference, we'll use a sigmoid-like function. The input to the sigmoid will be a measure of "tightness." A good measure is `1 - (item_size / remaining_capacity)` or `remaining_capacity - item_size`. A smaller difference (tighter fit) should result in a higher sigmoid output. We need to ensure the sigmoid is parameterized correctly to reflect this. A simple approach could be `sigmoid(k * (item_size - remaining_capacity))`, where `k` is a steepness parameter. Larger negative values of `(item_size - remaining_capacity)` mean a tighter fit.

2.  **Bonus for Future Flexibility:** We can add a term that rewards bins with *more* remaining capacity. This could be a simple additive bonus or part of the overall score calculation. A weighted sum of "tightness score" and "flexibility score" might be appropriate. The flexibility score could be proportional to `remaining_capacity`.

3.  **Handling Unfit Bins:** Bins that cannot fit the item must have a priority of 0 (or very low).

4.  **Parameter Tuning:** The sigmoid's steepness (`k`) and the weight given to flexibility need to be tunable parameters.

Let's refine the "tightness score": A bin is "tight" if `remaining_capacity` is just slightly larger than `item`. So, `remaining_capacity - item` being small is good.
Consider a function `f(x) = -x` for `x = remaining_capacity - item`. This makes smaller (more negative) values better. Applying a sigmoid: `sigmoid(k * (remaining_capacity - item))`. For `remaining_capacity - item` close to 0, this is `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`. For `remaining_capacity - item` very negative (much larger than item), it's close to 1. For `remaining_capacity - item` very positive (much larger than item), it's close to 0. This seems inverted.

Let's reconsider: we want smaller `remaining_capacity - item` (when `remaining_capacity >= item`) to have higher priority.
Let `diff = remaining_capacity - item`. We want smaller positive `diff` values to be prioritized.
A function like `1 / (1 + diff)` maps `diff=0` to 1, `diff=1` to `0.5`, `diff=large` to near 0. This is a smooth decreasing function.
Alternatively, consider `exp(-k * diff)`. `diff=0` gives 1, `diff=1` gives `exp(-k)`.
Or, using the sigmoid: `sigmoid(k * (1 - diff / max_possible_diff))`. This requires normalizing `diff`.

Let's try a combination:
Priority = `w_tight * tightness_score + w_flex * flexibility_score`

`tightness_score`: want small `remaining_capacity - item`.
Let `gap = remaining_capacity - item`.
A score that is high for small positive gaps: `exp(-k_tight * gap)` for `gap >= 0`.

`flexibility_score`: want large `remaining_capacity`.
Score: `remaining_capacity`.

So, `priority = w_tight * exp(-k_tight * max(0, remaining_capacity - item)) + w_flex * remaining_capacity`

The `max(0, ...)` handles bins that don't fit. For those, the tightness score contribution is 0.

Let's simplify the sigmoid approach.
If `residual = remaining_capacity - item`, we want to maximize `1 / (1 + exp(-k * residual))` if we want small residuals to be good.
`f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * x))`
For `x = remaining_capacity - item`:
If `residual` is small positive (e.g., 0.1), `f(0.1)` is high.
If `residual` is large positive (e.g., 10), `f(10)` is low.
If `residual` is negative (item doesn't fit), `f(-ve)` is very low.

This sigmoid maps `(-inf, inf)` to `(0, 1)`.
Let's try `sigmoid(k * (item - remaining_capacity))`.
`x = item - remaining_capacity`.
If `remaining_capacity` is just enough for `item` (e.g., `remaining_capacity = item + 0.1`), then `x = -0.1`. `sigmoid(-0.1 * k)` is close to 0.5.
If `remaining_capacity` is much larger than `item` (e.g., `remaining_capacity = item + 10`), then `x = -10`. `sigmoid(-10 * k)` is very close to 0.
If `item` is larger than `remaining_capacity` (e.g., `remaining_capacity = item - 1`), then `x = 1`. `sigmoid(k)` is close to 1. This is inverted!

Let's try `sigmoid(k * (remaining_capacity - item))`.
`x = remaining_capacity - item`.
If `remaining_capacity` is just enough (e.g., `remaining_capacity = item + 0.1`), `x = 0.1`. `sigmoid(0.1 * k)` is close to 0.5.
If `remaining_capacity` is much larger (e.g., `remaining_capacity = item + 10`), `x = 10`. `sigmoid(10 * k)` is close to 1.
If `item` is larger than `remaining_capacity` (e.g., `remaining_capacity = item - 1`), `x = -1`. `sigmoid(-k)` is close to 0.

So, `sigmoid(k * (remaining_capacity - item))` is high for bins with large remaining capacity. This is the flexibility part.
To get the tightness, we want small `remaining_capacity - item`.

Let's define `priority(bin_i) = w_tight * tightness_score_i + w_flex * flexibility_score_i`.

`tightness_score_i`: Use `1 / (1 + exp(-k_tight * (capacity_limit - remaining_capacity_i)))`. This gives higher score for smaller `remaining_capacity_i`.
We also need to ensure `remaining_capacity_i >= item`.

Let's define the score directly on the *gap* `g = remaining_capacity - item`.
We want to prioritize small positive gaps.
Smooth function for small positive gaps: `exp(-k * g)` for `g >= 0`.
This maps `g=0` to 1, `g=1` to `exp(-k)`, `g=large` to 0.

So, `tightness_score = exp(-k_tight * max(0, remaining_capacity - item))`
And `flexibility_score = remaining_capacity`.

Combine them:
`priority = w_tight * exp(-k_tight * max(0, remaining_capacity - item)) + w_flex * remaining_capacity`

The parameters `k_tight`, `w_tight`, `w_flex` will control the behavior.
A simple sigmoid might be easier to reason about.

Let's try:
`tightness_score = sigmoid(k_tight * (item - remaining_capacity))`
This is high when `item > remaining_capacity` (item cannot fit).
This is low when `item << remaining_capacity` (large gap).
This is around 0.5 when `item = remaining_capacity`.

We want high priority for:
1. Bins where `remaining_capacity >= item`
2. Among those, bins where `remaining_capacity - item` is small.
3. Bins with larger `remaining_capacity` (flexibility).

Let's use the sigmoid to map the *suitability* of the fit.
`suitability = remaining_capacity - item`.
We want small positive suitability values to be preferred.

Consider `score_fit = sigmoid(k_fit * (max_cap - (remaining_capacity - item)))` where `max_cap` is some notion of maximum possible gap. This is getting complex.

Let's simplify: Prioritize bins that are "nearly full" but can still fit the item.
And also give some weight to bins that are "nearly empty" but have lots of capacity.

Let's re-read: "Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity (tightest fits). Use smooth ranking functions like sigmoid, adjusting parameters for sensitivity. Consider a small bonus for larger remaining capacities to balance immediate tightness with future flexibility."

Okay, the reflection is suggesting a weighted sum of two components:
1.  **Tightness:** Small `remaining_capacity - item`.
2.  **Flexibility:** Large `remaining_capacity`.

Let's try to use a sigmoid for the *tightness* component.
A suitable input for sigmoid for tightness would be something that is negative for tight fits and positive for loose fits.
Let `gap = remaining_capacity - item`.
We want small `gap`. So `item - gap` (which is `item - (remaining_capacity - item) = 2*item - remaining_capacity`) is large when `gap` is small.
Or simpler: `-(remaining_capacity - item) = item - remaining_capacity`.
This value is positive if item is larger than capacity (unfit), zero if exact fit, negative if loose fit.
We want tight fits (small positive gap) to have high priority.

Consider the function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(k*x))` for `x = remaining_capacity - item`.
If `remaining_capacity - item = 0`, `f(0) = 0.5`.
If `remaining_capacity - item = small positive`, `f(small positive)` is slightly less than 0.5.
If `remaining_capacity - item = large positive`, `f(large positive)` is close to 0.
If `remaining_capacity - item = negative`, `f(negative)` is close to 1.

This function `1 / (1 + exp(k*(remaining_capacity - item)))` gives high scores to bins that *do not* fit the item or fit it loosely. This is also inverted.

The sigmoid `S(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` maps `(-inf, inf)` to `(0, 1)`.
-   If `x` is large positive, `S(x)` is close to 1.
-   If `x` is large negative, `S(x)` is close to 0.

We want `remaining_capacity - item` to be small and positive for tightness.
Let's map `remaining_capacity - item` to a scale where small positive values are mapped to large positive inputs for the sigmoid.

Let `gap = remaining_capacity - item`.
We want to prioritize `gap` near 0 (from the positive side).
Consider an input to sigmoid like `k_tight * (1 - gap)`. If `gap=0`, input is `k_tight`. If `gap=1`, input is `k_tight-1`. This is not ideal as it's decreasing.

Let's try defining the priority as a sum of two components:
1.  **Tightness component:** `T = exp(-k_tight * max(0, remaining_capacity - item))`
    This gives 1 for exact fit, values < 1 for loose fits, and 0 for unfit bins.
2.  **Flexibility component:** `F = remaining_capacity`
    This is simply the remaining capacity.

The combined priority could be:
`P = w_tight * T + w_flex * F`

Let's try to use sigmoid for tightness specifically.
We want to prioritize bins where `remaining_capacity - item` is minimal (and non-negative).
Let `residual = remaining_capacity - item`.
We can map this `residual` to a score using a sigmoid.
A function that maps `residual` (small positive) to high sigmoid input:
Let `score_input = k * (C - residual)` where `C` is some reference value, or `k * (1 / (1 + residual))` or `k * exp(-residual)`.

Let's use `score_input = -k * residual`.
If `residual = 0`, `score_input = 0`. Sigmoid gives 0.5.
If `residual = 0.1`, `score_input = -0.1k`. Sigmoid gives < 0.5.
If `residual = -0.1` (item larger), `score_input = 0.1k`. Sigmoid gives > 0.5.

This is still inverted.

How about `sigmoid(k * (1 - (remaining_capacity / bin_capacity)))` for tightness?
This would be good for bins that are nearly full. But it doesn't consider the item size directly.

Let's go back to basics. We need to decide *which* bins are eligible.
Eligibility: `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
For eligible bins, we want to score them.
Scoring:
-   Small `bins_remain_cap - item` is good (tightness).
-   Large `bins_remain_cap` is good (flexibility).

Let's define a score for eligible bins:
`score(bin_i) = w_tight * sigmoid(k_tight * (item - bins_remain_cap[i])) + w_flex * sigmoid(k_flex * bins_remain_cap[i])`

-   `sigmoid(k_tight * (item - bins_remain_cap[i]))`:
    -   If `bins_remain_cap[i] = item`, input is 0, sigmoid is 0.5.
    -   If `bins_remain_cap[i] = item + delta` (tight fit), input is `-delta * k_tight`. Sigmoid is < 0.5.
    -   If `bins_remain_cap[i] = item + large_delta` (loose fit), input is `-large_delta * k_tight`. Sigmoid is near 0.
    This seems to prioritize bins with `bins_remain_cap[i]` *smaller* than `item`, which is wrong.

Let's try mapping `(remaining_capacity - item)` to be high for small positive values.
Consider `g = remaining_capacity - item`.
We can use `1 - sigmoid(k * g)`.
If `g = 0`, `1 - sigmoid(0) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5`.
If `g = small positive`, `1 - sigmoid(k * small_pos)` is slightly > 0.5.
If `g = large positive`, `1 - sigmoid(k * large_pos)` is close to 0.
This works for tightness if we ignore the `max(0, ...)` part for a moment.

So, `tightness_score = 1 - sigmoid(k_tight * max(0, remaining_capacity - item))`
And `flexibility_score = sigmoid(k_flex * remaining_capacity)` (using sigmoid to keep scores bounded and smooth).

Combined priority:
`priority = w_tight * (1 - sigmoid(k_tight * max(0, remaining_capacity - item))) + w_flex * sigmoid(k_flex * remaining_capacity)`

Let's test this.
Assume `item = 5`. `bin_capacity_limit = 10`.
Bins: `[6, 7, 9, 11]` (remaining capacities)

Bin 1: `rem_cap = 6`. `gap = 1`.
  Tightness: `1 - sigmoid(k_tight * 1)`. If `k_tight=2`, `1 - sigmoid(2) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12`.
  Flexibility: `sigmoid(k_flex * 6)`. If `k_flex=1`, `sigmoid(6) = 0.997`.
  Priority: `w_tight * 0.12 + w_flex * 0.997`.

Bin 2: `rem_cap = 7`. `gap = 2`.
  Tightness: `1 - sigmoid(k_tight * 2)`. If `k_tight=2`, `1 - sigmoid(4) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02`.
  Flexibility: `sigmoid(k_flex * 7)`. If `k_flex=1`, `sigmoid(7) = 0.999`.
  Priority: `w_tight * 0.02 + w_flex * 0.999`.

Bin 3: `rem_cap = 9`. `gap = 4`.
  Tightness: `1 - sigmoid(k_tight * 4)`. If `k_tight=2`, `1 - sigmoid(8) = 1 - 0.999 = 0.001`.
  Flexibility: `sigmoid(k_flex * 9)`. If `k_flex=1`, `sigmoid(9) = 0.9999`.
  Priority: `w_tight * 0.001 + w_flex * 0.9999`.

Bin 4: `rem_cap = 11`. Item `5`. Bin cannot fit. `max(0, 11-5)` is `6`.
  Tightness: `1 - sigmoid(k_tight * 6)`. If `k_tight=2`, `1 - sigmoid(12) = 1 - ~1 = ~0`.
  Flexibility: `sigmoid(k_flex * 11)`. If `k_flex=1`, `sigmoid(11) = ~1`.
  Priority: `w_tight * 0 + w_flex * ~1`.

This seems to prioritize flexibility too much for unfit bins.
We need to ensure unfit bins have 0 priority.

Revised approach:
1. Filter bins that cannot fit the item. Set their priority to 0.
2. For eligible bins, calculate a composite score.

Let `eligible_bins_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item`.
Let `eligible_rem_cap = bins_remain_cap[eligible_bins_mask]`.

For these eligible bins, calculate `gap = eligible_rem_cap - item`.
We want to prioritize small `gap`.
Let's use `score_tight = sigmoid(k_tight * (1 - gap))`.
If `gap=0`, `score_tight = sigmoid(k_tight)`.
If `gap=small_positive`, `score_tight` is less than `sigmoid(k_tight)`.
If `gap=large_positive`, `score_tight` is close to 0.

This is still inverted for tightness.
Let's go back to `1 - sigmoid(k * gap)`.
`tightness_score = 1 - sigmoid(k_tight * gap)`
`flexibility_score = sigmoid(k_flex * eligible_rem_cap)`

`priorities_eligible = w_tight * (1 - sigmoid(k_tight * gap)) + w_flex * sigmoid(k_flex * eligible_rem_cap)`

Let's try `k_tight=2`, `k_flex=0.5`, `w_tight=1`, `w_flex=0.5`.
Item = 5, Bin capacity limit = 10.
Bins: `[6, 7, 9, 11]`

Bin 1: `rem_cap = 6`. `gap = 1`.
  `tight_score = 1 - sigmoid(2*1) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*6) = sigmoid(3) = 0.95`.
  `priority = 1 * 0.12 + 0.5 * 0.95 = 0.12 + 0.475 = 0.595`.

Bin 2: `rem_cap = 7`. `gap = 2`.
  `tight_score = 1 - sigmoid(2*2) = 1 - sigmoid(4) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*7) = sigmoid(3.5) = 0.97`.
  `priority = 1 * 0.02 + 0.5 * 0.97 = 0.02 + 0.485 = 0.505`.

Bin 3: `rem_cap = 9`. `gap = 4`.
  `tight_score = 1 - sigmoid(2*4) = 1 - sigmoid(8) = 1 - 0.999 = 0.001`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*9) = sigmoid(4.5) = 0.989`.
  `priority = 1 * 0.001 + 0.5 * 0.989 = 0.001 + 0.4945 = 0.4955`.

Bin 4: `rem_cap = 11`. Unfit. Priority = 0.

The priorities are decreasing: 0.595, 0.505, 0.4955.
This means Bin 1 (tightest fit) gets highest priority, which is what we want.
Bin 3 (loosest fit) gets lowest priority among eligible bins.

The `k` parameters control the sensitivity.
`k_tight` controls how quickly the tightness score drops as the gap increases. A larger `k_tight` means smaller gaps are much more favored.
`k_flex` controls how quickly the flexibility score saturates. A larger `k_flex` means that even moderately large capacities get nearly maximum flexibility score.

Let's set some default parameters.
`k_tight = 3.0` (makes the sigmoid steep around gap=0)
`k_flex = 0.5` (allows flexibility score to grow more gradually)
`w_tight = 0.7` (emphasize tightness slightly more)
`w_flex = 0.3`

Let's re-calculate with these new params.
Item = 5, Bin capacity limit = 10.
Bins: `[6, 7, 9, 11]`

Bin 1: `rem_cap = 6`. `gap = 1`.
  `tight_score = 1 - sigmoid(3*1) = 1 - sigmoid(3) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*6) = sigmoid(3) = 0.95`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.05 + 0.3 * 0.95 = 0.035 + 0.285 = 0.32`.

Bin 2: `rem_cap = 7`. `gap = 2`.
  `tight_score = 1 - sigmoid(3*2) = 1 - sigmoid(6) = 1 - 0.997 = 0.003`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*7) = sigmoid(3.5) = 0.97`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.003 + 0.3 * 0.97 = 0.0021 + 0.291 = 0.2931`.

Bin 3: `rem_cap = 9`. `gap = 4`.
  `tight_score = 1 - sigmoid(3*4) = 1 - sigmoid(12) = 1 - ~1 = ~0`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*9) = sigmoid(4.5) = 0.989`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0 + 0.3 * 0.989 = 0.2967`.

Bin 4: `rem_cap = 11`. Unfit. Priority = 0.

The priorities are: 0.32, 0.2931, 0.2967.
The tightest bin (gap 1) gets the highest priority.
The next bins have similar priorities, with the slightly looser gap (gap 2) getting slightly lower priority than the loosest gap (gap 4). This is because the flexibility score for gap=4 is higher, and `w_flex` is not zero. This behavior seems reasonable.

Need to implement the sigmoid function and use numpy operations.

Testing the `exp(-k * gaps)` approach for tightness.
`k_tight=3.0`, `k_flex=0.5`, `w_tight=0.7`, `w_flex=0.3`.
Item = 5, Bin capacity limit = 10.
Bins: `[6, 7, 9, 11]`

Bin 1: `rem_cap = 6`. `gap = 1`.
  `tight_score = exp(-3*1) = exp(-3) = 0.0498`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*6) = sigmoid(3) = 0.95`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.0498 + 0.3 * 0.95 = 0.03486 + 0.285 = 0.31986`.

Bin 2: `rem_cap = 7`. `gap = 2`.
  `tight_score = exp(-3*2) = exp(-6) = 0.00248`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*7) = sigmoid(3.5) = 0.97`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.00248 + 0.3 * 0.97 = 0.001736 + 0.291 = 0.292736`.

Bin 3: `rem_cap = 9`. `gap = 4`.
  `tight_score = exp(-3*4) = exp(-12) = 0.0000061`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*9) = sigmoid(4.5) = 0.989`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.0000061 + 0.3 * 0.989 = 0.00000427 + 0.2967 = 0.296704`.

Bin 4: `rem_cap = 11`. Unfit. Priority = 0.

Priorities: 0.31986, 0.292736, 0.296704.
This order is: Bin 1 > Bin 3 > Bin 2.
The tightest bin (gap 1) has the highest priority.
The loosest bin (gap 4) has the second highest.
The intermediate gap bin (gap 2) has the lowest.
This also seems reasonable and perhaps more intuitive for "tightness" to decay faster.

The reflection asked for "smooth ranking functions like sigmoid".
Using `exp(-k * gap)` is not a sigmoid directly, but it's a smooth, monotonically decreasing function.
We could wrap `exp(-k*gap)` in a sigmoid if we wanted to squash its output between 0 and 1.
`tightness_score = sigmoid(k_tight_scaled * (exp(-k_tight * gaps) - offset))`
This adds complexity.

Let's reconsider the sigmoid for tightness.
We want a function `f(gap)` that is high for `gap` near 0.
`sigmoid(k * (1 - gap))`?
If `gap = 0`, `sigmoid(k)`.
If `gap = 1`, `sigmoid(k-1)`.
If `gap = large`, `sigmoid(-large) -> 0`.
This works if `k` is large enough.

Let's try `sigmoid(k_tight * (1 - gaps))`.
`k_tight=3.0`, `k_flex=0.5`, `w_tight=0.7`, `w_flex=0.3`.
Item = 5, Bin capacity limit = 10.
Bins: `[6, 7, 9, 11]`

Bin 1: `rem_cap = 6`. `gap = 1`.
  `tight_score = sigmoid(3 * (1 - 1)) = sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*6) = sigmoid(3) = 0.95`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.5 + 0.3 * 0.95 = 0.35 + 0.285 = 0.635`.

Bin 2: `rem_cap = 7`. `gap = 2`.
  `tight_score = sigmoid(3 * (1 - 2)) = sigmoid(-3) = 0.047`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*7) = sigmoid(3.5) = 0.97`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.047 + 0.3 * 0.97 = 0.0329 + 0.291 = 0.3239`.

Bin 3: `rem_cap = 9`. `gap = 4`.
  `tight_score = sigmoid(3 * (1 - 4)) = sigmoid(-9) = 0.00012`.
  `flex_score = sigmoid(0.5*9) = sigmoid(4.5) = 0.989`.
  `priority = 0.7 * 0.00012 + 0.3 * 0.989 = 0.000084 + 0.2967 = 0.296784`.

This gives priorities: 0.635, 0.3239, 0.296784.
This order (Bin 1 > Bin 2 > Bin 3) is also good, prioritizing the tightest fit.
The scores are also more spread out. This seems like a better implementation of the reflection using sigmoid.

Let's finalize the function based on this last approach.
The `k_tight` here effectively scales the gap. A larger `k_tight` will make the `sigmoid(k * (1 - gap))` drop faster as `gap` increases.

The `flexibility_score` uses `sigmoid(k_flex * eligible_rem_cap)`. This means larger remaining capacities get a score approaching 1.

One small detail: The reflection mentions "adjusting parameters for sensitivity". The chosen parameters `k_tight=3.0`, `k_flex=0.5`, `w_tight=0.7`, `w_flex=0.3` are examples. These would ideally be tunable.
