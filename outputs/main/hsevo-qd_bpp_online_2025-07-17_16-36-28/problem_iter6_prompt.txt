Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines best aspects of v0 and v1 to create effective heuristic.\"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap - item >= 0\n\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 # Fits check\n    wasted_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n    priorities[valid_bins] += 1.0 / (1e-6 + wasted_space) # Minimize wasted space\n\n    mean_cap = np.mean(bins_remain_cap)\n    half_full_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item - mean_cap/2)\n    priorities[valid_bins] += 1.0 / (1e-6 + half_full_diff) # Target Half-full\n\n    scaled_bins = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]**2\n    priorities[valid_bins] += scaled_bins / (np.sum(scaled_bins) + 1e-6) # Spread items\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] += np.random.rand(np.sum(valid_bins)) * 0.01 # Break ties\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to create a more potent guide for designing heuristics:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, robust exploration, problem-specific knowledge, computational efficiency.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on *learning* from iterations. Adapt heuristic strategies based on problem instance characteristics and performance feedback. Rigorously test and validate.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Blind parameter tuning, static strategies, neglecting problem-specific insights, premature optimization for speed.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond generic strategies. Design heuristics that intelligently adapt, incorporating problem understanding for robust, effective solutions.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
