Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, adaptive strategies, nuanced weighting, controlled exploration.
*   **Advice:** Go beyond feasibility checks. Design heuristics that dynamically adjust strategies based on bin states (e.g., fragmentation, fill level). Prioritize adaptive weighting schemes for different factors. Introduce randomness via controlled mechanisms (e.g., simulated annealing).
*   **Avoid:** Static weights, myopic decisions, numerical instability.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should not be rigid. Adaptability improves robustness and exploration avoids getting trapped in local optima. Numerical stability ensures the heuristic functions reliably.
