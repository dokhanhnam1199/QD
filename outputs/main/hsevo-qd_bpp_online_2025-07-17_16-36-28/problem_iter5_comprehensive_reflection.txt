Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to create a more potent guide for designing heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, robust exploration, problem-specific knowledge, computational efficiency.

*   **Advice:** Focus on *learning* from iterations. Adapt heuristic strategies based on problem instance characteristics and performance feedback. Rigorously test and validate.

*   **Avoid:** Blind parameter tuning, static strategies, neglecting problem-specific insights, premature optimization for speed.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond generic strategies. Design heuristics that intelligently adapt, incorporating problem understanding for robust, effective solutions.
