**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (19th), we see the first one considers multiple factors like wasted space, closeness to half-full, and spreading items, while the 19th uses only the ratio of item size to remaining capacity and its logarithm. The first one also handles the case where no bins can fit the item, while the 19th does not.

Comparing (2nd) vs (20th), we see the same as above.

Comparing (7th) vs (14th), we see that 7th prioritizes bins based on fit ratio and disincentivizes largely empty bins, setting a low priority for bins where the item doesn't fit by assigning -np.inf. 14th prioritizes bins where items fit and then prioritizes the bins with least wasted space.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), the main difference is 15th has the function to prioritize but it is never used to prioritize the bins.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (6th), they are exactly the same. The ranking between them is not based on their code.

Comparing (9th) vs (11th), (13th) vs (14th), they are exactly the same.

Comparing (10th) vs (12th), (7th) vs (8th), they are exactly the same.

Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors, including whether the item fits, wasted space, target fill level (e.g., half-full), and spreading items across bins. They also handle edge cases, such as when no bins can fit the item or when division by zero might occur. The best heuristics use a combination of rules and tunable parameters to adapt to specific problem instances. A crucial aspect is assigning priorities effectively based on these factors and using appropriate scaling or normalization. Randomness is also important for breaking ties.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and edge cases. Combine different strategies and allow for parameter tuning. Add a degree of randomness to improve exploration, and ensure the algorithm is numerically stable by using `epsilon` values.
