{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider multiple factors beyond just whether an item fits. Incorporating wasted space minimization, target fill levels, item spreading, and a small degree of randomness can significantly improve performance. Avoid overly simplistic calculations that don't capture the nuances of the problem.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and edge cases. Use vectorized operations for performance. Balance utilization and fragmentation. Experiment with different combinations of factors and carefully tune their weights. Always think about how to improve bin packing by spreading items across bins.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors and edge cases. Combine different strategies and allow for parameter tuning. Add a degree of randomness to improve exploration, and ensure the algorithm is numerically stable by using `epsilon` values.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
