Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.\n\n- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\n- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```."}
