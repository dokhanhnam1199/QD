Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines best aspects of v0 and v1 to create effective heuristic.\"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap - item >= 0\n\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return priorities\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 # Fits check\n    wasted_space = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item\n    priorities[valid_bins] += 1.0 / (1e-6 + wasted_space) # Minimize wasted space\n\n    mean_cap = np.mean(bins_remain_cap)\n    half_full_diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item - mean_cap/2)\n    priorities[valid_bins] += 1.0 / (1e-6 + half_full_diff) # Target Half-full\n\n    scaled_bins = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]**2\n    priorities[valid_bins] += scaled_bins / (np.sum(scaled_bins) + 1e-6) # Spread items\n\n    priorities[valid_bins] += np.random.rand(np.sum(valid_bins)) * 0.01 # Break ties\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted evaluation, adaptive strategies, nuanced weighting, controlled exploration.\n*   **Advice:** Go beyond feasibility checks. Design heuristics that dynamically adjust strategies based on bin states (e.g., fragmentation, fill level). Prioritize adaptive weighting schemes for different factors. Introduce randomness via controlled mechanisms (e.g., simulated annealing).\n*   **Avoid:** Static weights, myopic decisions, numerical instability.\n*   **Explanation:** Heuristics should not be rigid. Adaptability improves robustness and exploration avoids getting trapped in local optima. Numerical stability ensures the heuristic functions reliably.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
