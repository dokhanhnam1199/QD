**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach, considering fitting, wasted space, target fill level, and spreading items. It also includes a small random factor. The worst heuristic simply uses the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th) & (3rd) vs (18th), the trend is the same with the top heuristics using wasted space, a half full target and attempt to spread items, and the bottom heuristics using a basic log ratio calculation.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), these functions are identical.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these functions are identical.

Comparing (5th) vs (6th), these functions are identical.

Comparing (7th) vs (10th), these functions are identical.

Comparing (11th) vs (17th), these functions only have comments and an if statement.

Comparing (18th) vs (20th), these functions are identical.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst heuristics from 11th to 17th are incomplete implementations only containing comments and the starting `if` statement. This is much worse than the final 3 which utilize basic ratios.

Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors, like fitting, minimizing wasted space, aiming for half-full bins, and spreading items across bins. The use of a small random factor also seems beneficial. Worse heuristics rely on overly simple metrics like the log ratio of item size to bin capacity or are incomplete implementations.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider multiple factors beyond just whether an item fits. Incorporating wasted space minimization, target fill levels, item spreading, and a small degree of randomness can significantly improve performance. Avoid overly simplistic calculations that don't capture the nuances of the problem.
