Here's a redefined approach to "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Problem context, dynamic weighting, adaptive exploration, performance measurement.

*   **Advice:** Focus on designing heuristics that dynamically adapt to the specific problem instance and phase. Prioritize measurable performance improvements over theoretical elegance.

*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, reliance on static parameters, ignoring the problem's nuances and edge cases.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection analyzes *why* a heuristic works or fails in specific scenarios, guiding iterative refinement informed by empirical data. Don't just consider factors; understand their *impact* and interaction.
