Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design.

*   **Keywords:** Heuristic Improvement, Adaptive Strategy, Performance Profiling, Solution Diversity.
*   **Advice:** Systematically explore the solution space by generating diverse candidate heuristics. Profile performance to identify bottlenecks. Design adaptive mechanisms to adjust heuristic parameters based on problem instance characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition without empirical validation, neglecting solution diversity.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond generic advice. Focus on structured exploration, data-driven analysis, and flexible adaptation for robust and efficient heuristics.
