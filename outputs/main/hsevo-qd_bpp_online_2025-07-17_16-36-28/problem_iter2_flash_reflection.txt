**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic utilizes numpy for vectorized operations to calculate priorities, while the worst directly calculates the ratio of item size to remaining capacity and takes the negative logarithm. (2nd) vs (19th) shows a similar pattern: the better heuristic calculates a fit ratio and penalizes based on wasted space, including handling cases where the item doesn't fit using `-np.inf`, whereas the worse only calculates the priority based on the ratio of item size to bin capacity and doesn't add a penalty.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the 1st attempts to spread items and consider wasted space, while the 2nd focuses on fitting the items more closely. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these are the same code, indicating no difference in performance.
Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), the 19th is a duplicated code from 17th/18th, which calculates utilization ratios, penalizes almost-full bins, and boosts bins that can fit the item more than minimally. The 20th calculates priorities simply as the negative log of the item/bin capacity ratio. This implies more complex considerations in priority calculation work better.

Overall: The better heuristics calculate priorities based on multiple factors, including wasted space, utilization ratios, and penalties for almost-full bins and spreading items accross bins to avoid fragmentation. Vectorized operations using NumPy are more efficient. Handling edge cases such as items that don't fit is also crucial. More complex consideration in priority calculation is better.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and edge cases. Use vectorized operations for performance. Balance utilization and fragmentation. Experiment with different combinations of factors and carefully tune their weights. Always think about how to improve bin packing by spreading items across bins.
