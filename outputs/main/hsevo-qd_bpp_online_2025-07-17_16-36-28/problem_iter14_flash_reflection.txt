**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic incorporates fit, waste, fill level, and spread, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. The best also utilizes adaptive exploration with randomness, while the worst relies solely on logarithmic ratios.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the same code is repeated, indicating that these heuristics are of equal (presumably poor) quality. They are also identical to (1st), showing an error in the ranking.

Comparing (1st) vs (4th), both consider fit, waste, half-full target, and spread. However, (1st) has adaptive exploration that increases randomness for nearly full bins, using `np.where`, while (4th) uses a fixed small random component.

Comparing (4th) vs (11th), (4th) targets a half-full state and scales bin remaining capacity, whereas (11th) only considers fit, waste, and a basic spread mechanism.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), (9th) uses a fit ratio and energy landscape concept, potentially leading to instability with `-np.inf`. (10th) employs adaptive weighting for wasted space, dynamic adjustment for target fill, a bin fragmentation penalty, and controlled exploration (simulated annealing).

Comparing (17th) vs (18th), both introduce a large number of tunable parameters, but (18th) also includes weights for each component and a scaling exponent for the half-full target. However, neither includes any actual computations, so their relative ranking is moot.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors (fit, waste, fill level, spread), use adaptive exploration strategies, and dynamically adjust weights. The worse heuristics tend to oversimplify the problem, lack adaptability, or introduce instability. Sophistication alone doesn't guarantee success. Simply adding tunable parameters without implementing the core logic doesn't improve performance.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics combine multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights and controlled exploration. Avoid oversimplification, instability, and excessive parameterization without implementation. Favor dynamic adjustments based on problem state over static weights.
