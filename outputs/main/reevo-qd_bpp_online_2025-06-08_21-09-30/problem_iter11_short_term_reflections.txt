The better code uses dynamic weight adjustment and encourages balanced bin utilization, improving performance.

Prioritize sweet spots, penalize fragmentation, and dynamically adjust weights based on bin capacity distribution.

Reduced best-fit/first-fit influence, sweet spot tuning, dynamic weight adjustments, and balance utilization are key improvements.

Feasibility check, residual capacity, sweet spot, and index-based tie-breaking improve bin packing.

Prioritize sweet spot, heavily penalize fragmentation/almost-full bins, and reduce reliance on best/first fit.

Focus on sweet spot, fragmentation, balancing, and dynamic weight adjustments, reducing reliance on best/first fit.

Focus on sweet spot, fragmentation, balance, and dynamically adjust penalties based on bin stats.

Focus on weaker best-fit influence, adjusted sweet spot, and dynamic weight adaptation based on bin diversity.

Prioritize sweet spot, fragmentation, and balance. Dynamically adjust weights based on bin capacity distribution.

Penalizing almost-full bins improves packing. Explore dynamic sweet spot adjustment and adaptive tie-breaking mechanisms.
