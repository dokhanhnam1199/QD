Prioritize sweet spot and fragmentation control. Adjust weights and thresholds for better performance.

Reduced best-fit/first-fit influence, tuned sweet-spot/fragmentation thresholds, added dynamic weight adjustment based on bin variance.

Prioritize sweet spots and fragmentation penalties. Reduce best-fit, first-fit bonuses, and nearly full bin heuristic.

Fine-tune sweet spot, fragmentation, and almost-full penalties. Reduce best-fit and first-fit weights for better performance.

The better code incorporates feasibility, fragmentation avoidance, sweet spot targeting, and tie-breaking for improved bin packing.

Feasibility, fragmentation avoidance, sweet spot target, and tie-breaking with index awareness are key improvements.

Fine-tune weights, add fragmentation/almost-full penalties, and dynamically adjust based on bin capacity distribution.

Prioritize sweet spots, penalize fragmentation/near-full bins, and dynamically adjust weights based on bin capacity distribution.

Prioritize sweet spots, penalize fragmentation/near-full bins, and dynamically adjust weights based on bin capacity distribution.

Reduced best-fit/first-fit influence and dynamic weight adjustments based on capacity distribution improved performance.
