Feasibility check, residual capacity, sweet spot, and tie-breaking improve bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize sweet spots, penalize fragmentation and near-full bins, and carefully tune weights based on thresholds.

Feasibility check, remaining capacity, sweet spot, and tie-breaking improve performance by balancing bin utilization.

Prioritize feasibility, sweet spots, and tie-breaking. Avoid fragmentation and penalize almost-full bins.

Penalizing almost-full bins improves packing. Explore adaptive sweet spot ranges and dynamic penalty adjustments.

Adding a penalty for almost full bins improves performance. Consider further penalizing near-full bins to reduce fragmentation.

The better code penalizes almost-full bins, reducing fragmentation, a crucial aspect often missed.

Penalizing almost-full bins improves performance. Consider adaptive thresholding or learning bin capacity distribution.

Fine-tune weights, sweet spot range, and penalties for fragmentation and almost-full bins. Reduce Best Fit influence.

Incorporate feasibility checks, fragmentation avoidance, sweet-spot bin filling, and tie-breaking strategies.
