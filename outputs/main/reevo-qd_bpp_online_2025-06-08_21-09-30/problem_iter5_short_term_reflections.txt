Penalizing almost-full bins improves performance. Explore adaptive sweet spot ranges and dynamic penalty adjustments.

The better code combines feasibility, best-fit, fragmentation avoidance, sweet spot, and tie-breaking for improved performance.

The better code refines tie-breaking, explicitly penalizes fragmentation, and modulates penalty strengths for improved bin packing.

The better code adds fragmentation and almost-full bin penalties, and adjusts tie-breaking/bonus weights.

Feasibility, remaining capacity, sweet spot, and tie-breaking enhance bin selection for online BPP.

Penalizing almost-full bins improves performance. Consider adaptive sweet-spot ranges and refined tie-breaking for further gains.

Feasibility filtering, fragmentation avoidance, sweet spot targeting, and tie-breaking boost performance.

Feasibility, fragmentation avoidance, sweet spot targeting, and tie-breaking enhance online bin packing heuristics.

Adding a penalty for almost-full bins improved performance. Consider penalizing other undesirable bin states.

Emphasize fragmentation and almost-full bin penalties. Refine sweet spot and tie-breaking bonuses with careful scaling.
