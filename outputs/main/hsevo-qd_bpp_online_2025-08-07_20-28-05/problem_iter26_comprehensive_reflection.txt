- **Keywords:** Inverse‑slack, ε‑greedy, lightweight UCB, feasibility flag, softmax normalization, minimal per‑bin state.  
- **Advice:** Start with deterministic inverse‑slack + ε‑greedy, add lightweight UCB only when enough data, keep per‑bin stats minimal, update only after successful placements, and expose a single scoring function.  
- **Avoid:** Over‑engineering mix of metrics, heavy state, duplicate code, excessive randomness, hidden logic, extra hyper‑parameters, waste‑promoting reward structures.  
- **Explanation:** This keeps exploration‑exploitation balance, low runtime, reproducible outcomes, and a maintainable, extensible codebase.
