```python
import numpy as np
def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    eps = 1e-12
    diff = bins_remain_cap - item
    mask = diff >= 0
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    priorities[mask] = 1.0/(diff[mask] + eps)
    return priorities
