Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    epsilon = 0.2\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    scores = np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    leftovers = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    scores[feasible] = 1.0 / (leftovers + 1.0)\n    scores = (1 - epsilon) * scores + epsilon * np.random.rand(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])\n    return scores\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** simplicity, modularity, deterministic, explainability, balanced scoring.  \n- **Advice:** Build a single, stateless scoring function that linearly combines normalized slack and empirical reward, separate feature extraction, and enforce explicit infeasibility handling.  \n- **Avoid:** Random \u03b5\u2011greedy tweaks, softmax probability layers, hidden state, duplicated code, and excess hyper\u2011parameters.  \n- **Explanation:** A deterministic, modular pipeline yields transparent heuristics that are easy to maintain, debug, and compose while still capturing key trade\u2011offs.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
