**Analysis:**  
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that Heuristics 1️⃣ (global _selection_counts/_total_rewards, ε‑greedy inverse‑slack, reward weighting) adapts via per‑bin learning, while Heuristics 20️⃣ only applies inverse slack with softmax and ε‑noise, lacking any feedback loop.  
(second best) vs (second worst), Heuristics 2️⃣ (simple avg‑reward update, deterministic‑plus‑random score) beats Heuristics 19️⃣ (class with UCB, diversity term, temperature decay, many hyper‑parameters) – the leaner reward estimator is more stable than a heavily tuned UCB scheme.  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the code is virtually identical (same global state, same scoring); the ranking difference likely stems from marginal documentation or initialization nuances rather than algorithmic change.  
(3rd) vs (4th), Heuristics 3️⃣ returns softmax probabilities from inverse‑slack + ε‑noise, whereas Heuristics 4️⃣ adds per‑bin avg‑reward and a UCB bonus. The extra UCB term can cause over‑exploration and noisy updates, making the simpler softmax version superior.  
(second worst) vs (worst), Heuristics 19️⃣ (UCB, diversity, temperature decay, learning updates) outperforms Heuristics 20️⃣ (static inverse‑slack softmax) by retaining a modest adaptive component.  
Overall: lightweight adaptive heuristics that blend deterministic fit with modest ε‑exploration and a single reward statistic consistently beat overly complex designs with multiple bonuses, aggressive UCB terms, or excessive randomness.

**Experience:**  
Favor simple stateful scoring (inverse slack + ε‑greedy + average reward). Keep hyper‑parameters minimal; avoid heavyweight UCB/diversity unless finely tuned. Use softmax for probability‑like outputs and ensure clear documentation for maintainability.
