Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    epsilon = 0.2\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    scores = np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    leftovers = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    scores[feasible] = 1.0 / (leftovers + 1.0)\n    scores = (1 - epsilon) * scores + epsilon * np.random.rand(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])\n    return scores\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n_selection_counts = None\n_total_rewards = None\n_total_calls = 0\n\n    global _selection_counts, _total_rewards, _total_calls\n    bins_remain_cap = np.asarray(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    n = bins_remain_cap.shape[0]\n    if n == 0:\n        return np.array([], dtype=float)\n    if _selection_counts is None or _selection_counts.shape[0] != n:\n        _selection_counts = np.zeros(n, dtype=float)\n        _total_rewards = np.zeros(n, dtype=float)\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return np.full(n, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    scores = np.full(n, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    leftovers = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    deterministic = 1.0 / (leftovers + 1.0)\n    epsilon = 0.2\n    random_part = np.random.rand(feasible.sum())\n    base_score = (1 - epsilon) * deterministic + epsilon * random_part\n    avg_reward_feas = np.zeros_like(base_score)\n    mask_counts_feas = _selection_counts[feasible] > 0\n    avg_reward_feas[mask_counts_feas] = _total_rewards[feasible][mask_counts_feas] / _selection_counts[feasible][mask_counts_feas]\n    reward_weight = 0.3\n    combined_feas = base_score + reward_weight * avg_reward_feas\n    scores[feasible] = combined_feas\n    best = np.argmax(scores)\n    _total_calls += 1\n    leftover = bins_remain_cap[best] - item\n    reward = -leftover\n    _selection_counts[best] += 1\n    _total_rewards[best] += reward\n    return scores\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- - **(Best) vs (Worst):** Heuristic\u202f1st is a concise \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scorer with explicit infeasibility handling (\u2011inf). Heuristic\u202f20th wraps a full class using UCB, median\u2011based diversity, temperature decay, and extensive state. While more adaptive, it introduces substantial overhead and complexity, risking stale statistics and harder debugging.  \n- **(Second best) vs (Second worst):** Heuristic\u202f2nd duplicates the 1st implementation\u2014still robust despite lacking a docstring. Heuristic\u202f19th is a stub that returns a zero array for feasible bins, providing no meaningful priority.  \n- **(1st) vs (2nd):** The source code is identical; the ranking likely reflects external factors (e.g., runtime, hidden bug fixes) not evident here.  \n- **(3rd) vs (4th):** Both add global counters, reward tracking, and a 0.3\u2011weighted average\u2011reward term to the base score, enabling lightweight online learning. Their duplication suggests ranking differences stem from subtle initialization or performance nuances.  \n- **(Second worst) vs (Worst):** Heuristic\u202f19th (stub) offers no discrimination between bins, while Heuristic\u202f20th (complex adaptive) at least attempts to learn; the stub is thus worse.  \n- **Overall:** Top heuristics prioritize simplicity, clear \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scoring, and minimal state. Mid\u2011ranked methods enrich this with linear/squared slack penalties, softmax scaling, or modest reward tracking, achieving a better balance of fit and exploration. The lowest ranks either provide no guidance (stubs) or incur excessive overhead without clear benefit.\n- \n- Keywords: size class grouping, descending order, first\u2011fit, single\u2011pass swap, rule\u2011based.  \n- Advice: Split items into large, medium, small buckets; pack each bucket by first\u2011fit in descending size; then run one pass swapping a small item from an emptier bin with a larger item from a fuller bin if it reduces the max empty space.  \n- Avoid: Random exploration, multi\u2011metric scoring, online learning, extra hyper\u2011parameters, placeholder or duplicated code, and any heavy state tracking.  \n- Explanation: This simple, rule\u2011based approach uses only item size, runs in linear time, and improves bin utilization without complex scores or hidden randomness.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
