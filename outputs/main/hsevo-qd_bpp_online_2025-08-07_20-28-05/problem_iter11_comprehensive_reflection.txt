- **Keywords:** simplicity, modularity, deterministic, explainability, balanced scoring.  
- **Advice:** Build a single, stateless scoring function that linearly combines normalized slack and empirical reward, separate feature extraction, and enforce explicit infeasibility handling.  
- **Avoid:** Random ε‑greedy tweaks, softmax probability layers, hidden state, duplicated code, and excess hyper‑parameters.  
- **Explanation:** A deterministic, modular pipeline yields transparent heuristics that are easy to maintain, debug, and compose while still capturing key trade‑offs.
