- Keywords: size class grouping, descending order, first‑fit, single‑pass swap, rule‑based.  
- Advice: Split items into large, medium, small buckets; pack each bucket by first‑fit in descending size; then run one pass swapping a small item from an emptier bin with a larger item from a fuller bin if it reduces the max empty space.  
- Avoid: Random exploration, multi‑metric scoring, online learning, extra hyper‑parameters, placeholder or duplicated code, and any heavy state tracking.  
- Explanation: This simple, rule‑based approach uses only item size, runs in linear time, and improves bin utilization without complex scores or hidden randomness.
