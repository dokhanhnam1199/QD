**Analysis:**  
- **1st vs 20th:** The best heuristic uses an ε‑greedy inverse‑slack score (`1/(leftover+1)`) with a random term and returns raw scores, encouraging tight fits and exploration. The worst heuristic (worst‑fit) returns squared leftover (`(slack)²`) with no randomness, promoting wasteful packing.  
- **2nd vs 19th:** Identical to the 1st/20th comparison; second‑best also uses ε‑greedy inverse‑slack, while second‑worst repeats the pure worst‑fit rule.  
- **3rd vs 18th:** The 3rd heuristic adds a feasibility check, combines deterministic and random parts, then applies a softmax to produce a probability distribution, improving robustness. The 18th remains deterministic worst‑fit with no exploration.  
- **4th vs 17th:** 4th is essentially the same softmax‑based ε‑greedy approach as 3rd, while 17th is a plain ε‑greedy inverse‑slack without softmax, offering less calibrated stochastic selection.  
- **5th vs 16th:** Mirrors 4th vs 17th; 5th retains the softmax probability conversion, 16th repeats the simple ε‑greedy raw score.  
- **6th vs 15th:** Same pattern; 6th uses softmax probabilities, 15th provides raw ε‑greedy scores.  
- **7th vs 14th:** 7th introduces configurable `offset` and `score_scale` with a docstring, allowing tuning of the deterministic term while still using ε‑greedy randomness. 14th (a duplicate of 11th) uses a weighted mix of inverse and linear slack plus softmax, but lacks the extra tunable parameters.  
- **8th vs 13th:** 8th blends inverse slack with a negative squared‑slack penalty (`-β·slack²`) and ε‑greedy randomness, improving discrimination between very tight and moderately tight fits. 13th simply returns `-slack+ε`, a deterministic tight‑fit score without exploration.  
- **9th vs 12th:** Both compute softmax of `exp(-slack/temperature)`, yielding a probabilistic preference for tighter bins; they include docstrings clarifying purpose.  
- **10th vs 11th:** 10th returns `-slack+ε` (deterministic tight‑fit). 11th augments this with a weighted sum of inverse and linear slack, ε‑greedy randomness, and softmax, providing richer scoring.  
- **Comparisons among adjacent ranks:** 1st vs 2nd are identical (no difference). 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th are repeats of the same softmax‑based ε‑greedy design, showing no degradation. 15th‑17th repeat the simple ε‑greedy raw score, indicating a step down from the probability‑scaled versions. 18th‑20th are identical worst‑fit implementations, confirming the lowest rank.

**Experience:**  
Prefer ε‑greedy inverse‑slack scores with feasibility checks, add controlled randomness, and optionally convert to softmax probabilities. Avoid pure worst‑fit rules; use tunable offsets/scales and combine linear and inverse slack for richer, more robust heuristics.
