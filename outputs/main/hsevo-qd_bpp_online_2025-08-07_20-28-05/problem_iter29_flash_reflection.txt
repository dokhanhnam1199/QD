**Analysis:**  
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best (Heuristic 1) is a compact, vectorized implementation that cleanly separates the inverse‑slack deterministic term and the ε‑greedy random term, with no hidden state or side‑effects; the worst (Heuristic 20) mixes many ad‑hoc bonuses (median diversity, UCB, diversity weight), contains inconsistent naming (`_pv2_counts` vs `bins_remain_cap`), and uses a clunky `best_idx` fallback, making it hard to read, maintain, and debug.  

(second best) vs (second worst), we see that Heuristic 2 includes a clear docstring, explicit handling of empty inputs, consistent shape checks, and a modest learning component (average reward); Heuristic 19 is essentially a stub with no docstring, no scoring beyond −∞, and no useful logic, offering no guidance to a caller.  

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that Heuristic 1 favors simplicity and deterministic behavior, while Heuristic 2 adds stateful online learning (selection counts, total rewards) and a reward‑weight term. The added complexity can improve adaptivity but also introduces mutable globals and extra bookkeeping, which may affect reproducibility.  

(3rd) vs (4th), we see that Heuristic 3 returns a proper probability distribution via softmax, enabling stochastic selection, but lacks a docstring; Heuristic 4 provides a full docstring with parameter explanations and allows configurable offset and scaling, yet still returns raw scores rather than probabilities, limiting its direct use for sampling.  

(second worst) vs (worst), we see that Heuristic 19 offers only a minimal placeholder with no scoring logic, while Heuristic 20 attempts a richer model (median‑based diversity, UCB, epsilon random) but suffers from duplicated code, unclear variable intent, and a fragile best‑index default, making it less reliable than the trivial stub.  

Overall, the top heuristics prioritize clear vectorized math, minimal side‑effects, and concise documentation; lower‑ranked versions either add unnecessary complexity, lack proper comments/docstrings, or contain bugs that outweigh any theoretical benefit.

**Experience:**  
Keep heuristics simple, well‑documented, and vectorized; use explicit docstrings, avoid mutable globals unless needed, and prefer stable deterministic scores with modest ε‑exploration over tangled ad‑hoc bonuses. This yields maintainable, robust, and performant designs.
