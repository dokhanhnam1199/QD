### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Design heuristics that score bins by minimizing slack (e.g., inverse or negative leftover), blend deterministic scores with a modest ε‑greedy random term for robustness, and avoid reward structures that promote waste. Proper handling of infeasibility (‑∞) and optional softmax normalization can further improve stability.
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    epsilon = 0.2
    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores = np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    leftovers = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item
    scores[feasible] = 1.0 / (leftovers + 1.0)
    scores = (1 - epsilon) * scores + epsilon * np.random.rand(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])
    return scores

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Priority for Worst-Fit: higher value for bins leaving most empty after packing."""
    return np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, (bins_remain_cap - item) ** 2, -np.inf)

### Analyze & experience
- - **Comparing (best) vs (worst):** The best heuristic (1st) uses an ε‑greedy scheme with ε = 0.2 and a deterministic score `1/(leftover+1)`, favoring bins that leave little slack while still allowing randomness for tie‑breaking. The worst heuristic (20th) adopts a worst‑fit rule ` (leftover)² `, explicitly rewarding large slack and thus driving waste.  
- **(Second best) vs (second worst):** Heuristic 2nd is a duplicate of the best, retaining the same inverse‑leftover scoring. Heuristic 19th mirrors the worst‑fit rule of the 20th, again encouraging maximal leftover. The contrast is identical to the best–worst pair, reinforcing that inverse‑slack scoring beats squared‑slack scoring.  
- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Although the source code is identical, the ranking implies subtle implementation differences (e.g., randomness seed, integration context) that affect empirical performance; the core design—ε‑greedy with inverse slack—remains the decisive factor.  
- **(3rd) vs (4th):** Both are exact copies of the best heuristic, so any performance gap must stem from external factors (data ordering, random state) rather than code. This highlights the sensitivity of stochastic heuristics to randomness.  
- **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst):** Heuristics 19th and 20th are byte‑for‑byte duplicates of the worst‑fit rule, confirming that identical worst‑fit logic consistently yields the lowest ranking.  
- **Overall:** The ranking aligns with how closely each heuristic’s deterministic component mirrors the bin‑packing objective (minimizing leftover). Inverse‑slack or negative‑slack scores combined with moderate ε‑greedy randomness outperform raw worst‑fit or overly aggressive exploration.
- 
- **Keywords:** slack minimization, ε‑greedy, softmax scaling, infeasibility penalty, diversity.  
- **Advice:** Score each bin by a normalized negative slack, add a small ε random perturbation, and apply a softmax to convert scores to selection probabilities.  
- **Avoid:** Fixed deterministic ordering, overly large ε that drowns the signal, reward functions that reward waste or ignore infeasibility.  
- **Explanation:** This mix preserves exploitation of tight fits while retaining exploration, stabilizes learning via bounded probabilities, and quickly rejects impossible placements.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    epsilon = 0.2
    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores = np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    leftovers = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item
    scores[feasible] = 1.0 / (leftovers + 1.0)
    scores = (1 - epsilon) * scores + epsilon * np.random.rand(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])
    return scores

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
- **Keywords:** slack minimization, ε‑greedy, softmax scaling, infeasibility penalty, diversity.  
- **Advice:** Score each bin by a normalized negative slack, add a small ε random perturbation, and apply a softmax to convert scores to selection probabilities.  
- **Avoid:** Fixed deterministic ordering, overly large ε that drowns the signal, reward functions that reward waste or ignore infeasibility.  
- **Explanation:** This mix preserves exploitation of tight fits while retaining exploration, stabilizes learning via bounded probabilities, and quickly rejects impossible placements.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

You are an expert in code review. Your task extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters.

[code]
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    epsilon = 0.2
    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores = np.full(bins_remain_cap.shape, -np.inf, dtype=float)
    leftovers = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item
    scores[feasible] = 1.0 / (leftovers + 1.0)
    scores = (1 - epsilon) * scores + epsilon * np.random.rand(bins_remain_cap.shape[0])
    return scores

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
