**Analysis:**  
- **Comparing (best) vs (worst):** The best heuristic (1st) uses an ε‑greedy scheme with ε = 0.2 and a deterministic score `1/(leftover+1)`, favoring bins that leave little slack while still allowing randomness for tie‑breaking. The worst heuristic (20th) adopts a worst‑fit rule ` (leftover)² `, explicitly rewarding large slack and thus driving waste.  
- **(Second best) vs (second worst):** Heuristic 2nd is a duplicate of the best, retaining the same inverse‑leftover scoring. Heuristic 19th mirrors the worst‑fit rule of the 20th, again encouraging maximal leftover. The contrast is identical to the best–worst pair, reinforcing that inverse‑slack scoring beats squared‑slack scoring.  
- **Comparing (1st) vs (2nd):** Although the source code is identical, the ranking implies subtle implementation differences (e.g., randomness seed, integration context) that affect empirical performance; the core design—ε‑greedy with inverse slack—remains the decisive factor.  
- **(3rd) vs (4th):** Both are exact copies of the best heuristic, so any performance gap must stem from external factors (data ordering, random state) rather than code. This highlights the sensitivity of stochastic heuristics to randomness.  
- **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst):** Heuristics 19th and 20th are byte‑for‑byte duplicates of the worst‑fit rule, confirming that identical worst‑fit logic consistently yields the lowest ranking.  
- **Overall:** The ranking aligns with how closely each heuristic’s deterministic component mirrors the bin‑packing objective (minimizing leftover). Inverse‑slack or negative‑slack scores combined with moderate ε‑greedy randomness outperform raw worst‑fit or overly aggressive exploration.

**Experience:**  
Design heuristics that score bins by minimizing slack (e.g., inverse or negative leftover), blend deterministic scores with a modest ε‑greedy random term for robustness, and avoid reward structures that promote waste. Proper handling of infeasibility (‑∞) and optional softmax normalization can further improve stability.
