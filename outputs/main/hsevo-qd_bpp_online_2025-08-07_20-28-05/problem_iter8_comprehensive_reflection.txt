- **Keywords:** adaptive, modular, constraint‑driven, exploration‑exploitation  
- **Advice:** Build a deterministic core that exploits structural properties (e.g., priority queues, incremental updates) and pair it with a lightweight meta‑selector that chooses among several simple rules based on recent success, updating its preferences online.  
- **Avoid:** Fixed numeric thresholds, static random mixing, and manual parameter tweaks.  
- **Explanation:** The deterministic core ensures fast feasible decisions, while the online meta‑selector adds diverse behavior without heavy hyper‑parameters, yielding robust performance across varied problem instances.
