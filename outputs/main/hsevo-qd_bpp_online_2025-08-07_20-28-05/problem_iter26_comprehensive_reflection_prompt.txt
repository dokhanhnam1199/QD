{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nMaintain minimal per\u2011bin statistics (counts, avg reward), use inverse slack for tight\u2011fit bias, add a small \u03b5\u2011greedy term, and optionally a lightweight UCB bonus. Keep updates simple and only after feasible selections; avoid unnecessary complexity or duplicated code.\nStart with a simple inverse\u2011slack\u202f+\u202f\u03b5\u2011greedy score as a strong baseline. Add learning (reward averaging, UCB) only when you have sufficient interaction data and can tune exploration weights; otherwise keep the model stateless to preserve robustness and speed.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics that score bins by minimizing slack (e.g., inverse or negative leftover), blend deterministic scores with a modest \u03b5\u2011greedy random term for robustness, and avoid reward structures that promote waste. Proper handling of infeasibility (\u2011\u221e) and optional softmax normalization can further improve stability.\n\nPrefer \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scores with feasibility checks, add controlled randomness, and optionally convert to softmax probabilities. Avoid pure worst\u2011fit rules; use tunable offsets/scales and combine linear and inverse slack for richer, more robust heuristics.\n\nKeep heuristics simple: use a deterministic core (e.g., inverse slack), add modest \u03b5\u2011greedy noise, handle infeasibility cleanly, and only apply softmax when probabilities are needed. Avoid unnecessary hyper\u2011parameters, heavy state, and unused imports.\n\nPrioritize simple, explainable scoring that balances slack and empirical reward. Avoid overcomplicated mixtures of metrics, excessive randomness, or internal state that forces hidden selection logic. Duplicated code indicates a maintenance smell. Use clear function boundaries and deterministic outputs for easier composability.\n\nSimple, well\u2011documented \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scoring works best; modest linear/squared slack penalties and softmax\u202fscaling improve balance. Add lightweight online learning (e.g., UCB) only when state overhead is justified. Avoid over\u2011engineered or placeholder heuristics that lack actionable scores.\n\nCombine inverse\u2011slack with reward\u2011based updates, add \u03b5\u2011greedy/UCB exploration, and keep state minimal. Use softmax only for probability output; prioritize adaptive learning for robust online bin\u2011packing heuristics.\n\nFavor simple stateful scoring (inverse slack\u202f+\u202f\u03b5\u2011greedy\u202f+\u202faverage reward). Keep hyper\u2011parameters minimal; avoid heavyweight UCB/diversity unless finely tuned. Use softmax for probability\u2011like outputs and ensure clear documentation for maintainability.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
