**Analysis:**  
- **(Best) vs (Worst):** Heuristic 1st is a concise ε‑greedy inverse‑slack scorer with explicit infeasibility handling (‑inf). Heuristic 20th wraps a full class using UCB, median‑based diversity, temperature decay, and extensive state. While more adaptive, it introduces substantial overhead and complexity, risking stale statistics and harder debugging.  
- **(Second best) vs (Second worst):** Heuristic 2nd duplicates the 1st implementation—still robust despite lacking a docstring. Heuristic 19th is a stub that returns a zero array for feasible bins, providing no meaningful priority.  
- **(1st) vs (2nd):** The source code is identical; the ranking likely reflects external factors (e.g., runtime, hidden bug fixes) not evident here.  
- **(3rd) vs (4th):** Both add global counters, reward tracking, and a 0.3‑weighted average‑reward term to the base score, enabling lightweight online learning. Their duplication suggests ranking differences stem from subtle initialization or performance nuances.  
- **(Second worst) vs (Worst):** Heuristic 19th (stub) offers no discrimination between bins, while Heuristic 20th (complex adaptive) at least attempts to learn; the stub is thus worse.  
- **Overall:** Top heuristics prioritize simplicity, clear ε‑greedy inverse‑slack scoring, and minimal state. Mid‑ranked methods enrich this with linear/squared slack penalties, softmax scaling, or modest reward tracking, achieving a better balance of fit and exploration. The lowest ranks either provide no guidance (stubs) or incur excessive overhead without clear benefit.  

**Experience:**  
Simple, well‑documented ε‑greedy inverse‑slack scoring works best; modest linear/squared slack penalties and softmax scaling improve balance. Add lightweight online learning (e.g., UCB) only when state overhead is justified. Avoid over‑engineered or placeholder heuristics that lack actionable scores.
