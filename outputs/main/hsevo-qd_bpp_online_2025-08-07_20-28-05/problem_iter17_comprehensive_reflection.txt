- **Keywords:** feasibility filter, surrogate cost model, normalized profit‑to‑resource ratio, offline calibration  
- **Advice:** Apply a two‑stage pipeline: prune infeasible options with deterministic rules, then rank the remainder by a single normalized efficiency metric derived from an offline‑trained surrogate; retrain the surrogate periodically without runtime state.  
- **Avoid:** Random exploration terms, online state accumulation, multi‑parameter softmax scaling, heavy hyper‑parameter tuning, duplicated code, ad‑hoc reward averaging.  
- **Explanation:** This yields a fast, transparent heuristic; feasibility is guaranteed, ranking is data‑grounded, and offline learning limits runtime overhead while preserving interpretability.
