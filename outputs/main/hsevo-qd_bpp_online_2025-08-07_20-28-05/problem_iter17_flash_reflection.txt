**Analysis:**  

- **(Best) Heuristic 1 vs (Worst) Heuristic 20** – Heuristic 1 is a *stateless* inverse‑slack score with a tiny ε‑random perturbation. It is O(n) with virtually no bookkeeping. Heuristic 20 augments the same core with **global counters**, **UCB‑style exploration**, a **median‑based diversity term**, and **reward updates** after every placement. This yields a far richer model but introduces heavy state, many hyper‑parameters (c, ε, weights), and non‑trivial update cost. In practice the extra complexity can cause high variance and over‑fitting on short streams, while the simple heuristic remains robust and fast.

- **(2nd Best) Heuristic 2 vs (2nd Worst) Heuristic 19** – Heuristic 2 is identical to the best one (pure inverse‑slack + ε‑noise). Heuristic 19 only defines a signature and docstring; the body stops after allocating a zero‑filled array and never computes a meaningful score. Consequently it cannot guide any placement, making it dramatically weaker.

- **1st vs 2nd** – Both are byte‑for‑byte copies; the ranking difference likely reflects stochastic performance variations rather than code differences.

- **3rd vs 4th** – Heuristic 3 mirrors the baseline (no state). Heuristic 4 adds **online averaging of rewards** per bin and a **reward weight** (0.3). This gives the algorithm a learning signal that can improve fit over long horizons, but it also requires correct initialization, handling of sparse updates, and careful tuning of the reward weight to avoid destabilising the deterministic slack term.

- **(Second Worst) Heuristic 19 vs (Worst) Heuristic 20** – Heuristic 19 is essentially a stub (returns zeros), while Heuristic 20 implements a full **UCB‑plus‑diversity** scheme. Despite being more sophisticated, Heuristic 20 still ranks lower than many intermediate designs because its added machinery can outweigh benefits on typical benchmark streams, especially when the exploration bonus dominates the core inverse‑slack signal.

- **Overall patterns** – The top‑ranked heuristics are *minimalistic*: a deterministic inverse‑slack component (or slack‑based linear penalty) combined with a modest ε‑random term. Mid‑ranked methods introduce **softmax probabilities**, **linear‑plus‑quadratic slack penalties**, or **multi‑rule weighted sums** (e.g., Heuristic 10), offering more flexibility but demanding extra parameters. The lowest‑ranked approaches either lack a functional core (Heuristic 18, 19) or overload the decision with many learned components (Heuristics 17, 20) that are hard to tune and may degrade performance without ample data.

**Experience:**  
Start with a simple inverse‑slack + ε‑greedy score as a strong baseline. Add learning (reward averaging, UCB) only when you have sufficient interaction data and can tune exploration weights; otherwise keep the model stateless to preserve robustness and speed.
