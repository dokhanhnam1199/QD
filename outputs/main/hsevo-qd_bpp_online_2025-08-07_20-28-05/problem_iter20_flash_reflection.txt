**Analysis:**  
Comparing **(best)** (#1) vs **(worst)** (#20), we see the best heuristic maintains global state (`_selection_counts`, `_total_rewards`) to learn per‑bin rewards, combines deterministic inverse‑slack with an ε‑greedy random term, and updates the reward after each placement. The worst heuristic merely computes inverse‑slack, applies a temperature‑scaled softmax, adds ε‑noise, and never learns or adapts.  

**(second best)** (#2) vs **(second worst)** (#19), both contain a docstring‑free reward learning core, but #2 lacks any exploration beyond ε‑greedy randomness. #19 enriches the base score with a UCB exploration bonus, a median‑based diversity term, and weighted blending, thereby balancing exploitation with more sophisticated exploration.  

Comparing **(1st)** (#1) vs **(2nd)** (#2), the code is virtually identical: both initialize global counters, compute the same deterministic + ε‑random base, add a small reward‑weight term (`reward_weight = 0.1`), and update the same global statistics after the chosen bin. No functional difference is evident.  

**(3rd)** (#3) vs **(4th)** (#4), #3 retains the reward learning machinery, raises `reward_weight` to 0.3, tracks `_total_calls`, and still returns raw scores. #4 abandons all learning, instead normalizing scores with a softmax (probability) transform and returning probabilities, making it a pure static scoring rule.  

Comparing **(second worst)** (#19) vs **(worst)** (#20), #19 blends deterministic inverse‑slack, ε‑randomness, UCB, and diversity, and updates per‑bin reward statistics. #20 reduces everything to an inverse‑slack softmax with ε‑noise, with no history, no UCB, and no diversity term.  

**Overall:** The top heuristics consistently (i) use inverse‑slack as a deterministic fit measure, (ii) augment it with learned per‑bin reward signals, (iii) control exploration via ε‑greedy, UCB, or diversity weighting, and (iv) keep state lightweight. Lower‑ranked versions strip away learning and exploration, relying on static transforms (softmax, random tie‑breakers) that cannot adapt to instance dynamics.  

**Experience:** Combine inverse‑slack with reward‑based updates, add ε‑greedy/UCB exploration, and keep state minimal. Use softmax only for probability output; prioritize adaptive learning for robust online bin‑packing heuristics.
