**Analysis:**  
Comparing **(best) vs (worst)**, we see that the best heuristic is a terse, stateless function that imports only *numpy*, computes a feasible mask, uses a simple inverse‑slack score, blends a modest ε‑greedy random term, and returns raw scores (‑inf for infeasible). The worst heuristic is a heavyweight class with many unused imports, stateful counters, UCB‑style confidence bounds, diversity terms, temperature decay, and reward updates—far more parameters and logic than needed, with no clear documentation of why each term helps.  

**(second best) vs (second worst)** shows a similar gap: the second‑best function adds an early‑exit for infeasibility and a numerically‑stable softmax conversion, still staying stateless and lightweight. The second‑worst (identical to the worst) repeats the complex UCB machinery, bringing the same overhead and opaque hyper‑parameters.  

**Comparing (1st) vs (2nd)**, both share the same deterministic core (inverse slack + ε‑greedy), but the 2nd adds a softmax layer and an explicit infeasibility guard. The 1st is marginally faster and returns scores directly; the 2nd is better suited for stochastic selection at the cost of extra exponentials.  

**(3rd) vs (4th)** are exact duplicates of the 2nd version—no code or comment differences, highlighting redundancy in the list.  

**Comparing (second worst) vs (worst)** reveals no distinction: both are identical stateful UCB implementations, offering no incremental benefit despite being labeled separately.  

**Overall:** Simplicity, a clear deterministic metric, and a tiny ε‑greedy term dominate performance. Over‑parameterization, deep statefulness, and excessive randomness consistently degrade heuristic quality.  

**Experience:**  
Keep heuristics simple: use a deterministic core (e.g., inverse slack), add modest ε‑greedy noise, handle infeasibility cleanly, and only apply softmax when probabilities are needed. Avoid unnecessary hyper‑parameters, heavy state, and unused imports.
