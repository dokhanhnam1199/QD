{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrefer \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scores with feasibility checks, add controlled randomness, and optionally convert to softmax probabilities. Avoid pure worst\u2011fit rules; use tunable offsets/scales and combine linear and inverse slack for richer, more robust heuristics.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nDesign heuristics that score bins by minimizing slack (e.g., inverse or negative leftover), blend deterministic scores with a modest \u03b5\u2011greedy random term for robustness, and avoid reward structures that promote waste. Proper handling of infeasibility (\u2011\u221e) and optional softmax normalization can further improve stability.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
