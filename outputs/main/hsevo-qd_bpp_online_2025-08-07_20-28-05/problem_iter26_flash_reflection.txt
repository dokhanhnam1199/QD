**Analysis:**  
- **(1st) vs (20th):** The top heuristic keeps per‑bin selection counts and cumulative rewards, adds a modest ε‑greedy term, and updates only after a feasible best‑bin is chosen. The worst version merely computes 1/(slack+1), applies a temperature‑scaled softmax and ε‑noise, with no state or learning.  
- **(2nd) vs (19th):** The second‑best also tracks counts/rewards and a total‑call counter, but uses a larger reward weight (0.3) and updates unconditionally after argmax. The second‑worst is identical to the 18th/20th design: static inverse‑slack scoring, softmax, ε‑noise, no learning.  
- **(1st) vs (2nd):** Both share the deterministic inverse‑slack + ε‑random core and per‑bin reward averaging. Differences: the 2nd uses a higher reward weight (0.3) and records total calls (unused), while the 1st applies a lower reward weight (0.1) and safeguards updates by confirming the selected bin is feasible.  
- **(3rd) vs (4th):** The 3rd adds a UCB exploration bonus, explicit total‑call tracking, and a smaller ε (0.15), blending deterministic, reward, and UCB terms. The 4th drops learning entirely, weighting deterministic slack by a static reward factor based on max capacity, then returns softmax probabilities.  
- **(19th) vs (20th):** These two are identical duplicates of the simple softmax + ε‑noise scheme; no distinction in behavior or performance.  
- **Overall:** The highest‑ranked heuristics combine a lightweight online learning loop (counts, avg reward) with inverse‑slack scoring and modest ε‑exploration, occasionally enriched by UCB. Lower‑ranked versions either discard learning, over‑engineer without clear benefit, or duplicate earlier ideas, leading to stagnation.

**Experience:**  
Maintain minimal per‑bin statistics (counts, avg reward), use inverse slack for tight‑fit bias, add a small ε‑greedy term, and optionally a lightweight UCB bonus. Keep updates simple and only after feasible selections; avoid unnecessary complexity or duplicated code.
