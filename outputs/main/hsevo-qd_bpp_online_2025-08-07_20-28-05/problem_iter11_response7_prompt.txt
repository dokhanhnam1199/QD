Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combine inverse slack and negative squared slack with epsilon\u2011greedy randomness for balanced tight\u2011fit and exploration.\"\"\"\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not feasible.any():\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    leftover = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    epsilon = 0.2\n    beta = 0.01\n    deterministic = 1.0 / (leftover + 1e-9) - beta * (leftover ** 2)\n    random_part = np.random.rand(feasible.sum())\n    scores = (1 - epsilon) * deterministic + epsilon * random_part\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    priorities[feasible] = scores\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    epsilon = 0.15\n    w_inv = 0.5\n    w_lin = 0.3\n    w_sq = 0.2\n    temperature = 1.0\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    slack = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    core = w_inv / (slack + 1.0) - w_lin * slack - w_sq * slack**2\n    rand = np.random.rand(feasible.sum())\n    scores_feasible = (1 - epsilon) * core + epsilon * rand\n    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    scores[feasible] = scores_feasible\n    max_score = np.max(scores_feasible)\n    exp_scores = np.exp((scores_feasible - max_score) / temperature)\n    probs_feasible = exp_scores / exp_scores.sum()\n    probs = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    probs[feasible] = probs_feasible\n    return probs\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see the best heuristic (#1) uses a lightweight deterministic inverse\u2011slack score with a simple epsilon\u2011greedy reward adjustment and clear state updates, whereas the worst (#20) blends UCB, temperature decay, noise, and multiple slack metrics, adding unnecessary complexity and risk of overfitting;  \n(Second best) vs (second worst), we see #2 (identical to #1) again shows the simplicity advantage, while #19 (UCB\u2011based) mirrors the worst in complexity, reinforcing that added components do not necessarily improve outcomes;  \nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are functionally identical, exposing duplicate implementation and a maintainability issue;  \n(3rd) vs (4th), the two are identical as well, again highlighting redundant code;  \nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no difference\u2014they implement the same UCB/temperature logic\u2014illustrating lack of diversity in the lower\u2011ranked heuristics;  \nOverall: The top heuristics are simple, score\u2011direct, and learn from empirical reward; the bottom heuristics over\u2011engineer with multi\u2011metric blending and hidden selection logic, leading to reduced clarity and potential performance loss.\n- \n- **Keywords:** simplicity, modularity, deterministic, explainability, balanced scoring.  \n- **Advice:** Build a single, stateless scoring function that linearly combines normalized slack and empirical reward, separate feature extraction, and enforce explicit infeasibility handling.  \n- **Avoid:** Random \u03b5\u2011greedy tweaks, softmax probability layers, hidden state, duplicated code, and excess hyper\u2011parameters.  \n- **Explanation:** A deterministic, modular pipeline yields transparent heuristics that are easy to maintain, debug, and compose while still capturing key trade\u2011offs.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
