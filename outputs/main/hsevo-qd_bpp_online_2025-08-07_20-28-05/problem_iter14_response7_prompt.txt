Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combine inverse slack and negative squared slack with epsilon\u2011greedy randomness for balanced tight\u2011fit and exploration.\"\"\"\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not feasible.any():\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    leftover = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    epsilon = 0.2\n    beta = 0.01\n    deterministic = 1.0 / (leftover + 1e-9) - beta * (leftover ** 2)\n    random_part = np.random.rand(feasible.sum())\n    scores = (1 - epsilon) * deterministic + epsilon * random_part\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    priorities[feasible] = scores\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    epsilon = 0.15\n    w_inv = 0.5\n    w_lin = 0.3\n    w_sq = 0.2\n    temperature = 1.0\n    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    if not np.any(feasible):\n        return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    slack = bins_remain_cap[feasible] - item\n    core = w_inv / (slack + 1.0) - w_lin * slack - w_sq * slack**2\n    rand = np.random.rand(feasible.sum())\n    scores_feasible = (1 - epsilon) * core + epsilon * rand\n    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n    scores[feasible] = scores_feasible\n    max_score = np.max(scores_feasible)\n    exp_scores = np.exp((scores_feasible - max_score) / temperature)\n    probs_feasible = exp_scores / exp_scores.sum()\n    probs = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    probs[feasible] = probs_feasible\n    return probs\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- - **(Best) vs (Worst):** Heuristic\u202f1st is a concise \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scorer with explicit infeasibility handling (\u2011inf). Heuristic\u202f20th wraps a full class using UCB, median\u2011based diversity, temperature decay, and extensive state. While more adaptive, it introduces substantial overhead and complexity, risking stale statistics and harder debugging.  \n- **(Second best) vs (Second worst):** Heuristic\u202f2nd duplicates the 1st implementation\u2014still robust despite lacking a docstring. Heuristic\u202f19th is a stub that returns a zero array for feasible bins, providing no meaningful priority.  \n- **(1st) vs (2nd):** The source code is identical; the ranking likely reflects external factors (e.g., runtime, hidden bug fixes) not evident here.  \n- **(3rd) vs (4th):** Both add global counters, reward tracking, and a 0.3\u2011weighted average\u2011reward term to the base score, enabling lightweight online learning. Their duplication suggests ranking differences stem from subtle initialization or performance nuances.  \n- **(Second worst) vs (Worst):** Heuristic\u202f19th (stub) offers no discrimination between bins, while Heuristic\u202f20th (complex adaptive) at least attempts to learn; the stub is thus worse.  \n- **Overall:** Top heuristics prioritize simplicity, clear \u03b5\u2011greedy inverse\u2011slack scoring, and minimal state. Mid\u2011ranked methods enrich this with linear/squared slack penalties, softmax scaling, or modest reward tracking, achieving a better balance of fit and exploration. The lowest ranks either provide no guidance (stubs) or incur excessive overhead without clear benefit.\n- \n- Keywords: size class grouping, descending order, first\u2011fit, single\u2011pass swap, rule\u2011based.  \n- Advice: Split items into large, medium, small buckets; pack each bucket by first\u2011fit in descending size; then run one pass swapping a small item from an emptier bin with a larger item from a fuller bin if it reduces the max empty space.  \n- Avoid: Random exploration, multi\u2011metric scoring, online learning, extra hyper\u2011parameters, placeholder or duplicated code, and any heavy state tracking.  \n- Explanation: This simple, rule\u2011based approach uses only item size, runs in linear time, and improves bin utilization without complex scores or hidden randomness.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
