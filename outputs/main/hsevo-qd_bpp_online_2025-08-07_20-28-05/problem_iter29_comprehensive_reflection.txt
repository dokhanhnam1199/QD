- **Keywords:** modularity, type‑safety, offline analysis, domain‑specific metrics, vectorization, reproducibility.  
- **Advice:** decompose the heuristic into steps (feasibility test, cost estimate, selection); compute scores from metrics such as space utilization, geometry fit, and load balance; use immutable data structures and type hints; rely on vectorized NumPy ops and memoize sub‑computations; document each step with unit tests.  
- **Avoid:** ad‑hoc metric blends, hidden mutable state, unnecessary hyper‑parameters, duplicated logic, non‑deterministic randomness.  
- **Explanation:** A clear, modular pipeline with immutable, typed data and analytically derived scores stays fast, testable, and easy to maintain while leveraging rich problem‑specific information.
