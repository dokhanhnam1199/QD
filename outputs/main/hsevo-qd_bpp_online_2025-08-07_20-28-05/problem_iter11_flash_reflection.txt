**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see the best heuristic (#1) uses a lightweight deterministic inverse‑slack score with a simple epsilon‑greedy reward adjustment and clear state updates, whereas the worst (#20) blends UCB, temperature decay, noise, and multiple slack metrics, adding unnecessary complexity and risk of overfitting;  
(Second best) vs (second worst), we see #2 (identical to #1) again shows the simplicity advantage, while #19 (UCB‑based) mirrors the worst in complexity, reinforcing that added components do not necessarily improve outcomes;  
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are functionally identical, exposing duplicate implementation and a maintainability issue;  
(3rd) vs (4th), the two are identical as well, again highlighting redundant code;  
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no difference—they implement the same UCB/temperature logic—illustrating lack of diversity in the lower‑ranked heuristics;  
Overall: The top heuristics are simple, score‑direct, and learn from empirical reward; the bottom heuristics over‑engineer with multi‑metric blending and hidden selection logic, leading to reduced clarity and potential performance loss.

**Experience:**
Prioritize simple, explainable scoring that balances slack and empirical reward. Avoid overcomplicated mixtures of metrics, excessive randomness, or internal state that forces hidden selection logic. Duplicated code indicates a maintenance smell. Use clear function boundaries and deterministic outputs for easier composability.
