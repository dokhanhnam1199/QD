Prioritize feasibility first, then fill ratio. Introduce randomness and waste minimization for exploration and refinement.

Simplicity and directness often outperform complex heuristics. Normalization is beneficial for generalizing across instances.

The better code uses tighter fit bonuses, log penalties, and normalization for improved bin packing.

Prioritize tight fits and smaller bins when waste is equal. Avoid near-full bin penalties.

Prioritize feasibility, best-fit, and filling bins effectively, while penalizing large remaining capacities.

Focus on simplicity, direct waste minimization, and breaking ties effectively using bin capacity.

Prioritize fill ratio *after* packing. Use tighter, adaptive thresholds and avoid unnecessary normalization.

Prioritize feasibility. Target good fill ratios, penalize near-full bins, and avoid normalization.

Simplicity and direct optimization (minimizing waste) often outperform complex, hand-tuned heuristics.

Prioritize tight fits, fill ratios, and penalize excessive remaining capacity directly and simply.
