Minimize waste, prioritize near-full bins, and only consider infeasible bins when necessary.

Prioritize fitting, best-fit, and filling bins. Penalize large waste and infeasible bins, using weighted bonuses/penalties.

Prioritize tighter fits. Explicitly penalize infeasible bins. Normalize priorities for better exploration.

Prioritize minimal waste. Break ties by favoring smaller bins and forbidding infeasible assignments.

Prioritize tight fits; heavily penalize infeasibility; subtly favor smaller bins among equal-waste options.

Prioritize feasible bins with tighter fits. Discourage infeasible bins strongly. Consider normalization for finer control.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste, add randomness to break ties, and strongly penalize infeasible options.

Focus on tight fit, item utilization within the bin, and penalizing underutilized bins.

Prioritize fitting, best-fit, and near-full bins. Penalize large waste and infeasible fits for improved bin packing.

The better code uses `fill_ratios - log(remaining_space)` which balances bin utilization and avoiding near-full bins.
