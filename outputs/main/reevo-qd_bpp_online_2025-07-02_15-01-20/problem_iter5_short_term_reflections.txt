Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize large remaining capacity. Consider thresholds and scaling for better performance.

Prioritize near-fits aggressively, and penalize bins with large remaining capacity in reasonable fits.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize waste. Explicitly handle infeasible cases for better performance.

Prioritize minimal waste and penalize excessive free space within bins.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Discourage infeasible placements. Use remaining capacity ratio as a penalty.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize wasted space and infeasible solutions using rules and scaling.

Smaller "almost fit" range and sharper penalty/reward distinctions improve packing density.

Prioritize near-fits using inverse waste. Penalize larger remaining capacity in reasonable fits more strongly.

Prioritize minimal waste and penalize bins with high remaining capacity to improve packing efficiency.

Focus on tighter near-fit ranges and capacity-aware penalties. Prioritize minimal waste and avoid excessive fragmentation.
