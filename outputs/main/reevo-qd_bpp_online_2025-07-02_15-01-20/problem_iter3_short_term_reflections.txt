Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize wasted space, and avoid infeasible assignments. Consider capacity scaling and thresholds.

Prioritize perfect fits, near fits, and then fitting bins, penalizing wasted space. Avoid bins that don't fit.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize excessive remaining capacity. Consider absolute/relative waste.

The better code prioritizes perfect/near fits and penalizes excessive waste, improving bin utilization.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Directly optimizing for waste and penalizing large empty space improves packing.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize wasted space and infeasible assignments. Consider capacity scaling.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Explicit rules beat direct ratio calculations. Waste minimization is key. Consider penalties for excessive space.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Penalize excessive waste and infeasible placements. Consider capacity ratios.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize large remaining capacities and infeasible bins using thresholds.

Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize large remaining capacities, and avoid infeasible bins. Directly optimizing waste is beneficial.
