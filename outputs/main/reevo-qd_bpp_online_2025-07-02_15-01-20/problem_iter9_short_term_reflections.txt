Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize waste, and scale rewards based on remaining bin capacity.

Focus on tighter near-fit ranges, direct waste minimization, and penalizing large remaining capacities.

Prioritize tighter fits (10% vs 20%), and refine penalty for bins with higher remaining capacity (0.6 vs 0.5).

Smaller "almost fit" range (10% vs 20%), stronger penalty for empty space, and avoid division by zero.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize excessive waste less harshly, and scale rewards appropriately.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Directly encode domain knowledge (fitting rules) and penalize excessive waste.

Prioritize perfect/near fits, penalize waste, and use a relevant capacity scaling for feasible bins.

Prioritize minimal waste and penalize high remaining capacity more aggressively for better bin utilization.

Narrowing "almost fit" (30% to 5%) and reducing the "free space" penalty improved performance. Focus on tighter fit and balanced bin usage.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Control waste, penalize excessive capacity, and handle infeasibility explicitly.
