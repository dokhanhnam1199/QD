Prioritize near fits with waste minimization; balance exploration and exploitation of bin capacity.

The better code uses a wider "almost fit" range, less aggressive reward for it, and less penalty for excessive space.

Prioritize feasible, near-perfect fits. Discourage large waste and favor dense packing using capacity ratios.

Prioritize perfect/tight fits. Penalize large remaining capacities non-linearly. Explicitly handle infeasibility.

Prioritize near-perfect fits. Penalize excessive remaining capacity. Adjust thresholds based on problem specifics.

Prioritize tighter fits (5% vs 20%), penalize larger remaining capacity more, and prevent division by zero.

Prioritize tighter almost-fits (20% vs. 30%). Reduce penalty for larger remaining capacity in general fits.

Tighter "almost fit" range (10% vs 30%) and reduced large-capacity bin penalty improve performance.

Prioritize near-fits with a wider margin (5%), penalize excessive waste less harshly, and scale fitting bin priority.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize excessive waste, and ensure infeasibility is handled correctly for online bin packing.
