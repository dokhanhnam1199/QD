Prioritize perfect/near fits more aggressively. Adjust near-fit range. Penalize waste effectively.

Prioritize perfect/near-perfect fits. Penalize excessive free space. Handle infeasibility explicitly.

Smaller "almost fit" range (10% vs 30%) and reduced large bin penalty (0.6 vs 0.7) improve packing.

Prioritize perfect/near fits with adjusted ranges and inverse waste; penalize remaining ratio.

Smaller "almost fit" range (20% vs 30%), stronger "almost fit" priority, and weaker "too much free space" penalty improve performance.

The better code prioritizes minimizing waste and uses more effective scaling/penalties for bin selection.

Prioritize perfect/near fits. Penalize large waste. Explicit rules often outperform simple functions.

Prioritize near-perfect fits more aggressively. Penalize bins with large remaining capacity after packing.

Prioritize near-fits using inverse waste. Penalize large remaining capacity more aggressively.

The better code prioritizes tighter fits and avoids excessive free space, resulting in denser bin packing.
