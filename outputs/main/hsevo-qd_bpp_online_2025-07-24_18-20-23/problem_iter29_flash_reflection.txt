**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a nuanced combination of relative fit and proportion of capacity used, with careful normalization and differentiation among viable bins. In contrast, the worst heuristic relies on a Gaussian-like function and adds random noise to priorities. The top heuristics generally use more sophisticated and nuanced calculations for priority scores, such as combining relative fit and proportion of capacity used. They also often apply more refined normalization techniques. Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, both use similar strategies but with slight differences in calculation and differentiation. The 1st heuristic uses a logarithmic function for proportion used, while the 2nd uses a simple proportion. The worst heuristics (like 20th) tend to rely on simpler or less nuanced strategies, such as using a Gaussian-like function without considering the proportion of capacity used. Overall, the better heuristics tend to have more complex and nuanced priority calculations, more sophisticated normalization, and differentiation strategies.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on nuanced priority calculations combining multiple factors, use sophisticated normalization techniques, and differentiate among viable bins. Avoid overly simplistic strategies and consider the proportion of capacity used and relative fit.
