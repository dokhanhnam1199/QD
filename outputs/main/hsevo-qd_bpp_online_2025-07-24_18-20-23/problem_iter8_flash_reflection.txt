**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a combination of strategies, prioritizes bins with remaining capacity closest to the item size, and normalizes valid bin priorities. In contrast, the worst heuristic combines fit priority and fullness priority but lacks the nuanced normalization and prioritization seen in the top heuristics. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both use similar strategies but with slight differences in normalization. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, indicating potential redundancy. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see similar structures but with differences in scaling and combining priorities. Overall, effective heuristics tend to combine multiple strategies, prioritize bins based on remaining capacity relative to the item size, ensure numerical stability, and normalize or scale priorities to enhance differentiation among viable bins.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple strategies, nuanced prioritization based on remaining capacity, numerical stability, and effective normalization or scaling of priorities. Avoid redundancy and ensure differentiation among viable bins.
