To provide a useful response, let's analyze the given 'Current self-reflection' and 'Ineffective self-reflection'.

Upon examination, it appears that 'Current self-reflection' emphasizes combining multiple strategies, nuanced prioritization, and effective normalization, while avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundancy. 'Ineffective self-reflection', on the other hand, seems to reiterate similar points, but with some repetition and less clarity.

Here's a redefined 'Current self-reflection' in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Nuanced prioritization, multiple strategies, normalization, differentiation.
* **Advice**: Combine relative fit and proportion of capacity used with effective normalization and differentiation among viable bins.
* **Avoid**: Unnecessary complexity, redundancy, and repetition in heuristic designs.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and combining multiple strategies, we can design more effective heuristics that avoid common pitfalls, leading to better performance and robustness.
