**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic uses a more nuanced approach with epsilon to avoid division by zero and prioritizes bins based on remaining capacity closest to the item size. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st heuristic uses epsilon for numerical stability, while the 2nd heuristic combines multiple prioritization strategies. 
(2nd) vs (19th) shows that both use a combination of strategies, but (2nd) is more complex. 
(3rd) vs (18th) shows similar patterns in prioritizing bins based on remaining capacity. 
Overall, top heuristics tend to use more sophisticated combinations of strategies and numerical stability measures.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, combine multiple prioritization strategies and consider numerical stability to handle edge cases, leading to more robust and effective solutions.
