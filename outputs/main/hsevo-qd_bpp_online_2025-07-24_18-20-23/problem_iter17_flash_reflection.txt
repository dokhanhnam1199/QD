**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of relative fit and proportion of capacity used, with nuanced normalization. 
The top heuristics (1st-5th) utilize a similar formula for calculating priority scores, with slight variations in the normalization and differentiation strategies. 
In contrast, the lower-ranked heuristics (15th-20th) employ different strategies, such as using a Gaussian-like function or combining fit priority with fullness priority. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic uses a more straightforward normalization, while the second heuristic adds a small epsilon for numerical stability. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows identical code, suggesting that minor variations in the implementation do not significantly impact performance. 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to use a combination of relative fit and proportion of capacity used, with careful normalization and differentiation strategies.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, combine relative fit and proportion of capacity used, and carefully consider normalization and differentiation strategies to prioritize bins effectively.
