**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st to 7th) with the worst (14th to 20th), we see that the top heuristics use a combination of strategies to prioritize bins, including relative fit, proportion of capacity used, and absolute remaining capacity. They also normalize priorities to ensure numerical stability. In contrast, the worst heuristics either repeat the same strategy or introduce unnecessary complexity. Comparing (1st) vs (8th), we see that the top heuristic uses a more nuanced normalization and considers both relative fit and proportion of capacity used. (8th) vs (9th) shows that a small difference in epsilon value doesn't significantly impact performance. (9th) vs (10th) indicates that introducing an optimal epsilon is crucial. Overall, a good heuristic should combine multiple strategies, normalize priorities, and avoid unnecessary complexity.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, combine multiple strategies like relative fit and proportion of capacity used, normalize priorities for numerical stability, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
