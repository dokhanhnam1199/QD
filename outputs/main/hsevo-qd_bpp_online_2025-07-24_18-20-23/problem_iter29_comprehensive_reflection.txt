To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information. 

* Keywords: Nuanced prioritization, multiple strategies, normalization, differentiation among viable bins.
* Advice: Combine multiple factors for priority calculations and use sophisticated normalization techniques to differentiate among viable bins effectively.
* Avoid: Overly simplistic strategies, redundancy, unnecessary complexity, and randomness.
* Explanation: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and combining multiple strategies with effective normalization, we can create more robust and effective heuristics that differentiate among viable bins and enhance packing efficiency.
