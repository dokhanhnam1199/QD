To redefine 'Current self-reflection' and avoid 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

* Keywords: Multiple strategies, nuanced prioritization, numerical stability, normalization, differentiation.
* Advice: Combine strategies like relative fit and proportion of capacity used, ensuring nuanced prioritization and normalization for numerical stability.
* Avoid: Unnecessary complexity, redundancy, and ineffective handling of edge cases.
* Explanation: By integrating multiple strategies and focusing on nuanced prioritization and normalization, we can design more robust and effective heuristics that differentiate among viable options and maintain numerical stability.
