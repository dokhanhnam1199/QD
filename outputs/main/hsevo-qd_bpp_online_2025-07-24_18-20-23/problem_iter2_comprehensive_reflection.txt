To improve heuristics, let's rethink "Current self-reflection." Since "Ineffective self-reflection" is None, we'll focus on enhancing the existing approach.

* **Keywords**: Prioritization, bin capacity, combination of priorities
* **Advice**: Explore diverse prioritization strategies and evaluate their effectiveness in various scenarios.
* **Avoid**: Over-reliance on a single prioritization method, neglecting edge cases.
* **Explanation**: By diversifying prioritization strategies and considering multiple scenarios, we can develop more robust and adaptable heuristics, ultimately leading to better optimization outcomes.
