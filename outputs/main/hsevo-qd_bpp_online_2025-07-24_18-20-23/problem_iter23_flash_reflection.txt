**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we observe that the top heuristic combines relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization, whereas the worst relies on a Gaussian-like function with random noise. 
The top heuristics (1st-5th) generally emphasize nuanced normalization and differentiation among viable bins, while the bottom ones (16th-20th) either lack these aspects or introduce unnecessary complexity.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see a slight variation in the formula used for calculating priorities, with the 1st using a logarithmic term. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows a similar pattern, with both using relative fit and proportion used, but differing in their normalization approach. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both use a Gaussian-like function, but the worst adds random noise.
Overall, the top heuristics tend to focus on a balanced and nuanced approach to prioritization, while the lower-ranked ones either overcomplicate or oversimplify the prioritization logic.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization techniques, and differentiate among viable bins to enhance packing efficiency. Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity or randomness.
