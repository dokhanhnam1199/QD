    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is higher for bins that have enough capacity for the item and 
    have less remaining capacity, as this suggests a better fit.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    # We want to prioritize bins that can fit the item and have less remaining capacity
    # So, we use the negative of the remaining capacity for bins that can fit the item
    # and a very low value (e.g., negative infinity) for bins that cannot fit the item
