To design better heuristics, let's refine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding the repetitive and less effective aspects found in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach in 4 bullet points:

* **Keywords**: Nuanced prioritization, multiple strategies, normalization, differentiation.
* **Advice**: Combine relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization to enhance prioritization and ensure differentiation among viable bins.
* **Avoid**: Redundancy, unnecessary complexity, and ineffective handling of edge cases.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and combining multiple strategies while ensuring normalization and differentiation, we can create more robust and effective heuristics that handle various scenarios efficiently.
