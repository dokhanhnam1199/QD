Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization for online bin packing.\n    Prioritizes bins where the item fits with a reasonable remainder and differentiates among viable options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate priority score based on relative fit and proportion of capacity used\n    epsilon = 1e-6  # Small value for numerical stability\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    relative_fit = 1 -
