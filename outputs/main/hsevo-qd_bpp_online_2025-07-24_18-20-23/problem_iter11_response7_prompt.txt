Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

They also normalize priorities to ensure numerical stability. In contrast, the worst heuristics either repeat the same strategy or introduce unnecessary complexity. Comparing (1st) vs (8th), we see that the top heuristic uses a more nuanced normalization and considers both relative fit and proportion of capacity used. (8th) vs (9th) shows that a small difference in epsilon value doesn't significantly impact performance. (9th) vs (10th) indicates that introducing an optimal epsilon is crucial. Overall, a good heuristic should combine multiple strategies, normalize priorities, and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n- \nTo redefine 'Current self-reflection' and avoid 'Ineffective self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.\n\n* Keywords: Multiple strategies, nuanced prioritization, numerical stability, normalization, differentiation.\n* Advice: Combine strategies like relative fit and proportion of capacity used, ensuring nuanced prioritization and normalization for numerical stability.\n* Avoid: Unnecessary complexity, redundancy, and ineffective handling of edge cases.\n* Explanation: By integrating multiple strategies and focusing on nuanced prioritization and normalization, we can design more robust and effective heuristics that differentiate among viable options and maintain numerical stability.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
