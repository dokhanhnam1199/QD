To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection' while avoiding 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's the analysis:

* **Keywords**: Nuanced prioritization, numerical stability, normalization, differentiation.
* **Advice**: Combine multiple strategies with careful consideration of remaining capacity and prioritize based on nuanced factors.
* **Avoid**: Redundancy, ineffective prioritization, and lack of differentiation among viable options.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and numerical stability, and avoiding redundancy, we can create more robust and effective heuristics that handle different scenarios and edge cases, ultimately leading to better solutions.
