In contrast, the worst heuristic relies on a Gaussian-like function and adds random noise to priorities. The top heuristics generally use more sophisticated and nuanced calculations for priority scores, such as combining relative fit and proportion of capacity used. They also often apply more refined normalization techniques. Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, both use similar strategies but with slight differences in calculation and differentiation. The 1st heuristic uses a logarithmic function for proportion used, while the 2nd uses a simple proportion. The worst heuristics (like 20th) tend to rely on simpler or less nuanced strategies, such as using a Gaussian-like function without considering the proportion of capacity used. Overall, the better heuristics tend to have more complex and nuanced priority calculations, more sophisticated normalization, and differentiation strategies.\n- \nTo redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information. \n\n* Keywords: Nuanced prioritization, multiple strategies, normalization, differentiation among viable bins.\n* Advice: Combine multiple factors for priority calculations and use sophisticated normalization techniques to differentiate among viable bins effectively.\n* Avoid: Overly simplistic strategies, redundancy, unnecessary complexity, and randomness.\n* Explanation: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and combining multiple strategies with effective normalization, we can create more robust and effective heuristics that differentiate among viable bins and enhance packing efficiency.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
