{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on combining multiple strategies, nuanced prioritization based on remaining capacity, numerical stability, and effective normalization or scaling of priorities. Avoid redundancy and ensure differentiation among viable bins.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nTo design better heuristics, focus on minimizing waste by prioritizing bins based on remaining capacity after adding the item, and consider using a combination of priorities to effectively handle different scenarios.\n\nTo design better heuristics, combine multiple prioritization strategies and consider numerical stability to handle edge cases, leading to more robust and effective solutions.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
