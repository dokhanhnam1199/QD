**Analysis:**
Comparing the top-ranked heuristics, we observe a consistent use of a combination of relative fit and proportion of capacity used. For instance, Heuristics 1st and 2nd both employ a nuanced normalization strategy and differentiate among viable bins. 
Heuristics 1st uses `relative_fit * proportion_used` while Heuristics 2nd uses `(1 - np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item) / item) * np.log(item / (bins_remain_cap - item + item) + 1)`, indicating a variation in the calculation of priority scores.
In contrast, lower-ranked heuristics like Heuristics 19th and 20th use a Gaussian-like function `np.exp(-((bins_remain_cap - item) / item) ** 2)` to prioritize bins, which is simpler but less effective.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first heuristic uses a more straightforward calculation for `priority`, while the second heuristic introduces a logarithmic factor.
(3rd) vs (4th) shows identical implementations, indicating potential redundancy or a strong similarity in effective strategies.
Overall, top heuristics tend to combine multiple factors (relative fit, proportion used, and nuanced normalization) and differentiate among viable bins, suggesting that a balanced approach is key to their effectiveness.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization, and differentiate among viable bins to enhance prioritization.
