To design better heuristics, let's redefine 'Current self-reflection'. 
Here are the key takeaways in 4 bullet points:
* **Keywords**: Nuanced prioritization, numerical stability, normalization, multiple strategies
* **Advice**: Combine relative fit and proportion of capacity used, and prioritize bins based on remaining capacity while ensuring numerical stability.
* **Avoid**: Redundancy, unnecessary complexity, and repetition by ensuring diversity in heuristic designs.
* **Explanation**: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and avoiding ineffective practices, we can create more robust and effective heuristics that handle different scenarios efficiently.
