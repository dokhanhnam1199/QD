To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze and merge the given information.

* Keywords: nuanced prioritization, normalization, diversity, numerical stability, remaining capacity
* Advice: 
    - Combine multiple prioritization strategies
    - Normalize priorities for numerical stability
    - Focus on nuanced prioritization based on remaining capacity
    - Ensure differentiation among viable options
* Avoid: 
    - Repetition and redundancy
    - Unnecessary complexity
    - Ineffective handling of edge cases
* Explanation: By merging the insights and avoiding the pitfalls, we can design better heuristics that effectively handle different scenarios and edge cases by combining multiple strategies and normalizing priorities.
