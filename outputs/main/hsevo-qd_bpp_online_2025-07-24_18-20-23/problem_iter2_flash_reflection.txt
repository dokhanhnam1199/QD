**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristic prioritizes bins based on the remaining capacity after adding the item, with a focus on minimizing waste. In contrast, the worst heuristic uses a similar approach but with a less effective combination of priorities. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that both use a similar approach but the 1st one directly uses the negative remaining capacity, while the 2nd one uses the absolute difference between the remaining capacity and the item size. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows that the 3rd is identical to the 2nd, while the 4th uses a more complex heuristic that penalizes bins that would be left with too much or too little remaining capacity.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that they are identical, indicating a repetition in the list.
Overall, the top heuristics tend to focus on minimizing waste by prioritizing bins that are closest to being full or have the least remaining capacity after adding the item.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on minimizing waste by prioritizing bins based on remaining capacity after adding the item, and consider using a combination of priorities to effectively handle different scenarios.
