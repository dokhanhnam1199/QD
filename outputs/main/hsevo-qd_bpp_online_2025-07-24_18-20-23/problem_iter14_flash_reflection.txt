**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristics (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the top heuristics tend to use more nuanced normalization and prioritization strategies, such as combining relative fit and proportion of capacity used. The worst heuristics, while similar in structure, lack the fine-tuned adjustments seen in the top ones. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical, suggesting a potential tie or overfitting in the ranking. (3rd) vs (4th) shows a difference in calculation of `priorities`, with (3rd) using a slightly different formula. (19th) vs (20th) are identical, indicating repetition in the list. Overall, top heuristics tend to have more sophisticated prioritization and normalization, while the worst ones are either repetitive or lack these nuances.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on nuanced prioritization strategies and normalization techniques, and avoid repetition by ensuring diversity in the heuristic designs.
