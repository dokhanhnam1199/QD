Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines relative fit, proportion of capacity used, and nuanced normalization for online bin packing.\n    Prioritizes bins with remaining capacity closest to item size and differentiates among viable options.\n    \"\"\"\n    epsilon = 1e-6  # Small value for numerical stability\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    # Relative fit strategy from priority_v0\n    relative_fit = 1 - np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item) / (item + epsilon)\n    proportion_used = item / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon)\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins, relative_fit * proportion_used, -1.0)\n    \n    # Normalization and differentiation strategy inspired by priority_v1\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        max_priority = np.max(priority)\n        if max_priority > -1.0:  \n            priority = np.where(priority > -1.0, priority / max_priority, priority)\n        # Further differentiate among bins that can fit the item with high remaining capacity\n        priority = np.where((bins_remain_cap >= item) & (bins_remain_cap > item * 2),\n                            priority * 0.9,  # Slightly reduce priority for bins with high remaining capacity\n                            priority)\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines strategies: prioritizes bins with remaining capacity closest to item size,\n    ensures numerical stability with epsilon, and normalizes valid bin priorities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if bins can fit the item and calculate priority\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)\n    priority = np.where(valid_bins, -diff + 1 / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon), -np.inf)\n    \n    # Normalize priority scores for valid bins\n    valid_bins = priority != -np.inf\n    if np.any(valid_bins):\n        max_priority = np.max(priority[valid_bins])\n        priority[valid_bins] = np.exp(-(max_priority - priority[valid_bins]))\n    \n    return priority\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing the top-ranked heuristics, we observe a consistent use of a combination of relative fit and proportion of capacity used. For instance, Heuristics 1st and 2nd both employ a nuanced normalization strategy and differentiate among viable bins. \nHeuristics 1st uses `relative_fit * proportion_used` while Heuristics 2nd uses `(1 - np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item) / item) * np.log(item / (bins_remain_cap - item + item) + 1)`, indicating a variation in the calculation of priority scores.\nIn contrast, lower-ranked heuristics like Heuristics 19th and 20th use a Gaussian-like function `np.exp(-((bins_remain_cap - item) / item) ** 2)` to prioritize bins, which is simpler but less effective.\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first heuristic uses a more straightforward calculation for `priority`, while the second heuristic introduces a logarithmic factor.\n(3rd) vs (4th) shows identical implementations, indicating potential redundancy or a strong similarity in effective strategies.\nOverall, top heuristics tend to combine multiple factors (relative fit, proportion used, and nuanced normalization) and differentiate among viable bins, suggesting that a balanced approach is key to their effectiveness.\n- \nTo design better heuristics, let's refine 'Current self-reflection' by avoiding the repetitive and less effective aspects found in 'Ineffective self-reflection'. Here's a redefined approach in 4 bullet points:\n\n* **Keywords**: Nuanced prioritization, multiple strategies, normalization, differentiation.\n* **Advice**: Combine relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization to enhance prioritization and ensure differentiation among viable bins.\n* **Avoid**: Redundancy, unnecessary complexity, and ineffective handling of edge cases.\n* **Explanation**: By focusing on nuanced prioritization and combining multiple strategies while ensuring normalization and differentiation, we can create more robust and effective heuristics that handle various scenarios efficiently.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
