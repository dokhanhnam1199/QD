Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a more sophisticated heuristic.\n\n    The heuristic used here is a variant of the 'First-Fit Decreasing' algorithm adapted for online bin packing.\n    It prioritizes bins that have just enough capacity for the item, and penalizes bins that would be left with too much or too little remaining capacity.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the priority score for each bin based on the remaining capacity\n    # We want to prioritize bins where the item fits exactly or leaves a small remainder\n    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, \n                          1 - np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item) / item,  # Prioritize bins with remaining capacity close to the item size\n                          -1.0)  # Penalize bins that can't fit the item\n    \n    # Ensure that bins that can't fit the item have a lower priority than any bin that can fit the item\n    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, priorities - np.max(priorities), priorities)\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nTo improve heuristics, let's rethink \"Current self-reflection.\" Since \"Ineffective self-reflection\" is None, we'll focus on enhancing the existing approach.\n\n* **Keywords**: Prioritization, bin capacity, combination of priorities\n* **Advice**: Explore diverse prioritization strategies and evaluate their effectiveness in various scenarios.\n* **Avoid**: Over-reliance on a single prioritization method, neglecting edge cases.\n* **Explanation**: By diversifying prioritization strategies and considering multiple scenarios, we can develop more robust and adaptable heuristics, ultimately leading to better optimization outcomes.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
