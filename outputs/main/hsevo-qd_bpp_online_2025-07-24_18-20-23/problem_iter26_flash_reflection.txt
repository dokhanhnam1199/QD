**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the best heuristic combines relative fit and proportion of capacity used with nuanced normalization, while the worst heuristic uses a Gaussian-like function to prioritize bins. 
The top heuristics (1st-5th) generally use a combination of relative fit and proportion of capacity used, with varying normalization and differentiation strategies. 
In contrast, the lower-ranked heuristics (15th-20th) use more diverse strategies, such as exponential functions and random noise. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see similar strategies with slight variations in normalization and differentiation. 
(3rd) vs (4th) also show similar strategies, with the main difference being in the order of operations. 
Overall, the top heuristics tend to use more straightforward and interpretable strategies, while the lower-ranked heuristics use more complex and varied approaches.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on combining interpretable strategies like relative fit and proportion of capacity used, and experiment with different normalization and differentiation techniques to optimize performance.
