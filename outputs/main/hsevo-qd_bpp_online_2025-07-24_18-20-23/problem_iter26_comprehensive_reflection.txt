To redesign 'Current self-reflection', let's analyze the given information.

* Keywords: 
    - Multiple strategies
    - Nuanced prioritization
    - Normalization
    - Differentiation
* Advice: 
    - Combine relative fit and proportion of capacity used
    - Experiment with normalization techniques to enhance prioritization
* Avoid: 
    - Redundancy
    - Unnecessary complexity
    - Repetition
* Explanation: By focusing on a mix of strategies and nuanced prioritization with effective normalization, we can create more robust heuristics that differentiate among viable options efficiently.
