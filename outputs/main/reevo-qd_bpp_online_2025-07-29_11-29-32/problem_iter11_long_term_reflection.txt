1. **Dynamic Heuristic Blending**: Adaptively combine Best Fit (large items, slack aversion) and Worst Fit (small items, space preservation) via item-size-dependent residual weights, avoiding rigid thresholds for smooth transitions.  

2. **Residual Space Prioritization**: Continuously score bins using size-adjusted formulas—min slack for large items, max residual for small—enhancing alignment between item size and bin capacity.  

3. **Feasibility-Driven Allocation**: Impose strict penalties (e.g., negative infinity) for capacity violations; prioritize bins where residual capacity closely matches item size.  

4. **Threshold-Free Adaptation**: Replace fixed size thresholds with ratio-based weighting—blend strategies proportionally to item dimensions for robust, flexible packing.
