Use size thresholds (>0.5) to split strategies: Best Fit for large items (minimize slack), Worst Fit for small. Blend smoothly via adaptive weights around thresholds, prioritize feasible bins with least residual space. Simplify rules, validate thresholds empirically, avoid non-linear penalties for efficiency.
