Use item size thresholds (e.g., >0.5) to assign Best Fit (large items, minimize slack) and Worst Fit (small items, preserve capacity). Blend strategies linearly, prioritize feasible bins, and exclude invalid ones. Validate thresholds empirically; favor simplicityâ€”avoid non-linear penalties and consider simple heuristics like First Fit when adaptive methods underperform. (47 words)
