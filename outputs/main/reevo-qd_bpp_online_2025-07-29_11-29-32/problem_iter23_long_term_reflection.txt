Use item-size thresholds (e.g., >0.5 → Best Fit; ≤0.5 → Worst Fit) to blend strategies linearly. Prioritize feasible bins with minimal leftover space, mask invalid with -∞, and penalize excess slack simply. Favor simplicity—validate thresholds empirically, avoid adaptive overengineering, and leverage problem structure for tight fits. (49 words)
