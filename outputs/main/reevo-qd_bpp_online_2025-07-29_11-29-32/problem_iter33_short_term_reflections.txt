Blend Best/Worst Fit heuristics using empirical item-size thresholds. Adaptive prioritization beats static approaches.
Use strategy blending: large items (>= 0.7) use Best Fit for tight fits; small items use Worst Fit to preserve flexibility. Threshold empirically tuned for balance.
Use adaptive thresholds, blend Fit strategies by item size, prioritize space efficiency, and validate bin feasibility first.
Incorporate item size to dynamically adjust target residual, penalize deviation via squared error, blending Best/Worst Fit based on item size.
Adapt thresholds; blend best/worst fit. Prioritize slack minimization for large items, flexibility preservation for small. Context-aware strategies outperform static ones.
Combine BF for large items (minimize slack) and adaptive slack preservation for small items with deterministic tie-breakers. Separate strategies by item size.
Prioritize dynamic weight adjustment, residual space exploitation, and constraint-aware scoring. Balance heuristics based on item size.
Use dynamic thresholds to adapt strategies based on item size distributions and bin states, balancing space utilization and future flexibility.
