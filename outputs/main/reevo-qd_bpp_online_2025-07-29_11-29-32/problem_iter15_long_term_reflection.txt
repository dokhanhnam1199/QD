Use size thresholds (e.g., â‰¥0.5) to blend Best/Worst Fit: prioritize tight fits for large items, space for small. Favor simple deterministic rules, math-optimized thresholds over adaptive penalties. Prioritize feasible bins. Balance residual minimization with flexibility; validate empirically for efficiency.
