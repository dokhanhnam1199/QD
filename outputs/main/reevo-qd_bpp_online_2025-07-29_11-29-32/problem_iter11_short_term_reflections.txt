Adaptively blend Best Fit and Worst Fit based on item size. Use dynamic weights for residual space, prioritizing tight fits for larger items.
Adapt strategies based on item size thresholds. Combine heuristics: Best Fit for large items, Worst Fit for small. Prioritize minimal slack for critical fits, max capacity for flexible slots. Balance bin utilization and leftover space.
"Adaptive priority blending Best/Worst Fit via item size, balancing slack and reserve space dynamically." (16 words)
Blend best-fit for large items, worst-fit for small using adaptive residual weights; enforce feasibility strictly.
Combine best-fit/worst-fit using item-size-dependent weights, smooth transitions, and bias for thresholds to avoid edge cases and balance space efficiency.
"Adaptive heuristics: Best Fit for large items (min slack), Worst Fit for small (max cap). Prioritize based on item size thresholds to optimize packing efficiency."
Combine heuristics (Best/Worst Fit), use dynamic weights influenced by item size, and penalize invalid bins.
Blend heuristics dynamically with item-sized weights, smooth thresholds, and epsilon adjustments for efficiency and gap robustness.
Combine best-fit/worst-fit heuristics with dynamic weights based on item size, prioritizing residual capacity preservation for smaller items and tight fits for larger ones.
