Adapt priority to item size: penalize large items' residuals, favor spacious bins for small items. Blend best-fit/worst-fit heuristics dynamically based on item size to balance space utilization.
Blend best-fit/worst-fit with adaptive weights (item-size-dependent thresholds), dynamic prioritization, and edge-case smoothing.
Prioritize bins minimizing leftover space, using negative scores for invalid fits.
Prioritize tight fits for large items, space preservation for small. Use dynamic formulas balancing both objectives with item size.
Adapt heuristics based on item size thresholds, combining Best/Worst Fit strategies to minimize slack for large items and preserve space for small ones.
Prioritize feasible bins by minimizing leftover space using inversions, tie-breakers, and lookahead for tighter packing.
Prioritize bins that fit the item with minimal leftover space, penalize unsuitable bins harshly.
Combine Best Fit (large) and Worst Fit (small) heuristics with dynamic priority scoring to optimize slack and space.
Prioritize feasible bins by minimal leftover space. Use -inf for invalid bins. Balance efficiency and tight packing.
"Combine Best Fit for large items and Worst Fit for small items using a dynamic priority function that balances slack minimization and space preservation."
