Use size thresholds to switch heuristics; prioritize Best Fit for large items (>0.5), Worst Fit for small. Simplify adaptive strategy selection. Avoid unnecessary non-linear penalties.
Use thresholds to switch strategies, simplify priority with deterministic rules, reduce non-linear terms, balance exploration-exploitation via adaptive weightings.
Prioritize bins with sufficient capacity, favoring minimal leftover space to reduce fragmentation. Tight fits improve efficiency.
Focus on minimal leftover space, prioritize feasible bins, simplify heuristics, leverage best fit strategy, ensure computational efficiency, avoid conflicting penalty terms.
Prefer simplicity to avoid overfitting; prioritize direct feasibility and minimal residual space like Best Fit's effective core heuristic.
Use size thresholds to switch strategies, favoring Best Fit for large items and Worst Fit for small. Prioritize simplicity and domain-specific intuition over complex adaptive blends.
Prioritize residual space with item-size-dependent weights, blend best/worst-fit heuristics around critical thresholds, and stabilize with small biases for smooth transitions and edge-case handling.
Focus on dynamic weight blending, smooth threshold transitions, and simplicity over complex penalties for effective heuristics.
Adaptive weights combining Best/Worst Fit based on item size; prioritize tight fits for large items, residual space for small items. Simplify penalty terms.
"Use remaining capacity to prioritize bins that minimize leftover space, exclude infeasible bins for better efficiency."
