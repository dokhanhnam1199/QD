Blend BF/WF with adaptive size thresholds, dynamic weights based on item features/bin state. Prioritize smooth transitions, minimize slack for large items, preserve gaps for small. Use epsilon tie-breaking, emphasize empirical validation over complexity. Simplify heuristics for robust, efficient packing. (49 words)
