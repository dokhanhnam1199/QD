Blend best-fit/worst-fit with item-size-dependent weights; penalize invalid bins. Prioritize residual capacity for large items, space preservation for small.
Blend heuristics using item characteristics to adaptively balance residual space optimization and feasibility, ensuring dynamic prioritization via weighted scoring.
Prioritize slack minimization for large items and remaining capacity maximization for small, adapting heuristics via size thresholds.
"Adapt priority formulas using item size to balance slack minimization (large items) and space preservation (small items) dynamically." (19 words)
Prioritize large items with Best Fit to minimize slack, use Worst Fit for small items to preserve larger spaces. Combine with adaptive scoring formulas balancing multiple factors like remaining capacity and item size.
Focus on tight fits, balance bin utilization, and adapt priority criteria for long-term efficiency.
"Prioritize minimal leftover space to reduce bins; balance efficiency with adaptive fitness for unpredictable item sizes."
Hybridize best/worst-fit heuristics; punish invalid bins; weight priority by item size; balance residual optimization dynamically.
Dynamic item-size weighting balances best/worst-fit heuristics. Penalize infeasible bins to minimize wasted space and reduce bin count.
Prioritize size-adaptive strategies: Best Fit for large items (min slack), Worst Fit for small (max remaining capacity). Differentiate priorities based on item characteristics to improve bin utilization.
