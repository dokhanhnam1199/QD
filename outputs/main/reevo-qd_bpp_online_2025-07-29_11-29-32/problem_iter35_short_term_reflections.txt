"Minimize leftover space, prioritize larger remaining capacity when tied, exclude unviable bins. Avoid flat priorities. Use secondary criteria via small epsilon." (19 words)
Combine size-dependent strategies, balance slack minimization with space preservation, use dynamic weights based on item dimensions, prioritize fit feasibility, and exploit problem structure for adaptive prioritization rules.
Use item size thresholds to combine Best Fit (large items) and weighted slack preservation (small items) with deterministic tie-breakers for optimal bin selection.
Prioritize item size thresholds, blending Best/Worst Fit. Use linear scoring for adaptive strategy selection.
"Prioritize bins with minimal leftover space, use item size and bin capacity in scoring, and ignore invalid bins. Leverage greedy strategies that optimize packing efficiency."
Prioritize dynamic item-size-dependent weights blending best/worst-fit, smooth transitions near thresholds, numerical stability via small biases, and residual-based scoring for efficient packing.
"Prioritize tight fits by minimizing leftover space, penalize invalid bins."
Prioritize item-specific strategies (e.g., Best Fit for large items, slack preservation for small ones) with deterministic tie-breakers to balance efficiency and exploration.
Adaptive priority combining best-fit for large items and worst-fit for small optimizes packing efficiency.
Adapt heuristics using dynamic item-size thresholds, combine best-fit/worst-fit, prioritize feasible bins, leverage efficient masking for performance.
