Prioritize simplicity; focus on core Best Fit (minimize residual space) instead of complex penalties.
Prioritize simplicity: blend Best/Worst Fit linearly with item size, use tie-breaking epsilons, and focus on residual space directly. Avoid complex penalties.
1. Combine heuristics adaptively using item size thresholds.  
2. Prioritize best-fit for large items, worst-fit for small.  
3. Ensure numerical stability with small epsilon adjustments.  
4. Balance residual capacity and item-size synergy.  
5. Smooth transitions prevent abrupt strategy shifts.
Blend BF/WF heuristics using item size thresholds. Prioritize slack minimization for large items, residual capacity for small ones. Smooth transitions enhance adaptability.
Use item-size thresholds (e.g., Best Fit for large items, Worst Fit for small) to minimize wasted space and reduce computational overhead.
"Adaptively blend Best/Worst Fit heuristics using item-size-dependent weights and epsilon tie-breaking to optimize bin usage efficiency." (20 words)
Use adaptive thresholds to switch between heuristics; balance slack minimization for large items and capacity preservation for small ones.
Prioritize simplicity: Reduce over-engineered penalties; align heuristics with core objectives like minimizing residual space or using Best Fit efficiently.
Prioritize simplicity: focus on residual space minimization, use clear tie-breakers, and avoid overcomplicating with adaptive weights or random perturbations that destabilize decisions.
Design heuristics with **linear adaptive weights based on item thresholds**, favoring Best Fit for large items and Worst Fit for small ones. Minimize unnecessary complexity like normalization and polynomial penalties, and directly blend criteria using item characteristics.
