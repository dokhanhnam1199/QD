"Integrate size-adaptive prioritization: best-fit (slack-minimal) for large items, space-preserving strategies (e.g., worst-fit) for small. Dynamically score bins using item/bin residual capacity ratios, penalizing overflows (–∞), prioritizing smallest remaining or maximal (item–residual). Balance tight-packing with future flexibility by avoiding thresholds, validating constraints." (49 words)
