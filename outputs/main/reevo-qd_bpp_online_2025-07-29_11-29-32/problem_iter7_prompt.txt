Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\n1. **Adaptive Weighting**: Blend best-fit (large items, minimize slack) and worst-fit (small items, preserve space) using item-size-dependent weights for dynamic balance.  \n2. **Penalize Infeasibility**: Score bins with negative infinity for overflows, prioritizing residual capacity alignment with item size to guide feasible, efficient allocations.  \n3. **Size-Driven Slack/Space Trade-off**: Prioritize slack minimization for large items (best-fit) and residual capacity maximization for small items (worst-fit) to optimize long-term bin efficiency.  \n4. **Threshold-Free Adaptation**: Continuously adjust priority formulas using item size and residual capacity ratios, avoiding rigid thresholds to maintain packing flexibility.  \n5. **Hybrid Strategy Reinforcement**: Combine heuristics with dynamic scoring that penalizes invalid fits, balancing space preservation (small items) and slack reduction (large items) to curtail bin count.  \n\nEach hint distills <50 words, integrating prior principles and new insights for actionable, size-aware heuristic design.\n\n[Code]\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority scores for bins based on Best Fit heuristic.\n\n    Bins that can fit the item are prioritized by smallest remaining capacity after placement.\n    Infeasible bins receive -inf priority.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    priority = np.where(can_fit, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)\n    return priority\n\n[Improved code]\nPlease write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection.
