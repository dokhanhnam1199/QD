Balance exploration/exploitation via adaptive weights, prioritize heuristics like best/worst fit, avoid overfitting with simpler terms.
Use Best Fit (minimize leftover space) with tie-breakers (e.g., larger remaining capacity) to prioritize feasible bins effectively.
Simplify strategies; focus on residual minimization. Avoid complex adaptive weights. Prioritize robustness. Normalize slack with item size. Remove unstable polynomial terms.
Focus on minimal residual space, use simple metrics like (item - capacity), avoid complex blending. Prioritize feasibility and direct space optimization.
Focus on minimizing residual deviation from a dynamic target, balance fit strategies via size-adaptive targets, use quadratic penalties for smooth optimization, prioritize simplicity.
Combine BF/WF heuristics with adaptive weights based on item size thresholds, prioritize slack minimization for large items, remaining capacity for small, smooth transitions.
Prioritize simplicity, leverage domain knowledge, use tie-breakers based on pre-placement capacity, and avoid overcomplicating penalty terms.
"Prioritize feasible bins with minimal leftover space using negative scores; assign -inf to invalid options."
Blend best-fit/worst-fit with item-size weights, adaptive thresholds, and numerical stability tweaks. Prioritize residual capacity and edge case handling.
"Focus on primary objectives (minimal leftover space) with simple tie-breakers. Avoid overcomplicating adaptive weights; use epsilon for stability." (19 words)
