1. **Adaptive Blending**: Use polynomial expressions to dynamically weigh Best/Worst Fit based on item size, balancing snug fits for large items and space preservation for small.  
2. **Feasibility-First Scoring**: Filter invalid bins first, then prioritize those minimizing residual deviation from ideal capacity via size-adjusted quadratic penalties.  
3. **Non-Linear Residual Tuning**: Combine item size and bin slack in scoring functions; penalize deviations from optimal residual targets to reduce fragmentation.  
4. **Epsilon-Stabilized Weights**: Avoid zeroing critical residual weights; add epsilon to ensure stability and smooth transitions in threshold-free adaptive strategies.  
5. **Math-Guided Thresholds**: Model item-capacity ratios to derive optimal blending parameters, replacing static rules with dynamic, math-optimized allocation logic.
