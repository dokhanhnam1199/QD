Blend best-fit (slack minimization for large items) and worst-fit (slack preservation for small items) using adaptive thresholds. Prioritize valid bins via vectorized operations (-inf penalty for invalid), empirically adjust thresholds to balance item-size synergy, edge robustness, and avoid non-linear complexity. Prefer tight fits, smooth transitions, and data-driven weight tuning. (49 words) 

*Constructive elements emphasized: threshold-driven strategy blending, efficient implementation, empirical validation, and balancing design tradeoffs.*
