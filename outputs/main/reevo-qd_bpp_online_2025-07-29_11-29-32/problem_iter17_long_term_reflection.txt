Use size thresholds (e.g., â‰¥0.5) to split strategies: Best Fit for large items (minimize slack), Worst Fit for small (maximize remaining space). Prioritize simple deterministic scoring, avoid adaptive penalties/blends, validate thresholds empirically for efficiency and clarity. Focus on residual minimization with direct space optimization.
