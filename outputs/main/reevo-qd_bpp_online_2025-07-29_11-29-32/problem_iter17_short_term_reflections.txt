"Focus on minimal residual scoring (Best Fit), avoid complex adaptive blends for clarity and efficiency." (18 words)
Use size thresholds for strategy switching (BF/WF), simplify priority scoring, avoid non-linear penalties, maintain computational efficiency, and ensure deterministic priority with clear feasibility handling.
Prioritize minimal leftover, use simple deterministic scoring, avoid complex penalties and normalizations.
Adaptively blend best-fit/worst-fit using item-dependent weights and residual capacity analysis. Prioritize feasibility with dynamic scoring.
Switch strategies based on item size thresholds: Best Fit for large items, Worst Fit for small ones. Simplify adaptive components; prioritize direct space optimization over complex penalties.Sharper decision boundaries often outperform gradual heuristics.
- Use item size thresholds to switch strategies (e.g., Best/Worst Fit for large/small items).
- Prioritize computational simplicity and numpy efficiency with clean masking.
- Avoid overcomplex polynomial blending; empirically validate threshold efficacy.
- Balance residual minimization and slack preservation based on item-bin ratio.
Simplify with size-dependent weights, smooth transitions between BF/WF, epsilon adjustment for edge cases, and minimal penalty terms. Prioritize item-size thresholds to determine strategy balance.
Adapt strategies based on item size: use Best Fit for large items (minimize slack) and Worst Fit for small ones (maximize remaining capacity).
Design simpler heuristics focusing on minimal residual space prioritization.
Prioritize fit quality by minimizing leftover space in bins to reduce overall waste.
