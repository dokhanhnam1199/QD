Prioritize minimal leftover space, use simple direct metrics (e.g., item - remaining capacity), avoid complex weight combinations.
Prioritize bins with minimal leftover space. Use negative priorities for invalid bins. Consider item size and bin capacity in scoring.
Adapt strategies based on item size: Best Fit for large items (tight fits), Worst Fit for small items (reserve space). Prioritize problem-specific patterns over generic combinations.
"Prioritize minimal leftover space (Best Fit), penalize invalid bins, and consider item size and bin utilization for improved heuristics."
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity (best-fit), avoid complex weighted combinations, focus on direct fit metrics.
Prioritize Best Fit for large items (minimize slack) and Worst Fit for small items. Check valid bins first. Threshold at 0.5.
Prioritize consistent Best Fit over hybrid heuristics; avoid arbitrary thresholds. Minimize leftover space universally for better bin utilization.
Prioritize bins with minimal slack (remaining capacity after placement) to reduce fragmentation. Avoid fixed thresholds; focus on dynamic, tight fits.
Prioritize feasible bins with smallest remaining capacity using negative scores for ascending priority.
Prioritize feasible bins using item-to-capacity ratios to favor tight packing, exclude invalid bins.
