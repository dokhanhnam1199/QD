Prioritize simplicity, adaptive item-size strategies, and problem structure exploitation (be best-fit large/worst-fit small); avoid overcomplication with stabilized, input-aware heuristics.
"Thresholds exploit size criticality: Best Fit for large (min slack), Worst Fit for small (preserve gaps). Balance adaptability and efficiency. Avoid fixed priorities."
Blend BF/WF heuristics with adaptive thresholds, prioritize smooth transitions, simplify components, avoid excessive penalty terms.
- Combine strategies (e.g., BF/WF) with adaptive weights for contextual balance.
- Use item features (size, weight) to dynamically adjust heuristic priorities.
- Smooth transitions between heuristics near critical thresholds improve stability.
- Prioritize minimizing slack for large items; maximize remaining capacity for small ones.
- Consider current bin state (density, variance) to refine placement decisions.
Focus on snug fits, ignore invalid bins, minimize leftover waste, balance bin fullness, and anticipate future item compatibility.
Adaptively blend best-fit (large)/worst-fit (small) via dynamic weights on residual capacity, penalizing invalid bins.
Prioritize item-specific thresholds; combine best/worst-fit heuristics balancing slack and capacity for efficient packing and future adaptability. Use situational strategies to optimize bin space dynamically.
1. Blend best/worst-fit heuristics with item-size weights.  
2. Smoothly transition policy weights at critical thresholds (e.g., item=0.5).  
3. Add small biases (epsilon) to prevent zero gradients or invalid weights.  
4. Prioritize residual capacity with dynamic, size-dependent scaling.  
5. Balance space efficiency and gap avoidance via adaptive heuristics.
Simplify priority functions; avoid overcomplicating with multiple penalties. Empirical validation outperforms theoretical complexity. Prioritize speed and generality over intricate mathematical models.
Prioritize adaptive item-based weights, balance residual penalties linearly, use minimal epsilon for tie-breaking, and avoid overcomplicating strategy blends.
