Blend heuristics with item-size weights, smooth transitions at thresholds, and biasing for edge-case robustness.
High-priority heuristics: adaptive thresholding, dual-strategy balance, item-bin size synergy, avoid non-linear terms.
Differentiate item sizes; use Best Fit for large items (min slack), Worst Fit variant for small items (slack preservation) with tie-breaker. Adjust thresholds and weights via data-driven analysis.
Focus on primary (leftover space) and secondary (existing capacity) priorities for effective bin selection.
Blend strategies dynamically using item size thresholds, prioritizing slack minimization for large items and space preservation for small ones with smooth transitions.
Prioritize tight fits, exclude unfit bins via -inf. Greedy minimal leftover heuristic enhances packing efficiency.
1. Adaptively switch strategies based on item size thresholds to balance fragmentation and space utilization.  
2. Combine best-fit (min residual) for large items with worst-fit (max residual) for small items.  
3. Prioritize valid bins using vectorized operations (e.g., NumPy masking) for efficiency.  
4. Use negative infinity for invalid bins to ensure exclusivity in greedy selection.  
5. Design threshold-based hybrid heuristics informed by item distribution patterns.
Use thresholds to switch strategies: Best Fit for large items (minimize waste), Worst Fit for small (preserve flexibility).
Prioritize adaptively combining heuristics (e.g., best-fit/worst-fit) based on item size thresholds, focusing on slack minimization/maximization to reduce wasted space while prioritizing bins with feasible fits.
Combine heuristics dynamically using item size thresholds, prioritize residual capacity adaptively, and penalize unfit bins.
