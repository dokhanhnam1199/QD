Blend Best Fit/Worst Fit using item thresholds (e.g., >0.5 → BF, ≤0.5 → WF). Prioritize minimal residual space with tie-breakers (e.g., remaining capacity). Mask invalid bins (-∞), penalize slack linearly/quad. Favor simplicity, validate thresholds empirically, and avoid adaptive overfitting. Leverage domain structure for robust, tight fits. (49 words)
