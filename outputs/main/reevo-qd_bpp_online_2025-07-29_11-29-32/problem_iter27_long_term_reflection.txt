Blend Best/Worst Fit using item thresholds (e.g., Best Fit for large >x, Worst Fit small â‰¤x). Prioritize residual space minimization for large items and capacity preservation for small. Use linear blending by size, tie-breaking epsilons, and smooth transitions. Favor simplicity over adaptive penalties; validate thresholds empirically for robustness. (46 words)
