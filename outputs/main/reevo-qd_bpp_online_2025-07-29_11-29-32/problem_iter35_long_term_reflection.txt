Blend Best/Worst Fit via adaptive thresholds balancing slack minimization (large items) and space preservation (small items). Prioritize fits minimizing leftover space, reject invalid bins. Resolve ties deterministically using residual capacity and epsilon-bias. Use dynamic weights, penalize infeasibility (-âˆž), and exploit residual space with squared-error scoring. (49 words)
