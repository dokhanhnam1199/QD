1. **Dynamic Best/Worst Blend**: Combine Best Fit (large items) and Worst Fit (small items) using adaptive weights proportional to item size, favoring tight fits or spacious bins dynamically—ensures slack reduction and long-term space efficiency.  

2. **Hard Penalization & Alignment**: Assign negative infinity to bins violating capacity constraints; prioritize feasible bins whose residual space aligns closely with the item’s size—guiding efficient, valid allocations without prior size thresholds.  

3. **Size-Driven Residual Scoring**: Prioritize bins minimizing leftover space for large items (slack aversion) but maximizing residual capacity for small items, using continuous scoring formulas adjusted by incoming item dimensions.  

4. **Threshold-Free Weighting**: Replace rigid size thresholds with smooth, ratio-based adaptation: weight Best/Worst Fit priorities by the item-to-bin residual ratio, maintaining strategy flexibility across varying packings.  

5. **Hybrid Lookahead Balancing**: Reinforce dynamic heuristics by penalizing invalid fits and biased space usage, blending slack minimization for large items with space preservation for small ones using lookahead tie-breakers for long-term optimality.
