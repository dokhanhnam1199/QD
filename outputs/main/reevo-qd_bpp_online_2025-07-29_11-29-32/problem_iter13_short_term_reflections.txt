1. Dynamically blend Best/Worst Fit by item size for adaptive bin selection.  
2. Prioritize bins balancing tight packing for large items and open space for small.  
3. Use non-linear equations combining item size and remaining capacity for priorities.  
4. Filter invalid bins first, then assign priority scores to feasible candidates.  
5. Optimize heuristic parameters via mathematical modeling of item-capacity interactions.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity matching item size, minimizing leftover space; avoid zero-based neutral priorities.
Combine best/worst-fit heuristics via item-size-dependent weights, use residual scoring, add epsilon to avoid zero weights, and ensure smooth threshold transitions for robust bin selection.
Combine Best/Worst Fit via item-size-adaptive prioritization using polynomial expressions to balance slack and space preservation in feasible bins.
Prioritize larger items with Best Fit and smaller with Worst Fit using item-size-aware dynamic scoring to balance slack and space.
Prioritize bins by minimizing leftover space; use item-to-capacity ratio dynamically for adaptive selection, avoiding static priorities.
1. Prioritize snug fits for large items, space preservation for small.  
2. Balance Best/Worst Fit via adaptive quadratic error penalties.  
3. Use item size to dynamically set optimal residual targets.  
4. Penalize bins deviating from ideal residual capacity.  
5. Feasible bins only; prefer minimal residual deviation.
Combine best-fit/worst-fit with adaptive item-size thresholds. Prioritize residual space to minimize fragmentation. Use vectorized operations for efficiency.
Prioritize bins minimizing leftover space using item-bin fit; focus on efficient capacity utilization.
Blend item-aware targets with adaptive strategies, prioritizing dynamic fit balance via penalized residuals.
