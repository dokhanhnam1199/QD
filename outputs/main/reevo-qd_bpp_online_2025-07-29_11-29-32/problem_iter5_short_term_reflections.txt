Combine size-adaptive strategies: prioritize slack minimization for large items and space preservation for small ones via dynamic priority functions.
Prioritize bins where (item - remaining capacity) is highest to minimize leftover space.
"Prioritize bins with smallest leftover space after item. Use dynamic capacity assessment."
Prioritize bins by combining size-specific strategies (e.g., tight packing for large items, space preservation for small), adapt dynamically based on item size and residual capacities.
"Prioritize feasible bins by minimal remaining capacity (best-fit), use -inf for invalid. Tight fit preference improves efficiency."
Use size-dependent prioritization: minimize slack for large items, preserve space for smalls with adaptive scoring functions.
"Prioritize feasible bins with minimal residual space; avoid overflow. Balance efficiency with future flexibility."
Prioritize feasible bins by post-placement gaps, validate constraints, and penalize infeasible options.
Prioritize bins that fit item *and* minimize remaining capacity via negative scores for tighter packing.
Prioritize bins that fit item with minimal remaining space via -inf penalty, exclude infeasible via -inf.
