Prioritize simplicity: use threshold-based blending of BF/WF, linear transitions, and minimal polynomial complexity for adaptive, stable heuristics.
Prioritize feasible bins with minimal leftover space, use -inf for invalid, exploit problem-specific structure.
Prioritize feasible bins with minimal post-placement waste; penalize infeasible bins.
Prioritize simplicity: Use proven heuristics like Best Fit (minimal residual space). Avoid overcomplicating with adaptive weights or theoretical penalties unless empirically beneficial. Focus on feasibility checks and direct efficiency.
Adaptive weights based on item size, blend Best/Worst Fit, use tie-breakers for residual capacity, mask invalid bins, and prioritize tighter fits via epsilon terms.
Adapt strategies based on item-to-bin size ratio and residual capacity to balance efficiency and fragmentation.
Blend BF/WF strategies with adaptive weights, use item size thresholds, prioritize slack minimization for large items, and remaining capacity for small items.
Use item and remaining capacity to penalize bins with excess space, prioritize minimal leftovers.
Prioritize feasible bins with minimal leftover space. Use negative values to rank closeness to item fit.
Prioritize simplicity: threshold-based strategy (Best Fit for >0.5, Worst Fit for â‰¤0.5). Avoid overcomplicated penalties. Leverage item size insights to balance fragmentation minimization and flexibility preservation.
