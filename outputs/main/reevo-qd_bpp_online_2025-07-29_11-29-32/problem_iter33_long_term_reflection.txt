- Blend Best/Worst Fit via adaptive size thresholds: optimize slack minimization for large items, flexibility for small.  
- Empirically tune thresholds to balance synergy, feasibility, and edge robustness.  
- Penalize invalid bins (-âˆž), prioritize residual space exploitation with squared error weighting.  
- Adaptively combine heuristics using dynamic, data-driven weights for real-time synergy.
