1. **Adaptive Weighting**: Blend best-fit (large items, minimize slack) and worst-fit (small items, preserve space) using item-size-dependent weights for dynamic balance.  
2. **Penalize Infeasibility**: Score bins with negative infinity for overflows, prioritizing residual capacity alignment with item size to guide feasible, efficient allocations.  
3. **Size-Driven Slack/Space Trade-off**: Prioritize slack minimization for large items (best-fit) and residual capacity maximization for small items (worst-fit) to optimize long-term bin efficiency.  
4. **Threshold-Free Adaptation**: Continuously adjust priority formulas using item size and residual capacity ratios, avoiding rigid thresholds to maintain packing flexibility.  
5. **Hybrid Strategy Reinforcement**: Combine heuristics with dynamic scoring that penalizes invalid fits, balancing space preservation (small items) and slack reduction (large items) to curtail bin count.  

Each hint distills <50 words, integrating prior principles and new insights for actionable, size-aware heuristic design.
