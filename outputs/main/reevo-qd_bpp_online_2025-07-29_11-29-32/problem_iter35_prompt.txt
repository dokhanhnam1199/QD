Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else.

BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n[Prior reflection]\nBlend Best/Worst Fit via adaptive thresholds balancing slack minimization (large items) and space preservation (small items). Prioritize fits minimizing leftover space, reject invalid bins. Resolve ties deterministically using residual capacity and epsilon-bias. Use dynamic weights, penalize infeasibility (-\u221e), and exploit residual space with squared-error scoring.
