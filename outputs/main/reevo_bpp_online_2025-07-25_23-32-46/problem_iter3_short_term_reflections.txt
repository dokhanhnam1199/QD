Normalize capacities, penalize unused bins, ensure non-negative scores, favor bins fitting the item.
Boost bins with second smallest gaps, penalize non-fit bins. Normalize priorities by item size.
Prioritize bins with larger gaps, penalize non-fit bins strongly, and boost second smallest gaps minimally for better Online BPP performance.
Prefer bins that fit items, penalize incapacity heavily; prioritize filling larger gaps slightly.
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, avoid negatives, and boost bins fitting item.
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, avoid negatives, and boost bins fitting item.
Boost bins with second smallest gaps, penalize non-fit bins. Normalize priorities by item size.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity, penalize gaps, focus on preventing unused bins, and penalize single small fragment bins.
Reduce complexity, penalize early bins, normalize capacities, penalize deviations, zero out non-fits.
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, avoid negatives, and boost bins fitting item.
