    This implementation focuses on a weighted strategy that considers normalized
    remaining capacities, penalizes unused bins, and penalizes bins where the item
    cannot fit. It balances fit and gap considerations without complex transformations.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
