Simplify priority logic, focus on gaps, penalize non-fit, boost second smallest gaps.
Use weighted strategies, normalize capacities, penalize unused bins, enhance fit scoring, and consider gaps effectively.
Normalize capacities, penalize gaps, boost fits, apply weighted penalties.
Normalize capacities, penalize gaps, boost fits, apply weighted penalties.
Use clear, weighted scoring for gaps and fits; penalize failures strictly.
Prioritize normalization, penalize non-fits, and boost ideal fits while reducing complexity and maintaining priority balance.
Adjust fit_boost normalization, handle edge cases, and prevent negative priority scores.
Focus normalization, penalize non-fits, boost fitting bins, consider order penalties, simplify logic for efficiency.
Simplify penalties, focus normalized capacities, prioritize fit boost, avoid unnecessary normalization steps.
Use normalized total capacity, weighted gap and fit factors, and emphasize bins with larger gaps.
