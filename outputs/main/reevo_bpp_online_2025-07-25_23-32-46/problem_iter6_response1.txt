    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation normalizes the remaining capacities, penalizes unused bins,
    boosts bins where the item fits well, considers gaps for good fits,
    and normalizes by item size. It also penalizes bins where the item cannot fit.
    Additionally, it uses a weighted strategy and considers order penalties.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
