Penalize unused bins, normalize scores, and enhance fit checks for balanced bin selection.
Normalize by total capacity, adjust penalties, and weight boosts more evenly.
Focus on total capacity normalization, simplify unused bin penalty calculation, eliminate redundant score adjustments.
Focus on boosting fits and penalizing gaps, normalize capacities, handle non-fits with -âˆž penalty, apply weighted strategy.
Refine fit and gap calculations, balance penalties, ensure non-fit exclusion, normalize scores, and leverage exponential penalties for emptier bins.
Penalize unused bins, boost fit gaps, weight gaps heavier, normalize scores, prevent negatives.
Balance penalties, normalize capacities, use exponential decay, prioritize gaps.
Normalize capacities, penalize unused bins, boost good fits, use weighted gaps, and ensure balanced priorities.
Normalize by total capacity, adjust penalties, and weight boosts more evenly.
Normalize capacities, penalize unused bins, boost good fits, use weighted gaps, and ensure balanced priorities.
