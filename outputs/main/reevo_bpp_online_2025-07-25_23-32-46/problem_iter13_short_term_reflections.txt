Use exponential decay for unused bins, adjust weights, normalize by item size, and ensure non-negative scores.
Enhance normalization, handle edge cases, refine penalties, and avoid negative scores for robust online BPP heuristics.
Focus on normalization, penalize unused bins, boost based on gap, simplify logic, ensure non-negative scores.
Simplify logic, focus weights, normalize scores, prioritize fits clearly, penalize non-fits sharply.
Focus on fit boosts, penalize gaps, normalize, and use weighted scores for balanced priority.
Prioritize bins with better fits, penalize gaps, normalize thoroughly, and ensure non-negative scores always.
Enhance penalties, normalize by item size, use weights for different criteria, and penalize gaps properly.
Prioritize gaps, normalize by item size, penalize unused bins effectively, and balance with fit ratios.
Use exponential decay for unused bins, adjust weights, normalize by item size, and ensure non-negative scores.
Prioritize bins with smaller gaps, normalize penalties, balance weights effectively, and avoid excessive normalizations.
