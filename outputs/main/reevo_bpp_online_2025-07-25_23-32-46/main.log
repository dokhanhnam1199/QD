System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)

Refer to the format of a trivial design above. Be very creative and give `priority_v2`. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Use a max function to avoid negative priorities if item is larger than remaining capacity
    base_priority = np.maximum(bins_remain_cap - item, 0)

    # Penalize bins that do not have enough remaining capacity to fit the item
    penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item), 0)

    # Integrated priority calculation
    priority = base_priority + penalty

    return priority

[Better code]

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used penalties to encourage efficient packing while distributing load.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate normalized remaining capacity
    remain_cap_normalized = bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)
    
    # Penalize for each unused bin to encourage filling existing bins
    num_bins_penalty = np.nan_to_num(1 / (np.count_nonzero(bins_remain_cap) + 1e-6), posinf=0)
    
    # Avoid negative priority scores (e.g., if item is larger than a bin)
    priority_scores = (remain_cap_normalized - item) + num_bins_penalty
    priority_scores[priority_scores < 0] = 0
    
    # Encourage using bins with large enough space for the item
    priority_scores[bins_remain_cap >= item] += 1
    
    return priority_scores

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Worse code]
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used using a weighted score. Bins that are closer to being full get higher
    priority, but the priority is slightly reduced for bins that have less remaining
    capacity than the item to prevent unused bin scenarios.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Linear decreasing priority based on remaining capacity
    # Use a max function to avoid negative priorities if item is larger than remaining capacity
    base_priority = np.maximum(bins_remain_cap - item, 0)

    # Penalize bins that do not have enough remaining capacity to fit the item
    penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item), 0)

    # Integrated priority calculation
    priority = base_priority + penalty

    return priority

[Better code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used penalties to encourage efficient packing while distributing load.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate normalized remaining capacity
    remain_cap_normalized = bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)
    
    # Penalize for each unused bin to encourage filling existing bins
    num_bins_penalty = np.nan_to_num(1 / (np.count_nonzero(bins_remain_cap) + 1e-6), posinf=0)
    
    # Avoid negative priority scores (e.g., if item is larger than a bin)
    priority_scores = (remain_cap_normalized - item) + num_bins_penalty
    priority_scores[priority_scores < 0] = 0
    
    # Encourage using bins with large enough space for the item
    priority_scores[bins_remain_cap >= item] += 1
    
    return priority_scores

[Reflection]
Normalize capacities, penalize unused bins, ensure non-negative scores, favor bins fitting the item.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Normalize capacities, penalize unused bins, ensure non-negative scores, favor bins fitting the item.
Boost bins with second smallest gaps, penalize non-fit bins. Normalize priorities by item size.
Prioritize bins with larger gaps, penalize non-fit bins strongly, and boost second smallest gaps minimally for better Online BPP performance.
Prefer bins that fit items, penalize incapacity heavily; prioritize filling larger gaps slightly.
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, avoid negatives, and boost bins fitting item.
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, avoid negatives, and boost bins fitting item.
Boost bins with second smallest gaps, penalize non-fit bins. Normalize priorities by item size.
Prioritize bins with higher remaining capacity, penalize gaps, focus on preventing unused bins, and penalize single small fragment bins.
Reduce complexity, penalize early bins, normalize capacities, penalize deviations, zero out non-fits.
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, avoid negatives, and boost bins fitting item.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
Focus on normalized capacities, penalize unused bins, and boost item-fitting bins. Prioritize large gaps and penalize non-fits, normalize priorities by item size, reducing complexity and penalizing early deviations.

[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation considers both the remaining capacity and the number of
    bins used penalties to encourage efficient packing while distributing load.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate normalized remaining capacity
    remain_cap_normalized = bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap)
    
    # Penalize for number of bins used (smaller the index, the more penalty)
    order_penalties = np.exp(-np.arange(len(bins_remain_cap)))
    
    # Calculate available capacity after placing the item
    available_cap_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Assign zero priority to bins where the item cannot fit
    np.place(available_cap_after, available_cap_after < 0, 0)
    
    # Higher scores for higher available capacity and negative penalty
    priority_scores = remain_cap_normalized * order_penalties
    
    # Penalize binschema적으로 pero inversely with how much remains if the item is too large to fit perfectly
    deviation_from_perfect_fit = np.abs(available_cap_after / bins_remain_cap)
    priority_scores -= (bins_remain_cap == 0) * deviation_from_perfect_fit
    
    return priority_scores

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation focuses on a weighted strategy that considers normalized
    remaining capacities, penalizes unused bins, penalizes bins where the item
    cannot fit, and boosts bins where the item fits well with consideration of gaps.
    It also ensures a balance by normalizing scores by the item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
