def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This implementation focuses on normalized remaining capacity, penalizes unused bins,
    and boosts bins where the item fits well, considering gaps and penalizing non-fits.
    It normalizes priorities by item size and reduces complexity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
