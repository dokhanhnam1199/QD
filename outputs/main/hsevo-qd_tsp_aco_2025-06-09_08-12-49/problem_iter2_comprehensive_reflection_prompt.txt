{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize meaningful features and combine them thoughtfully. Consider physical analogies (like Newtonian mechanics) to create richer heuristics. Normalizing the heuristic values can improve stability. Critically, ensure thorough testing and evaluation to differentiate performance between heuristics. Avoid redundant code.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
