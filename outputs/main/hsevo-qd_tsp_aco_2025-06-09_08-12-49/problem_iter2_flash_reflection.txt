**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic uses a Newtonian approach, considering gravitational attraction and potential energy, along with normalization, while the last one simply returns the inverse of the distance matrix.
(2nd) vs (19th) - Same as above. The second heuristic is identical to the first, and the 19th is the simple inverse distance heuristic.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. The Newtonian heuristic is repeated multiple times.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see they are identical to the 1st and 2nd.
Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical, all just returning the inverse of the distance matrix.
Overall: The top 10 heuristics are identical, implementing a Newtonian-inspired approach. The bottom 10 heuristics are also identical, using a simple inverse distance calculation. The difference in ranking stems from the more sophisticated approach of the Newtonian heuristic compared to the basic inverse distance method. The repeated code suggests a failure in properly evaluating and differentiating heuristic performance.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, prioritize meaningful features and combine them thoughtfully. Consider physical analogies (like Newtonian mechanics) to create richer heuristics. Normalizing the heuristic values can improve stability. Critically, ensure thorough testing and evaluation to differentiate performance between heuristics. Avoid redundant code.
