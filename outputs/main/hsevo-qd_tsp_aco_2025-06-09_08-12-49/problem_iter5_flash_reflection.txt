**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines Newtonian attraction and inverse distance, normalizes the result, and includes a small epsilon to avoid division by zero. The worst simply returns the inverse of the distance matrix, lacking any sophisticated combination or normalization.
Comparing (14th) vs (17th), the 14th heuristic adds node degree consideration and sparsification to the Newtonian attraction and inverse distance components, while the 17th heuristic is the same as the 20th.
Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the first uses tuned parameters while the 6th hardcodes weights.
Comparing (14th) vs (6th), the 14th incorporates degree and sparsification.
Overall: The better heuristics consider multiple factors beyond just inverse distance, normalize results for stability, avoid division by zero, may incorporate sparsification, and may tune parameters. Simpler heuristics perform worse. Also docstrings affect.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors, normalizing outputs, handling edge cases like division by zero, and tuning parameters for optimal performance. Sparsification can also improve performance. Comprehensive docstrings are also important.
