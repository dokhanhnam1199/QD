- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable steps and avoiding common pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Feature Engineering, Normalization, Edge-Case Handling, Parameter Tuning, Sparsification, Physical Analogy, Empirical Validation, Code Efficiency.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize *meaningful* feature combinations informed by domain knowledge or physical principles. Rigorously test and compare heuristic performance with statistical significance.

*   **Avoid:** Redundant calculations, neglecting edge cases (e.g., division by zero), and premature optimization without proper validation.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics stem from insightful feature engineering, robust handling of numerical issues, and iterative refinement guided by empirical data.
