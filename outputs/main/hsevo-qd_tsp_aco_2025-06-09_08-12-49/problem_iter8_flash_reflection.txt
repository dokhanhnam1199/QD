**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (19th), we see that the best heuristic combines Newtonian attraction, inverse distance, and carefully tuned weights, along with normalization and sparsification, while the worst simply returns the inverse of the distance matrix. Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), we again observe the inclusion of Newtonian attraction, inverse distance, and node degree, as well as sparsification and normalization, contrasting with the simple inverse distance approach. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first one uses carefully tuned weights as parameters, and the second one uses hardcoded weights and includes a node degree component. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), no difference. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors beyond just distance, such as node degree and a Newtonian attraction analogy, and use parameter tuning. Sparsification, normalization, and an epsilon value for numerical stability are also common features. Parameter tuning is the most important design for good heuristics.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and tuning their weights. Normalization and sparsification can improve performance. Always include a small epsilon to prevent division by zero. Parameterize your code instead of hardcoding it.
