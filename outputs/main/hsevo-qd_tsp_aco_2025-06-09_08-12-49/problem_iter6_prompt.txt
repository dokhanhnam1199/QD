Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following \"heuristics\". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines Newtonian attraction with inverse distance for TSP edge prioritization.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristics = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n    safe_distance_matrix = distance_matrix + epsilon\n\n    # Newtonian attraction component\n    attraction = 1 / (safe_distance_matrix**2)\n    mass = np.sum(1 / safe_distance_matrix, axis=1)\n    M = np.outer(mass, mass)\n    potential_energy = safe_distance_matrix / np.mean(safe_distance_matrix)\n    newtonian = (attraction * M) / potential_energy\n\n    # Inverse distance component\n    inverse_distance = 1 / safe_distance_matrix\n\n    # Combine the two components\n    heuristics = attraction_weight * newtonian + inverse_distance_weight * inverse_distance\n\n    # Normalize\n    min_heuristic = np.min(heuristics)\n    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristics)\n    heuristics = (heuristics - min_heuristic) / (max_heuristic - min_heuristic)\n\n    return heuristics\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `heuristics_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable steps and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Feature Engineering, Normalization, Edge-Case Handling, Parameter Tuning, Sparsification, Physical Analogy, Empirical Validation, Code Efficiency.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize *meaningful* feature combinations informed by domain knowledge or physical principles. Rigorously test and compare heuristic performance with statistical significance.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Redundant calculations, neglecting edge cases (e.g., division by zero), and premature optimization without proper validation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics stem from insightful feature engineering, robust handling of numerical issues, and iterative refinement guided by empirical data.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
