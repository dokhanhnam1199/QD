- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, I'm ready to refine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design. Let's focus on actionable improvements, not just general reminders.

*   **Keywords:** Feature Engineering, Analogy, Evaluation Rigor, Code Clarity
*   **Advice:** Emphasize creating novel features through insightful combinations (especially physical analogies). Design robust testing procedures to truly compare heuristic effectiveness.
*   **Avoid:** Vague statements like "consider combining factors." Instead, focus on *how* to combine them creatively and meaningfully.
*   **Explanation:** Move beyond general principles. We need concrete techniques for feature creation, rigorous evaluation, and maintainable code, not just the awareness of their importance.
