Your task is to write a heuristics function for Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following \"heuristics\". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.\nThe `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix, and returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef heuristics_v1(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines Newtonian attraction with inverse distance for TSP edge prioritization.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = distance_matrix.shape[0]\n    heuristics = np.zeros_like(distance_matrix)\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n    safe_distance_matrix = distance_matrix + epsilon\n\n    # Newtonian attraction component\n    attraction = 1 / (safe_distance_matrix**2)\n    mass = np.sum(1 / safe_distance_matrix, axis=1)\n    M = np.outer(mass, mass)\n    potential_energy = safe_distance_matrix / np.mean(safe_distance_matrix)\n    newtonian = (attraction * M) / potential_energy\n\n    # Inverse distance component\n    inverse_distance = 1 / safe_distance_matrix\n\n    # Combine the two components\n    heuristics = 0.7 * newtonian + 0.3 * inverse_distance\n\n    # Normalize\n    min_heuristic = np.min(heuristics)\n    max_heuristic = np.max(heuristics)\n    heuristics = (heuristics - min_heuristic) / (max_heuristic - min_heuristic)\n\n    return heuristics\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `heuristics_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics. We'll focus on actionability and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Feature Engineering, Analogical Thinking, Normalization, Empirical Validation, Code Efficiency, Adaptive Learning.\n*   **Advice:** Rigorously analyze problem structure, leverage domain knowledge for feature selection, draw inspiration from diverse fields, and adapt heuristic parameters based on performance feedback.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting edge cases, and insufficient performance benchmarking.\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritize deep problem understanding, informed feature creation, adaptable strategies, and robust validation for superior heuristic design.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
