- Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.
- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.
Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more effective for designing better heuristics. We'll focus on actionability and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Feature Engineering, Analogical Thinking, Normalization, Empirical Validation, Code Efficiency, Adaptive Learning.
*   **Advice:** Rigorously analyze problem structure, leverage domain knowledge for feature selection, draw inspiration from diverse fields, and adapt heuristic parameters based on performance feedback.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, relying solely on intuition, neglecting edge cases, and insufficient performance benchmarking.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize deep problem understanding, informed feature creation, adaptable strategies, and robust validation for superior heuristic design.
