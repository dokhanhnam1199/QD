Comparing (2nd best) vs (2nd worst), we again observe the inclusion of Newtonian attraction, inverse distance, and node degree, as well as sparsification and normalization, contrasting with the simple inverse distance approach. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first one uses carefully tuned weights as parameters, and the second one uses hardcoded weights and includes a node degree component. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), no difference. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), no difference. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors beyond just distance, such as node degree and a Newtonian attraction analogy, and use parameter tuning. Sparsification, normalization, and an epsilon value for numerical stability are also common features. Parameter tuning is the most important design for good heuristics.\n- - Try combining various factors to determine how promising it is to select an edge.\n- Try sparsifying the matrix by setting unpromising elements to zero.\nOkay, I'm ready to refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for better heuristic design. Let's focus on actionable improvements, not just general reminders.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Feature Engineering, Analogy, Evaluation Rigor, Code Clarity\n*   **Advice:** Emphasize creating novel features through insightful combinations (especially physical analogies). Design robust testing procedures to truly compare heuristic effectiveness.\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements like \"consider combining factors.\" Instead, focus on *how* to combine them creatively and meaningfully.\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond general principles. We need concrete techniques for feature creation, rigorous evaluation, and maintainable code, not just the awareness of their importance.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `heuristics_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
