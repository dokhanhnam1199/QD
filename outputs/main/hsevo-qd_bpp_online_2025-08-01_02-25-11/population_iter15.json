It seeks to\n    assign an item to a bin such that the bin's remaining capacity after placement\n    is close to a predefined 'ideal' target value. This approach is more adaptive\n    and holistic than a simple Best Fit, as it manages the distribution of\n    remaining bin capacities, potentially leaving more \"useful\" space for\n    future items and promoting a more diverse set of bin states.\n\n    The 'ideal_remainder_ratio' parameter determines the target remaining capacity\n    as a fraction of the total bin capacity. A value of 0.0 would revert to a\n    pure Best Fit (minimizing remaining capacity). A value closer to 1.0 would\n    lean towards Worst Fit (maximizing remaining capacity). A moderate value\n    (e.g., 0.25) attempts to maintain a balanced bin state.\n\n    Assumptions:\n    1. The problem implies a fixed `BIN_CAPACITY` for all bins.

Therefore, `np.max(bins_remain_cap)`\n       is used as a reasonable proxy for `BIN_CAPACITY`, assuming at least one\n       bin is either empty (full capacity) or has the largest possible remaining capacity.\n       For extreme edge cases (e.g., all bins are almost full and no new empty bin has been opened yet),\n       this inference might be inaccurate, but it's a common practical approach.\n    2. `item` and `bins_remain_cap` values are in consistent units.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of current remaining capacities for each bin.\n\n    Returns:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n        Higher scores indicate higher priority.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n\n    # Handle case where no bins are available or bins_remain_cap is empty\n    if bins_remain_cap.size == 0:\n        return priorities\n\n    # Infer BIN_CAPACITY from the maximum remaining capacity among current bins.\n    # This assumes that at least one \"fresh\" bin (with full capacity) is or was available,\n    # or that the maximum value represents the standard bin capacity.\n    BIN_CAPACITY = np.max(bins_remain_cap)\n    if BIN_CAPACITY == 0: # Avoid division by zero if all bins are exactly 0 capacity\n        return priorities # No item can fit anywhere\n\n    # Define the ideal remaining capacity ratio after placing an item.\n    # This is a key heuristic parameter for tuning:\n    # 0.0 for Best Fit, ~0.2-0.3 for a more balanced \"middle-fit\".\n    ideal_remainder_ratio = 0.25\n    TARGET_REMAINDER = BIN_CAPACITY * ideal_remainder_ratio\n\n    # Find bins where the item can fit\n    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    # Calculate the remaining capacity if the item were placed in fitting bins\n    potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item\n\n    # Calculate priority based on the absolute difference from the TARGET_REMAINDER.\n    # We want to minimize this absolute difference, so we take its negative.\n    # This means bins whose `potential_remaining_cap` is closest to `TARGET_REMAINDER`\n    # will receive the highest priority.\n    priorities[can_fit_mask] = -np.abs(potential_remaining_cap - TARGET_REMAINDER)\n\n    return priorities",
