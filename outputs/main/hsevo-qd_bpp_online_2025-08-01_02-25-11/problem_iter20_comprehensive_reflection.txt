*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Non-linear, Hybrid, State-aware, Quality-of-space.
*   **Advice:** Design hybrid heuristics with adaptive, non-linear rules targeting critical bin states (completion, fragmentation). Use functions like exponential/Gaussian/logarithmic for specific incentives. Prioritize remaining space *quality* via tunable parameters.
*   **Avoid:** Sole reliance on monotonic/linear relationships, simple additive bonuses, or shying away from non-linear complexity. Do not over-emphasize basic greedy without state awareness of bin characteristics.
*   **Explanation:** Non-linear, state-aware functions capture nuanced problem dynamics, providing precise incentives/penalties (e.g., sharp fragmentation costs, strong completion bonuses) that linear or overly simplistic approaches miss, yielding superior solutions.
