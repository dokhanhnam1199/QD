{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nFor bin packing, \"Best Fit\" is a robust baseline. Enhancing it with a slight preference for existing, partially filled bins over opening new ones significantly improves performance by promoting consolidation. Avoid arbitrary or equal-priority choices, as intelligent bin selection (minimizing waste) is key to better solutions.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics:\n1.  Prioritize clear, monotonic relationships between desired outcomes (e.g., minimal remaining space) and priority scores.\n2.  Explicitly handle infeasible options (e.g., bins that can't fit an item) by assigning them extremely low (negative infinity) priority.\n3.  Be cautious with non-linear mathematical transformations or numerical \"tricks\" like `epsilon`; simpler linear approaches are often more robust and perform better.\n4.  Any intelligent greedy strategy, even a basic one like \"Best Fit,\" is significantly better than a null or random selection.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
