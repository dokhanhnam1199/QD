**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (4th), we see a significant jump in heuristic sophistication. The top-ranked (1st) introduces an "aggressively incentivized" exponential exact-fit bonus (magnitude 5000.0, decay 50.0), a "Valley of Despair" fragmentation penalty shaped like a negative Gaussian curve (peaking at 40% of item size), and a "Quality of Large Remaining Space Bonus" (logarithmic). In contrast, (4th) uses a discrete exact fit bonus (1000.0) and a simpler linear fragmentation penalty (proportional to normalized remainder, up to item size). The non-linear, adaptive components in (1st) provide far more nuanced control over bin states, encouraging aggressive bin closure and intelligent space management beyond simple minimization.

Comparing (4th) vs (8th), the fragmentation penalty shifts from a linearly scaled penalty based on `normalized_fragment_rem` (in 4th) to a fixed `TINY_REMAINDER_PENALTY` applied if the remainder is below `TINY_REMAINDER_THRESHOLD` (in 8th). The exact fit bonus is discrete and high in both (1000.0). The explicit threshold-based penalty in (8th) is simpler but less adaptive than the item-size-normalized linear penalty in (4th), which is itself less sophisticated than the Gaussian penalty in (1st). The higher performance of (4th) suggests its fragmentation handling, though linear, is more effective than a simple "tiny remainder" threshold.

Comparing (8th) vs (9th), (8th) employs a "Hybrid Fit" with a "Perfect/Near-Perfect Fit Bonus" and a "Tiny Remainder Penalty", while (9th) is a pure "Best Fit" strategy, prioritizing only the smallest remaining capacity. The clear improvement from (9th) to (8th) highlights the critical importance of explicitly incentivizing bin completion and penalizing awkward fragment creation.

Comparing (9th) vs (13th), both start with a "Best Fit" core. (13th) adds a small `used_bin_bonus` (1e-6) to prefer existing, partially filled bins over new ones. This subtle consolidation preference in (13th) leads to better performance than plain Best Fit (9th), indicating that even a minor bias towards existing bins can be beneficial for reducing the total bin count.

Comparing (13th) vs (14th), both aim for "Best Fit" plus a "Consolidation Bonus". (13th) explicitly takes `bin_capacity` as an argument and uses a very small `used_bin_bonus` of 1e-6. (14th) infers `BIN_CAPACITY` from `np.max(bins_remain_cap)` and uses a larger `CONSOLIDATION_BONUS` of 0.01. The stronger consolidation bias and adaptive `BIN_CAPACITY` inference in (14th) likely contribute to its better performance.

Comparing (14th) vs (20th), (14th) utilizes Best Fit plus a consolidation bonus, whereas (20th) implements a "Target Remainder Fit", aiming to leave a specific `ideal_remainder_ratio` (hardcoded 0.25) of the bin capacity. The higher ranking of (14th) suggests that a combination of Best Fit and consolidation is generally more robust and effective than solely targeting an ideal remainder, which might lead to suboptimal packing if the chosen target isn't universally beneficial across different item sizes.

Comparing (20th) vs (16th), (20th) attempts a "Target Remainder Fit" by minimizing the absolute difference from a target remaining capacity. In stark contrast, (16th) simply returns `np.zeros_like`, assigning equal priority to all fitting bins, which is equivalent to an arbitrary selection (e.g., First Fit). The functional strategy in (20th), despite its specific approach, vastly outperforms the null strategy of (16th).

Comparing (1st/2nd/3rd) with each other, they are identical code snippets. The same applies to (4th/5th/6th), (7th/10th), (8th/11th), (9th/12th), (14th/15th), (16th/17th), and (18th/19th). This suggests that the ranking differences within these identical groups are negligible or due to external factors not present in the code.

Overall: The best heuristics employ a multi-faceted approach, balancing immediate best fit with future bin state management. This includes strong incentives for bin completion, nuanced penalties for fragmentation, and strategies for maintaining useful large spaces. Non-linear, adaptive functions are crucial for expressing these complex preferences. Simple Best Fit is a good baseline, but more sophisticated additions consistently improve performance. Purely arbitrary choices are the worst.

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics combine multiple objectives using non-linear functions (exponential for sharp incentives, Gaussian for targeted penalties, logarithmic for diminishing returns). Adaptiveness (e.g., scaling with item size) is key. Bin completion and fragmentation avoidance are paramount. Tunable parameters allow fine-grained control and performance optimization.
