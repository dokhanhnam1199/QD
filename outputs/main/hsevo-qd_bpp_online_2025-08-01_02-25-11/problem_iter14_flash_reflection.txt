**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (11th-15th), we observe that the best heuristic (1st) leverages a refined "Best Fit" strategy by adding a small, fixed bonus for partially filled bins, aiming to consolidate items and delay opening new bins. In stark contrast, the worst heuristics (11th-15th) return `np.zeros_like`, effectively making a random choice among bins that can fit an item, demonstrating a complete lack of intelligent prioritization.

Comparing (2nd/10th) vs (16th-20th), the second-best heuristics (2nd/10th) implement a pure "Best Fit" strategy, prioritizing the tightest possible fit to minimize remaining bin capacity. This simple, effective approach often leads to good packing density. The second-worst heuristics (16th-20th), "Target Remainder Fit," aim to leave a predefined target amount of space in bins. While conceptually advanced, this strategy often performs worse than Best Fit for minimizing bin count because it prioritizes leaving "useful" space over tight packing, which can lead to more bins being used or less optimal utilization overall.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd/10th), the primary difference is the `used_bin_bonus` in 1st. While 2nd/10th strictly minimize remaining capacity, 1st introduces a tiny preference for existing, partially filled bins. This subtle bias in 1st encourages consolidation, which can lead to fewer total bins compared to pure Best Fit by slightly prioritizing filling an already-opened bin over opening a new one that might offer an almost identical (but infinitesimally better) fit. This minor, well-controlled perturbation seems to yield better results.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), 4th is functionally identical to 1st (Best Fit with a small consolidation bonus) and is ranked much higher than 3rd. Heuristic 3rd attempts a "Hybrid Fit" with large, hard-coded bonuses for perfect fits and penalties for "tiny remainders." This indicates that overly complex heuristics with aggressive, fixed magnitude parameters can perform worse than simpler, more robust Best Fit variants. The large parameter values in 3rd (`PERFECT_FIT_BONUS=1000.0`, `TINY_REMAINDER_PENALTY=500.0`) can drastically distort the priority landscape, leading to non-optimal decisions without careful, instance-specific tuning.

Comparing (second worst: 16th-20th) vs (worst: 11th-15th), the "Target Remainder Fit" heuristics (16th-20th) at least attempt a coherent (though often suboptimal for bin minimization) strategy. They involve calculations based on potential remaining capacity and a target. In contrast, the `np.zeros_like` heuristics (11th-15th) provide no decision-making logic, leading to random or arbitrary bin assignments, which is demonstrably the least effective approach for an optimization problem. The Target Remainder Fit, while performing poorly here, is still a structured heuristic, unlike the "no-op" of returning zeros.

**Experience:**
Simplicity and robustness are key; a well-tuned Best Fit is a strong baseline. Small, controlled biases (e.g., consolidation bonuses) are often effective refinements. Overly complex heuristics or those with untuned, large-magnitude parameters can perform worse than simpler ones, as their intended benefits might be outweighed by unintended side effects or parameter sensitivity.
