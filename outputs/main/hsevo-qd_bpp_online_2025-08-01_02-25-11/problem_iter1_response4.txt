    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,
    guided by the principle of "Optimal Flux" or "Resonance Fit," reminiscent of my
    work in efficient energy transmission. My aim is to utilize the available
    'conduit' (bin) capacity with utmost precision, minimizing the 'waste' or
    'unfilled potential' within each container.

    A bin that perfectly accommodates an item, or leaves the smallest possible void,
    is highly prized. This ensures a balanced and efficient distribution of 'load'
    across our system, preventing a buildup of inefficiencies.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Higher scores indicate a more desirable bin.

    # Our 'Optimal Flux' heuristic dictates that the most desirable bin is one that leaves
    # the smallest 'residual potential'. We achieve this by assigning a higher priority
    # to bins where (remaining_capacity_after_fit + epsilon) is smaller.
    # The reciprocal function naturally amplifies smaller values, creating a strong 'gravitational pull'
    # towards the best fitting bin.
