*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by integrating robust baselines with **adaptive, non-linear rules** that intelligently respond to critical bin states (e.g., exact fits, problematic fragmentation). Strongly incentivize bin completion and focus on the *quality* of remaining space.
*   **Avoid:** Limiting design to solely monotonic relationships or simple linear bonuses. Do not avoid non-linear transformations or dynamic weighting; embrace them to handle specific state-based challenges. Avoid static, hard-coded "negative infinity" penalties.
*   **Explanation:** Superior heuristic performance arises from dynamic adaptation to problem states. Non-linear, state-dependent rules can capture complex interactions and objectives (like space quality or bin closure) that are missed by overly simplistic or rigidly linear approaches.
