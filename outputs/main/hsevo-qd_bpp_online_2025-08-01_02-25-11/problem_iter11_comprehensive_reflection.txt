Here's a redefinition of 'Current self-reflection' for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Holistic, Robustness, Exploration
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to problem characteristics. Focus on leveraging deep domain insights to guide search, promoting diverse solution exploration beyond immediate greedy choices. Prioritize robustness and generalizability across varied instances.
*   **Avoid:** Relying solely on static, fixed-rule scoring or simple consolidation bonuses. Avoid discussions of specific "Best Fit" enhancements, monotonic priorities, or numerical "tricks." Do not base design solely on local optimality without considering broader solution space.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics transcend rigid rules by understanding problem dynamics and exploring a wider solution landscape, leading to more resilient and adaptable performance.
