Here's a redefined self-reflection for designing better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Transparency, Robustness, Simplicity, Iteration.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize designs with clear, monotonic objective function relationships. Explicitly handle all feasibility constraints. Favor simpler linear logic over complex non-linearities unless thoroughly validated. Systematically build from robust baselines.
*   **Avoid:** Obscure, non-interpretable logic; implicit or ignored constraint handling; arbitrary "magic numbers" or unverified transformations; and trying to leapfrog foundational improvements.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection focuses on creating transparent, robust, and incrementally improvable heuristics by valuing clarity and systematic development over unproven complexity.
