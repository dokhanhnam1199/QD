Here's a redefinition of self-reflection, focusing on principles for better heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Priorities, Non-linear Functions, Exploration, Multi-objective.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize dynamic, non-linear scoring systems that adapt to solution progression. Integrate controlled exploration, even if it means temporary non-greedy choices. Embrace complex numerical transformations and intricate parameter tuning. Consider multi-objective optimization beyond immediate "waste" minimization.
*   **Avoid:** Static or strictly monotonic priority relationships. Sole reliance on simple greedy strategies. Ignoring the potential of non-linear "tricks" or complex interactions. A singular, myopic objective like minimal remaining space.
*   **Explanation:** Sophisticated, adaptive decision models, coupled with strategic exploration and nuanced objective functions, can reveal richer solution landscapes and overcome limitations of simpler, fixed heuristics.
