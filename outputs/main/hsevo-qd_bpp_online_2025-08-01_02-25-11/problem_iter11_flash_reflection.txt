**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), Heuristic 1st implements Best Fit with a small, constant consolidation bonus for used bins, explicitly using `bin_capacity`. Heuristic 2nd is a Best Fit with a numerically tuned `weight_remaining_cap` and `priority_no_fit`. The higher ranking of 1st suggests that a simple, robust consolidation bonus often outperforms a pure Best Fit, even if the latter's weight is supposedly "tuned."

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), Heuristic 3rd is identical in code to Heuristic 1st. This presents a strong inconsistency in the provided ranking, as 1st is ranked higher than 2nd, but 2nd is ranked higher than 3rd. Based on the code, 1st and 3rd should perform identically and thus be ranked equally. This implies external factors or an arbitrary aspect to the ranking for these identical heuristics.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), both apply a consolidation bonus to Best Fit. Heuristic 3rd explicitly takes `bin_capacity` as a parameter, which is reliable for identifying 'used' bins. Heuristic 4th *infers* `BIN_CAPACITY` from `np.max(bins_remain_cap)`. This inference is less robust, as it might not represent the true bin capacity if no empty bin is present. Additionally, 4th uses a significantly larger `CONSOLIDATION_BONUS` (0.01 vs 1e-6), which could overly bias towards consolidation, potentially sacrificing tighter fits. The explicit parameter in 3rd is generally more stable.

Comparing (6th) vs (8th), Heuristic 6th (Hybrid Fit with perfect fit bonus and tiny remainder penalty) is ranked lower than Heuristic 8th (Pure Best Fit). This is counter-intuitive, as 6th aims for more sophisticated optimization. This suggests that the fixed, aggressive bonus and penalty parameters (`1000.0`, `500.0`) in 6th might not be optimally tuned or are too disruptive to the core Best Fit principle, leading to worse performance than a simpler, consistent Best Fit approach.

Comparing (8th) vs (11th), Heuristic 8th (Pure Best Fit) performs significantly better than Heuristic 11th, which assigns zero priority to all bins, effectively making the choice random among fitting bins. This demonstrates that any intelligent prioritization (even simple Best Fit) provides substantial gains over no specific strategy.

Overall: The presence of multiple identical heuristic functions ranked differently (e.g., 1st, 3rd, 7th; 4th, 5th; 6th, 9th, 10th; 11th-20th) strongly suggests an inconsistency in the ranking method or the influence of external factors not reflected in the code. A small, well-controlled consolidation bonus (as in 1st/3rd/7th) appears to be a robust improvement over pure Best Fit. More complex multi-objective strategies, while conceptually appealing, are highly sensitive to parameter tuning; without it, they can underperform simpler, more robust heuristics.

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by prioritizing core objectives (e.g., Best Fit) and adding small, controlled bonuses (e.g., consolidation) for secondary goals. Avoid aggressive bonuses/penalties or unreliable parameter inference unless meticulously tuned. Simplicity and robustness often outperform complex, untuned strategies.
