Here's a redefinition of 'Current self-reflection', explicitly avoiding the points from 'Ineffective self-reflection':

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Emergent, Hybrid, Non-linear, Learning, Meta-heuristics.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics where global efficacy arises from local, non-linear interactions. Integrate adaptive components that learn from solution progress or problem characteristics. Explore hybrid strategies combining diverse principles.
*   **Avoid:** Limiting design to strictly monotonic, linear relationships or fixed, small-magnitude bonuses. Over-reliance on single, static baselines. Shying away from complex parameter spaces or non-obvious transformations.
*   **Explanation:** This approach leverages emergent properties and dynamic adaptation, moving beyond rigid, pre-defined rules. It embraces computational complexity and advanced tuning to uncover superior, context-aware solutions that fixed, simple methods often miss.
