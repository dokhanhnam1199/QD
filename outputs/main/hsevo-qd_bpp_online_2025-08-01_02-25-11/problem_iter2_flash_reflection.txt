**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both implement the "Best Fit" heuristic by prioritizing bins that will have the smallest remaining capacity. The core logic of assigning `-potential_remaining_cap` as priority and `-np.inf` for non-fitting bins is identical. The subtle difference lies in the order of operations: Heuristic 1st calculates `potential_remaining_cap` only for fitting bins after masking, while Heuristic 2nd calculates it for all bins first, then masks for assignment. The higher ranking of 1st suggests that masking *before* subtraction, potentially reducing the size of the temporary array for calculation, might offer a marginal performance or memory advantage in specific scenarios.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), both aim for tight fits. Heuristic 2nd uses a direct linear negation (`-remaining_capacity`) for priority, while Heuristic 3rd uses an inverse relationship (`1.0 / (remaining_capacity + epsilon)`). The ranking indicates that the linear negation approach is superior. The non-linear inverse, while aiming to heavily favor tight fits, likely struggles due to the `epsilon` term (which introduces a fixed offset and can blur distinctions between very small non-zero remainders) or simply provides a less effective gradient for decision-making compared to the simple linear mapping.

Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), these two heuristics are functionally identical in their source code, docstrings, and comments. Their differing ranks suggest either non-deterministic performance variations in evaluation or an arbitrary distinction within the ranking of similar performing heuristics.

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), Heuristic 10th still correctly implements a "Best Fit" strategy, differentiating between bins and correctly assigning `-np.inf` for impossible fits. In contrast, Heuristic 11th returns a constant array of zeros, effectively providing no intelligent prioritization and failing to mark impossible fits. This highlights the critical importance of having any intelligent heuristic logic that correctly prioritizes and handles infeasibility, as even a basic "Best Fit" performs vastly better than a null operation.

Overall, the list shows a clear hierarchy: sophisticated Best Fit variants (1st-10th) are superior to Best Fit variants with less optimal mathematical transformations (3rd-4th), which are in turn vastly superior to non-functional or non-prioritizing heuristics (11th-20th).

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics:
1.  Prioritize clear, monotonic relationships between desired outcomes (e.g., minimal remaining space) and priority scores.
2.  Explicitly handle infeasible options (e.g., bins that can't fit an item) by assigning them extremely low (negative infinity) priority.
3.  Be cautious with non-linear mathematical transformations or numerical "tricks" like `epsilon`; simpler linear approaches are often more robust and perform better.
4.  Any intelligent greedy strategy, even a basic one like "Best Fit," is significantly better than a null or random selection.
