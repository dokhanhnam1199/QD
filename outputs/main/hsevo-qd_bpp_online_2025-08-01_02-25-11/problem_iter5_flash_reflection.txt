**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st, 4th, 9th) vs (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th), we observe that the top-ranked heuristics (1st, 4th, 9th) implement a "Best Fit" strategy augmented with a `used_bin_bonus`. This bonus (`1e-6`) is added to the priority of bins that are already partially filled (i.e., not entirely empty/fresh). In contrast, the second group of heuristics (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th) uses a parameterized Best Fit, multiplying the `potential_remaining_cap` by a `weight_remaining_cap` (defaulting to -0.49...). The `used_bin_bonus` explicitly biases the selection towards consolidating items into existing bins, potentially delaying the opening of new bins. This targeted consolidation heuristic appears to be more effective than a simple weighted Best Fit in minimizing total bins.

Comparing (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th) vs (5th, 8th) vs (10th), all these heuristics fundamentally implement a "Best Fit" strategy by prioritizing bins that result in the smallest remaining capacity.
(2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th) use `weight_remaining_cap * potential_remaining_cap`.
(5th, 8th) use `2 * item - bins_remain_cap[fits_mask]`, which simplifies to `-(bins_remain_cap[fits_mask] - item) + item`, or `-potential_remaining_cap + item`. Since `item` is constant for a given call, this is equivalent to `-potential_remaining_cap` for `argmax` selection.
(10th) directly uses `-potential_remaining_cap`.
The slight difference in ranking among these Best Fit variants suggests that the specific `weight_remaining_cap` value in the 2nd group might be marginally better tuned for the problem, or the differences are negligible and reflect noise in the evaluation process. However, all these Best Fit variants demonstrate superior performance compared to the naive approaches.

Comparing (5th, 8th, 10th) vs (11th-20th), the "Best Fit" heuristics (5th, 8th, 10th) consistently outperform the lowest-ranked heuristics (11th-20th). The low-ranked heuristics simply return `np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)`, effectively giving equal priority to all bins where the item fits. This leads to arbitrary bin selection (e.g., first fit by index), which is generally suboptimal for bin packing as it doesn't try to minimize wasted space or consolidate items efficiently. The "Best Fit" strategy, by minimizing remaining capacity, actively works towards better packing density and thus fewer bins.

Overall: The most effective heuristics combine the core "Best Fit" principle with a specific mechanism to encourage the reuse and consolidation of existing bins over opening new ones. Simple Best Fit is generally good, and subtle parameter tuning might offer minor gains. Naive heuristics that don't prioritize intelligent bin selection perform significantly worse.

**Experience:**
For bin packing, "Best Fit" is a robust baseline. Enhancing it with a slight preference for existing, partially filled bins over opening new ones significantly improves performance by promoting consolidation. Avoid arbitrary or equal-priority choices, as intelligent bin selection (minimizing waste) is key to better solutions.
