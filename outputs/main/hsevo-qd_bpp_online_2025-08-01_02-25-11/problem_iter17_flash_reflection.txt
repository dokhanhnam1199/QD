**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (6th), the best heuristic significantly improves upon a pure "Best Fit" by adding an "Exact Fit Bonus" and an "Adaptive Fragmentation Penalty." This indicates that actively managing extreme outcomes (perfectly full bins or awkwardly fragmented ones) is more beneficial than just minimizing remaining capacity. The adaptive penalty, which scales with the current item's size, further refines this by making the penalty relevant to the context.

Comparing (1st) vs (4th), the 4th heuristic is a basic Best Fit scaled to produce positive scores. The superior performance of the 1st heuristic emphasizes that sophisticated, non-linear adjustments for specific bin states (like exact fits or near-full states) yield better results than merely transforming the linear Best Fit score.

Comparing (1st) vs (5th), both attempt consolidation. However, the 1st heuristic's "Exact Fit Bonus" and "Fragmentation Penalty" directly address the *outcome* of placing an item (filling exactly, or creating problematic remnants). The 5th's "Consolidation Bonus" scales with current fullness, but its small weight suggests it's a minor tie-breaker, less impactful than the targeted strategies in the 1st heuristic. This implies that managing final bin states is more critical than simply preferring already-used bins without considering the resulting space quality.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th/8th/10th), the simpler "Best Fit" (6th) surprisingly performs better than or equal to variants adding a tiny, fixed "used bin bonus" (7th/8th/10th). This suggests that a small, constant bonus for used bins isn't sufficiently impactful to consistently improve results beyond a solid Best Fit, or that the specific scenarios it helps with are less frequent or less critical than those addressed by the 1st heuristic.

Comparing (6th) vs (9th/11th), a pure "Best Fit" (6th) outperforms its slightly parameterized counterpart (9th/11th) which uses a `weight_remaining_cap` parameter. This indicates that merely parameterizing the linear component of Best Fit, or using a sub-optimal parameter value, does not necessarily improve performance over the standard Best Fit. The fixed `-1.0` implicit in pure Best Fit (6th) might already be near-optimal for this component.

Comparing (6th) vs (17th/18th/19th/20th), the basic "Best Fit" (6th) is significantly better than the "Target Remainder Fit" (17th-20th). This implies that, for general Bin Packing, aggressively minimizing the leftover space (Best Fit) is typically superior to trying to maintain a specific "ideal" non-zero remainder. The goal is usually to minimize the *number* of bins, which often means filling them as much as possible.

Comparing (12th/16th) vs all others, the worst heuristics assign zero priority to all fitting bins, essentially leading to an arbitrary or First Fit choice. This clearly demonstrates that *any* intelligent strategy for bin selection (even a simple Best Fit) is vastly superior to a non-strategic approach.

**Experience:**
Design better heuristics by embracing **hybrid approaches**: combine robust core strategies (like Best Fit) with **adaptive, non-linear rules** that specifically handle critical bin states (exact fits, problematic fragmentation). Strongly incentivize completion/closure of bins and avoid creating "awkward" empty spaces. Focus on the *quality* of the remaining space, not just its quantity.
