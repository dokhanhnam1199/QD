{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nSimplicity and robustness are key; a well-tuned Best Fit is a strong baseline. Small, controlled biases (e.g., consolidation bonuses) are often effective refinements. Overly complex heuristics or those with untuned, large-magnitude parameters can perform worse than simpler ones, as their intended benefits might be outweighed by unintended side effects or parameter sensitivity.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics:\n1.  Prioritize clear, monotonic relationships between desired outcomes (e.g., minimal remaining space) and priority scores.\n2.  Explicitly handle infeasible options (e.g., bins that can't fit an item) by assigning them extremely low (negative infinity) priority.\n3.  Be cautious with non-linear mathematical transformations or numerical \"tricks\" like `epsilon`; simpler linear approaches are often more robust and perform better.\n4.  Any intelligent greedy strategy, even a basic one like \"Best Fit,\" is significantly better than a null or random selection.\n\nFor bin packing, \"Best Fit\" is a robust baseline. Enhancing it with a slight preference for existing, partially filled bins over opening new ones significantly improves performance by promoting consolidation. Avoid arbitrary or equal-priority choices, as intelligent bin selection (minimizing waste) is key to better solutions.\n\nPrioritize consolidation: A well-calibrated bonus for existing, partially-filled bins significantly improves bin packing efficiency. The bonus value is critical \u2013 too small is ineffective, too large might override better Best Fit choices. Simpler Best Fit formulations often outperform overly complex or poorly tuned parameterized versions. Always establish a strong baseline (like pure Best Fit); random selection is detrimental.\n\nDesign better heuristics by prioritizing core objectives (e.g., Best Fit) and adding small, controlled bonuses (e.g., consolidation) for secondary goals. Avoid aggressive bonuses/penalties or unreliable parameter inference unless meticulously tuned. Simplicity and robustness often outperform complex, untuned strategies.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
