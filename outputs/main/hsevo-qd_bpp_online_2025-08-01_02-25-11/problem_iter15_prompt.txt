Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This implementation aims for a \"Best Fit\" strategy:\n    It prioritizes bins that, after the item is placed, will have the smallest\n    remaining capacity. This helps to 'tightly pack' items into existing bins,\n    leaving larger capacities open for larger items or reducing fragmentation.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf, dtype=float)\n\n    # Find bins where the item can fit\n    can_fit_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    # Calculate remaining capacity if the item were placed in fitting bins\n    potential_remaining_cap = bins_remain_cap[can_fit_mask] - item\n\n    # For fitting bins, we want to maximize the \"tightness\".\n    # A smaller remaining capacity means a tighter fit.\n    # To achieve this with argmax (which finds the maximum priority score),\n    # we can use the negative of the potential_remaining_cap.\n    # E.g., if remainders are [0.1, 0.5, 0.8], their negatives are [-0.1, -0.5, -0.8].\n    # The max of negatives is -0.1, which corresponds to the smallest positive remainder 0.1.\n    priorities[can_fit_mask] = -potential_remaining_cap\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nHere's a redefinition of 'Current self-reflection', explicitly avoiding the points from 'Ineffective self-reflection':\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, Emergent, Hybrid, Non-linear, Learning, Meta-heuristics.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics where global efficacy arises from local, non-linear interactions. Integrate adaptive components that learn from solution progress or problem characteristics. Explore hybrid strategies combining diverse principles.\n*   **Avoid:** Limiting design to strictly monotonic, linear relationships or fixed, small-magnitude bonuses. Over-reliance on single, static baselines. Shying away from complex parameter spaces or non-obvious transformations.\n*   **Explanation:** This approach leverages emergent properties and dynamic adaptation, moving beyond rigid, pre-defined rules. It embraces computational complexity and advanced tuning to uncover superior, context-aware solutions that fixed, simple methods often miss.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
