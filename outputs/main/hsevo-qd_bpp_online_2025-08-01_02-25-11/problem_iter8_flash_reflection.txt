**Analysis:**
*   **Comparing (1st/2nd) vs (3rd/9th):** Both employ a "Best Fit" strategy augmented with a "Consolidation Bonus" to favor partially filled bins. The primary difference lies in the `CONSOLIDATION_BONUS` magnitude (0.01 in 1st/2nd vs. 1e-6 in 3rd/9th) and the method of determining `BIN_CAPACITY` (inferred from `np.max` in 1st/2nd vs. explicit argument with `np.isclose` for robustness in 3rd/9th). The higher ranking of 1st/2nd suggests that a more substantial bonus (0.01) is more effective than a very small one (1e-6) at encouraging beneficial consolidation without unduly disrupting the Best Fit principle.
*   **Comparing (3rd/9th) vs (4th):** Heuristics 3rd and 9th are identical, adding a `1e-6` consolidation bonus to a Best Fit strategy. Heuristic 4th is a pure Best Fit implementation, maximizing the negative of the potential remaining capacity (`-potential_remaining_cap`). The higher ranking of 3rd/9th over 4th indicates that even a small consolidation bonus is generally beneficial compared to a strict Best Fit, as it helps reduce the total number of bins by prioritizing existing ones.
*   **Comparing (4th) vs (5th/6th/8th):** Heuristic 4th calculates Best Fit using `-potential_remaining_cap`. Heuristics 5th, 6th, and 8th are identical, also implementing Best Fit but via `2 * item - bins_remain_cap`. Both methods correctly rank bins by tightness of fit. The higher ranking of 4th suggests that its specific scoring range (0 for perfect fit, decreasing for worse fits) or numerical behavior is marginally more effective or stable than the alternative scoring, which uses `item` for perfect fit and decreases from there.
*   **Comparing (5th/6th/8th) vs (7th/10th):** Heuristics 5th, 6th, and 8th represent a standard Best Fit approach. Heuristics 7th and 10th are identical and represent a parameterized Best Fit strategy, where the weighting of `potential_remaining_cap` and the `priority_no_fit` constant are explicitly passed with seemingly "tuned" floating-point values (e.g., `weight_remaining_cap = -0.493...`). The lower ranking of 7th/10th indicates that these specific tuned parameters perform worse than the simpler, standard Best Fit approaches. This suggests either the tuning process was suboptimal, or the specific values don't generalize well, or that deviating from a simple `-1.0` weight for `potential_remaining_cap` is detrimental.
*   **Comparing (7th/10th) vs (11th-20th):** Heuristics 7th and 10th represent a sub-optimal but still functional Best Fit variant. Heuristics 11th through 20th are all identical, returning a zero-filled array, meaning all bins are considered equally preferable (or effectively random selection among fitting bins). This demonstrates that any form of intelligent packing, even if sub-optimally tuned, is significantly better than a completely unprioritized or arbitrary selection of bins.
*   **Overall:** The best heuristics strategically combine Best Fit with a consolidation bonus, with the magnitude of the bonus being crucial for performance. Pure Best Fit strategies are strong baselines, and their precise scoring formula can have subtle impacts. Parameterized heuristics, while theoretically flexible, can perform poorly if the parameters are not optimally chosen or if the tuning objective doesn't perfectly align with the problem's goal. Completely unprioritized bin selection is the worst approach.

**Experience:**
Prioritize consolidation: A well-calibrated bonus for existing, partially-filled bins significantly improves bin packing efficiency. The bonus value is critical â€“ too small is ineffective, too large might override better Best Fit choices. Simpler Best Fit formulations often outperform overly complex or poorly tuned parameterized versions. Always establish a strong baseline (like pure Best Fit); random selection is detrimental.
