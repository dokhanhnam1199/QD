### Redefined Current Self-reflection

*   **Keywords:** Monotonic Scoring, Consolidation Priority, Feasibility Handling, Linear Simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Redefine Best Fit scores monotonically (e.g., `1 / remaining_space` or `-remaining_space`). Add a *simple, linear* bonus for existing partially-filled bins to strongly encourage consolidation. Explicitly assign negative infinity priority to infeasible bins.
*   **Avoid:** Complex non-linear transformations or numerical `epsilon` for scoring. Arbitrary weighting. Implicitly handling infeasible choices; make it an explicit rule.
*   **Explanation:** A clear monotonic scoring, combined with a straightforward linear consolidation bonus, provides a robust, intelligent greedy strategy. Explicitly managing infeasibility ensures correctness and efficiency, significantly outperforming ad-hoc designs.
