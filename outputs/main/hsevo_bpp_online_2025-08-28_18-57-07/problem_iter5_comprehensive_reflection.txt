Okay, let's dissect this and build a framework for *better* heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a refined "Current Self-Reflection" distilled into actionable advice:

* **Keywords:** Stability, Vectorization, Edge-Case Handling, Focused Logic.
* **Advice:** Rigorously test with diverse, extreme datasets. Prioritize numerical robustness *even* at slight computational cost. Exploit NumPy's broadcasting â€“ it's your friend.
* **Avoid:** Overly clever shortcuts; they often break on edge cases. Premature optimization *before* a stable baseline.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on predictable behavior. Prioritizing stability and efficiency (via vectorization) builds a foundation; edge case handling ensures reliability. Simplicity aids understandability & maintainability.
