**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd), (4th), (6th), (7th), (8th), (9th) we see identical code. This suggests these versions are essentially the same and any ranking difference likely comes from external factors not evident in the code itself (e.g., subtle testing variations). These heuristics prioritize bins based on inverse waste (`1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value)`) when feasible, otherwise assigning zero priority.  The `small_value` addition is for numerical stability.

Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the (1st) is significantly more concise and leverages NumPy's vectorized operations efficiently. (5th) uses explicit loops, making it slower and less readable.  (5th) also only assigns a priority of 1.0 to the *minimum* waste bin, potentially ignoring other good options.

Comparing (1st) vs (10th), (11th), (12th), (13th), (14th), (15th), (17th), (18th), (19th), (20th) the (1st) performs similarly while being much more simplified. The later heuristics attempt to combine inverse waste with a minimum waste bonus. However, the loop-based implementation in (10th) through (20th) is less efficient than the vectorized approach of (1st). Additionally, the minimum waste bonus might not always improve performance and can introduce complexity.

Comparing (16th) vs all others, (16th) introduces a fragmentation penalty which could improve performance in certain scenarios, but it adds further complexity and a tunable hyperparameter (0.2).

Overall: The most effective heuristics (1st through 9th) prioritize minimizing waste with a feasibility check. Vectorized implementations are significantly better than loop-based ones.  Adding complexity (like the fragmentation penalty in (16th) or minimum waste bonus in (10th-20th)) doesn't necessarily improve performance and makes the code harder to understand.

**Experience:**

Favor simplicity and vectorized implementations when designing bin-packing heuristics.  A core principle is to prioritize bins that minimize waste *while* ensuring feasibility. Avoid unnecessary complexity (loops, extra parameters) unless performance gains are clearly demonstrated through testing. Numerical stability is crucial; use small values to prevent division by zero.
