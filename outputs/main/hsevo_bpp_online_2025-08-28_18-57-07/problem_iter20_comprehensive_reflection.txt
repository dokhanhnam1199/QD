Okay, let's refine heuristic design based on this extensive self-reflection. Here's advice geared towards maximizing performance, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Simplicity, Stability, Prioritization.
* **Advice:** Focus relentlessly on *feasible* bin selection first. Prioritize bins minimizing *immediate* waste (inverse remaining capacity is strong). Experiment with small, *multiplicative* fragmentation penalties. Leverage NumPy.
* **Avoid:** Premature optimization, complex waste calculations, redundancy, unnecessary parameters, and over-reliance on normalization.
* **Explanation:** Robustness (handling edge cases & numerical stability - `small_value`) and a clear, direct link to the objective (waste *after* feasibility) consistently outperform intricate logic. Simplicity aids maintainability & reveals core strengths.
