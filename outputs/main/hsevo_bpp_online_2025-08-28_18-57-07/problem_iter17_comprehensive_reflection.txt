Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design â€“ aiming for that $999K! Here's a distilled guide, stepping away from the pitfalls identified:

* **Keywords:** Feasibility-first, Stable Prioritization, Tunable Penalties, Simplicity.
* **Advice:** Focus relentlessly on core "best-fit feasible" logic. Employ multiplicative fragmentation penalties; experiment with coefficients. Prioritize inverse waste *after* feasibility is guaranteed, and validate all constants rigorously.
* **Avoid:** Explicit waste calculation beyond initial feasibility checks. Premature optimization. Complex normalization. Redundant code/functions.
* **Explanation:** Complexity often obscures the essential: quickly finding *any* valid placement before optimizing. Stability (avoiding errors) and tunable penalties allow focused refinement without breaking fundamental function.
