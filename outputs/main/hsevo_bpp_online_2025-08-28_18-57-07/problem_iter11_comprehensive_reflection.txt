Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to truly unlock heuristic design improvements. Here's a breakdown, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Feasibility-first, Waste-focused, Vectorization, Numerical Robustness.
* **Advice:** Rigorously benchmark *multiple* simple prioritization schemes (not just inverse remaining capacity) against each other *and* established heuristics. Focus on identifying patterns in failure cases.
* **Avoid:** Premature optimization. Don't add complexity *before* profiling reveals bottlenecks. Resist re-implementing existing NumPy functions.
* **Explanation:** The previous reflection focused too much on what *already* works. True improvement comes from exploring *alternative* simple strategies, systematically tested, and understanding *why* certain approaches fail, then vectorizing the winning strategy.
