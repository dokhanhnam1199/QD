Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into actionable design principles for superior heuristics, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Feasibility-first, Tunable penalty, Consistent logic, Numerical stability.
* **Advice:** Embrace a core "best-fit feasible" approach *always*. Experiment with a *small*, tunable penalty for fragmentation â€“ treat it as a regularization term, not a core objective.
* **Avoid:** Overly targeted early optimization (waste *before* feasibility). Complex scoring functions. Prematurely dismissing simpler approaches.
* **Explanation:** The original reflection correctly identifies simplicity & stability. By prioritizing *consistent* feasible placement and using fragmentation as a subtle guide, we encourage exploration and avoid getting stuck in local optima.
