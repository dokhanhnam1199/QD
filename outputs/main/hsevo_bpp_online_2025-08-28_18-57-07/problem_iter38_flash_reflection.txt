**Analysis:**

Comparing the 1st (best) heuristic against the 20th (worst), the primary difference lies in how the waste calculation and fragmentation penalty are applied. The 1st heuristic consistently uses `bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins] - item` for waste, providing a clear and direct measure. The 20th heuristic’s similar calculation is also good, but it seems to show up at the very bottom, hinting at nuances in how this is used downstream in a complete bin-packing system.

Comparing the 1st vs 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th heuristics we can see they are almost identical. The primary reason 1st heuristic is better than the others is that the best is the original function. A lot of the copies and duplicates were made during an attempt to optimize. 

The 7th heuristic attempts a slightly different approach using `np.where`, which can be less readable and potentially less efficient than the boolean indexing used in the others, and it’s fragmentation calculation is slightly different. The import of `random`, `math`, `scipy`, and `torch` in heuristics 16-19 add unnecessary dependencies, indicating experimentation that didn’t yield improvement. The subtle differences in `small_value` and `fragmentation_penalty` across some versions likely indicate a search for optimal parameters, but the base logic remained largely the same.

Overall: The core logic of best-fit inverse waste with a fragmentation penalty appears robust. The slight variations across the heuristics didn't improve performance and instead add complexity or unnecessary dependencies. The consistency of the top-ranked heuristic points to its inherent effectiveness. The duplication and minor alterations suggest a focus on parameter tuning rather than a fundamental algorithmic improvement.

**Experience:**

Prioritize code clarity and avoid unnecessary dependencies. Iterative experimentation is valuable, but maintain a clear baseline to assess the impact of changes. Don’t overcomplicate core logic with minor adjustments if they don't lead to measurable gains. Focus on refining parameters within a proven core algorithm before exploring fundamentally different approaches.
