Okay, here’s a refined self-reflection guide for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K reward!

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Stability, Simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize direct calculation of waste/fit. Employ a small, *relative* fragmentation penalty (bin capacity based). Vectorize with NumPy. Rigorously test parameter sensitivity.
*   **Avoid:** Complex prioritization logic, premature optimization, redundant code, unnecessary normalization, and absolute waste calculations.
*   **Explanation:** Robust heuristics consistently favor simple, numerically stable solutions. While penalties can help, they’re secondary to ensuring feasible, low-waste placements. Clarity trumps cleverness.
