Okay, let's dissect this and redefine "Current self-reflection" for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Exploration, Targeted Prioritization, Robustness, Efficiency.
* **Advice:** Focus on *diverse* prioritization signals *beyond* simple remaining capacity. Experiment with combinations (e.g., fit + future impact). Systematically explore the search space, not just greedy improvements.
* **Avoid:** Premature simplicity. Dismissing complexity *before* rigorous testing. Over-reliance on normalization. Treating robustness as the primary goal.
* **Explanation:** The prior reflection favored quick wins. This one advocates for **strategic complexity** â€“ investing in mechanisms that unlock better solutions, accepting initial overhead for potentially exponential gains. Robustness is maintained, but *serves* the core logic, not defines it.
