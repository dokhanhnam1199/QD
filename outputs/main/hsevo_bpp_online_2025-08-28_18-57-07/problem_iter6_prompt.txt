Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    return priorities\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    suitable_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if np.any(suitable_bins):\n        \n        min_waste = np.min(bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins] - item)\n        \n        indices = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0]\n        \n        for i in indices:\n            if bins_remain_cap[i] - item == min_waste:\n                priorities[i] = 1.0\n            else:\n                priorities[i] = 0.0\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's dissect this and build a framework for *better* heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a refined \"Current Self-Reflection\" distilled into actionable advice:\n\n* **Keywords:** Stability, Vectorization, Edge-Case Handling, Focused Logic.\n* **Advice:** Rigorously test with diverse, extreme datasets. Prioritize numerical robustness *even* at slight computational cost. Exploit NumPy's broadcasting \u2013 it's your friend.\n* **Avoid:** Overly clever shortcuts; they often break on edge cases. Premature optimization *before* a stable baseline.\n* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on predictable behavior. Prioritizing stability and efficiency (via vectorization) builds a foundation; edge case handling ensures reliability. Simplicity aids understandability & maintainability.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
