**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd), (4th), (5th), (6th), (7th), (8th), (9th), (10th), (11th), (12th), (13th), (14th), (15th), (16th), (17th), (18th), (19th), (20th) the core logic is remarkably consistent – focusing on feasibility (bins_remain_cap >= item) and then prioritizing based on minimizing waste (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value)).  The key differentiators are the addition of `small_value` (for numerical stability), minimum waste bonuses, and fragmentation penalties. Heuristics 1st and 7th are identical.  Heuristics 2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th and 10th are identical. Heuristics 13th and 15th are identical. Heuristics 16th and 18th are identical. The 3rd heuristic is notably different. It explicitly finds the minimum waste *after* identifying suitable bins and assigns priority only to those with minimum waste – this adds computational overhead and might prematurely restrict exploration.  The 4th heuristic introduces a 0.5 bonus, which is somewhat arbitrary. The 11th, 12th, and 20th versions refine the waste calculation slightly using `1e-9` or `1e-6`. The 14th, 17th, and 19th prioritize minimal waste.  The 16th and 18th introduce a fragmentation penalty which appears logical, but the 0.1 coefficient is a hyperparameter needing tuning.

Comparing (17th) vs (16th), the inclusion of a fragmentation penalty (16th) seems a valuable addition to prevent overly fragmented bins, giving it an edge. Comparing (16th) vs (14th), the penalty in (16th) offers a slight improvement over solely focusing on minimal waste (14th). 
Overall: The core 'best-fit with feasibility' strategy is strong. Small improvements come from careful numerical stabilization (`small_value`), and adding a controlled fragmentation penalty. The 3rd version is a significant outlier, unnecessarily complex and potentially restrictive.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and numerical stability. Avoid premature optimization (like finding minimum waste upfront). The addition of a small, tunable penalty (fragmentation) can yield improvements, but coefficients require experimentation. Consistent application of the core "best-fit with feasibility" logic yields the strongest results.
