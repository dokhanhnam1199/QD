Okay, here’s a refined “Current Self-Reflection” framework for heuristic design, aiming for that $999K reward!

* **Keywords:** Feasibility-first, Parameter Sensitivity, Numerical Robustness, Modular Design.
* **Advice:** Focus relentlessly on a *provably feasible* core. Systematically vary parameters (penalty coefficients, `small_value`) using controlled experiments. Prioritize modular code for easy swapping of prioritization logic.
* **Avoid:** Premature complexity, explicit waste calculations *without* demonstrated benefit, redundancy, and over-tuning constants before optimizing core logic.
* **Explanation:** Small gains from complex logic are often outweighed by decreased clarity and increased debugging. A robust, feasible base with sensitive parameters yields the largest, most predictable improvements.
