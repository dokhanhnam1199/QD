Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    small_value = 0.0001\n    fragmentation_penalty = 0.05\n    best_fit_weight = 0.6\n    first_fit_weight = 0.4\n    \n    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n    \n    if not np.any(feasible_bins):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n    \n    best_fit_priorities = np.where(feasible_bins, 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value), 0.0)\n    first_fit_priorities = np.where(feasible_bins, 1.0, 0.0)\n    \n    priorities = best_fit_weight * best_fit_priorities + first_fit_weight * first_fit_priorities\n    \n    priorities = priorities - fragmentation_penalty * (1 - (bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins])\n    \n    priorities[~feasible_bins] = 0.0\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's distill actionable advice for designing superior heuristics from this extensive self-reflection. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Numerical Stability, Parameter Tuning.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize a clean, core \"best-fit feasible\" logic. Rigorously *experiment* with tunable parameters (weights, penalties) \u2013 don\u2019t guess. Focus on relative penalties (to bin capacity) and maintain a clear baseline.\n* **Avoid:** Complexity, Redundancy, Premature Optimization, and over-reliance on explicit waste calculations *without* demonstrated improvement.\n* **Explanation:** The consistent theme is simplicity & stability. Minor code changes often yield minimal gains; impactful improvement arises from disciplined parameter tuning *guided* by empirical testing within a solid, fundamentally sound algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
