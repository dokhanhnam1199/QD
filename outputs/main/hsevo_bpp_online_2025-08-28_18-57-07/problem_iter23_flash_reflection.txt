**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see identical code. This suggests a redundancy in the ranking, as they should have distinct performance. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical. (1st/2nd) vs (3rd/4th) differ only in the `fragmentation_penalty` value (0.1 vs 0.05), which likely impacts performance. (5th) vs (6th), (7th), (8th), (9th), (10th), (11th) and (12th) show variations in how the `fragmentation_penalty` is applied, and how `small_value` is defined, and bin selection handled.  Heuristics (5th) - (12th) explicitly calculate `waste` and use it in the priority score, while others directly use remaining capacity. (13th) - (20th) are highly similar to (1st) and (2nd), with minor variations in parameter values or initialization but maintain the core logic. Notice the repeated code blocks in many heuristics, indicating an opportunity for refactoring. The presence of unnecessary imports like `random`, `math`, `scipy`, and `torch` in some heuristics (6th, 11th) without being used suggests bloated code, that may hinder performance or understanding. Overall, the ranking seems to be somewhat sensitive to small variations in parameters (`fragmentation_penalty`, `small_value`) and the way the fragmentation penalty is applied, but the core logic of prioritizing by inverse waste/remaining capacity remains consistent across the better-performing heuristics.

**Experience:**

Prioritize concise, well-documented code; avoid redundant code blocks. Parameter tuning (`fragmentation_penalty`) significantly impacts performance. Explicitly calculating waste can be beneficial. Removing unused imports reduces code bloat. A good heuristic combines feasibility, waste minimization, and fragmentation penalty thoughtfully.
