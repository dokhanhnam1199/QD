**Analysis:**

Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, which are identical, to the 3rd, also identical, reveals no differences. They all prioritize inverse waste minus a fragmentation penalty. Comparing the 1st/2nd/3rd to the 4th, we see the 4th explicitly calculates minimum waste and boosts priority based on it, adding complexity. The 5th-8th heuristics are all identical to the 4th, offering no improvement. Heuristics 6th and 9th attempt a simpler fragmentation penalty application, directly subtracting from priorities. They are less refined than the initial version. Heuristics 10th adds default values, which is good practice but doesn't impact the core logic.  The 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th all explore variations of best-fit with fragmentation penalties, differing mainly in `small_value` and `fragmentation_penalty` constants.  The 14th & 15th show a nuanced fragmentation penalty multiplying the fit score, which is more mathematically sound than subtracting directly. However, the constant 0.05 feels arbitrary. Overall, the earlier heuristics (1st-3rd) show a clean and conceptually strong approach, while the later ones introduce complexity with limited demonstrable gain or rely on potentially arbitrary constant tuning. The core idea of balancing inverse waste and fragmentation is consistent throughout, but the implementation and tuning vary in effectiveness.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and clarity. Explicitly calculating minimum waste (heuristics 4th onward) doesnâ€™t consistently improve performance. Carefully tuning fragmentation penalties is crucial; a multiplicative approach (14th/15th) appears more principled than subtraction. Constant values must be carefully validated. A clean inverse waste based prioritization seems to be more effective.
