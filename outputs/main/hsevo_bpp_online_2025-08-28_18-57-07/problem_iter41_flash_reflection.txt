**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st & 2nd, we observe they are identical. This suggests the ranking isn't based on code differences, but potentially performance in testing. Comparing 1st/2nd vs 3rd/4th/5th/6th/7th/8th/9th/10th, the core logic – best-fit inverse waste with fragmentation penalty – remains largely the same, differing only in minor variable names and comments.  Heuristics 11th-16th are very similar as well but a bit more concise. Heuristics 17th & 18th & 19th & 20th all look identical and include unnecessary imports (random, math, scipy, torch) which are never used, signifying a potential copy-paste artifact and reduced efficiency. Notably, the 'small_value' used to prevent division by zero varies across the heuristics (0.0001 vs 0.000664). The weightings of best-fit and first-fit strategies are only in the first and last two heuristics. Fragmentation penalty values also vary (0.05 vs 0.1). Overall, the heuristics cluster into groups with very minor differences, with later ones tending to include unnecessary imports. The highest ranked versions are more explicit in their weighting of best-fit and first-fit strategies.

**Experience:**

Prioritize code clarity and avoid unnecessary dependencies. Tuning parameters (small_value, fragmentation_penalty, weights) is crucial, but ensure this is supported by empirical testing rather than arbitrary selection. Consistent variable naming and comments improve maintainability.  A small "small_value" is preferred to avoid numerical instability, and including explicit weightings makes the heuristic's behavior more transparent.
