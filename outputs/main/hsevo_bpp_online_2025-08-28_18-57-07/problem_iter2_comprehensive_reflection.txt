Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into actionable heuristic design advice, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, focusing on maximizing bin-packing performance:

* **Keywords:** Simplicity, Capacity-Driven, Stability, Validation.
* **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics *directly* minimizing wasted bin capacity. Leverage inverse remaining capacity – it’s a strong signal. Explore slight variations (e.g., weighted inverse capacity) but keep them minimal.
* **Avoid:** Complex scoring functions, aggressive normalization (can obscure capacity differences), and any logic that sacrifices guaranteed feasibility.
* **Explanation:** Bin packing benefits from *stable*, easily-understood placement rules.  Overly intricate heuristics introduce noise & risk invalid solutions. Focus on efficiently utilizing available space.
