Okay, here's a refined strategy for designing bin-packing heuristics, distilling the "Current" & "Ineffective" reflections, geared towards maximizing performance and earning that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Fragmentation Penalty, Numerical Stability.
* **Advice:** Prioritize a core "best-fit feasible" logic. Employ a *relative* fragmentation penalty (to bin capacity) and tune it meticulously. Vectorize operations.
* **Avoid:** Explicit waste calculations beyond initial feasibility checks. Complex prioritization schemes. Redundant code/functions. Premature optimization.
* **Explanation:** Simplicity & numerical robustness consistently trump complexity. A small, well-tuned penalty addressing fragmentation *after* feasibility is key. Focus on concise, testable logic, avoiding over-engineering.
