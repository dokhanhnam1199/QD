**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (3rd) vs (4th), (5th) vs (6th), (7th) vs (8th), (9th) vs (10th), (11th) vs (12th), (13th) vs (14th), (15th) vs (16th), (17th) vs (18th) and (19th) vs (20th) reveal that these pairs are functionally identical. The only differences lie in docstrings.

Comparing (1st) vs (5th), the key improvement in (1st) is using `bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item + small_value` in the denominator of the priority calculation. This avoids potential division by zero and provides stability. (5th) uses a similar expression but lacks the `+ small_value`.

Comparing (1st) vs (6th), (6th) includes `(1 - fragmentation_penalty * (1 - (waste / bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins])))` whereas (1st) uses `(1 - fragmentation_penalty * (1 - (bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins]))`. The (1st) formulation is more consistent with minimizing fragmentation relative to the bin's full capacity.

Comparing (1st) vs (7th) and (8th), (7th) and (8th) are identical and simplify the fragmentation penalty term compared to (1st), potentially making them less effective at reducing fragmentation.

(1st) appears superior due to its balanced approach: best-fit inverse waste combined with a fragmentation penalty that considers the bin's capacity. It avoids potential division-by-zero errors with the `small_value` addition. The other heuristics either duplicate functionality or have simplified fragmentation penalties, or suffer from potential issues like division by zero.

Overall: The best heuristics consistently use a best-fit inverse waste approach, incorporate a fragmentation penalty relative to *total bin capacity*, and add a small value to the denominator to prevent division by zero. Redundancy and simplifications in fragmentation calculation generally correlate with worse performance.

**Experience:**

Prioritize numerical stability (avoiding division by zero) and ensure fragmentation penalties are relative to the binâ€™s full capacity, not just remaining waste. Small variations in formulations can drastically affect performance, so careful design and testing of the penalty term are crucial.
