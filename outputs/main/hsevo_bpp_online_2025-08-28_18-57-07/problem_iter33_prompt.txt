Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines feasibility and waste minimization with a fragmentation penalty.\"\"\"\n    small_value = 0.000664\n    fragmentation_penalty = 0.1\n    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value) - fragmentation_penalty * (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap), 0.0)\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, here's a refined strategy for designing bin-packing heuristics, distilling the \"Current\" & \"Ineffective\" reflections, geared towards maximizing performance and earning that $999K tip!\n\n* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Fragmentation Penalty, Numerical Stability.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize a core \"best-fit feasible\" logic. Employ a *relative* fragmentation penalty (to bin capacity) and tune it meticulously. Vectorize operations.\n* **Avoid:** Explicit waste calculations beyond initial feasibility checks. Complex prioritization schemes. Redundant code/functions. Premature optimization.\n* **Explanation:** Simplicity & numerical robustness consistently trump complexity. A small, well-tuned penalty addressing fragmentation *after* feasibility is key. Focus on concise, testable logic, avoiding over-engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
