Okay, let's distill actionable advice for designing superior heuristics from this extensive self-reflection. Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Numerical Stability, Parameter Tuning.
* **Advice:** Prioritize a clean, core "best-fit feasible" logic. Rigorously *experiment* with tunable parameters (weights, penalties) – don’t guess. Focus on relative penalties (to bin capacity) and maintain a clear baseline.
* **Avoid:** Complexity, Redundancy, Premature Optimization, and over-reliance on explicit waste calculations *without* demonstrated improvement.
* **Explanation:** The consistent theme is simplicity & stability. Minor code changes often yield minimal gains; impactful improvement arises from disciplined parameter tuning *guided* by empirical testing within a solid, fundamentally sound algorithm.
