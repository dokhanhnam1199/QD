Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Here's a breakdown, focusing on maximizing bin-packing performance:\n\n* **Keywords:** Simplicity, Capacity-Driven, Stability, Validation.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics *directly* minimizing wasted bin capacity. Leverage inverse remaining capacity \u2013 it\u2019s a strong signal. Explore slight variations (e.g., weighted inverse capacity) but keep them minimal.\n* **Avoid:** Complex scoring functions, aggressive normalization (can obscure capacity differences), and any logic that sacrifices guaranteed feasibility.\n* **Explanation:** Bin packing benefits from *stable*, easily-understood placement rules.  Overly intricate heuristics introduce noise & risk invalid solutions. Focus on efficiently utilizing available space.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
