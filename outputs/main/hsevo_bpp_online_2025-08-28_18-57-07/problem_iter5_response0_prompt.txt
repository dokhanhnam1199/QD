The better heuristics prioritize bins based on minimizing waste *after* placing the item, employing `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6)` or similar. The poorer heuristics also use the inverse remaining capacity, but often fail to handle edge cases where no suitable bins exist effectively, or directly use `bins_remain_cap / item`, which doesn't prioritize minimizing waste as well. Comparing 1st vs 2nd, they are almost identical.  3rd vs 4th demonstrate the inclusion of unnecessary libraries (torch, scipy) without a corresponding performance benefit. 8th, 15th, and 17th are essentially duplicates, showing redundant code.  The consistent use of `1e-6` or `1e-9` avoids division by zero.  However, checking `np.sum(possible_bins) == 0` versus `np.any(valid_bins)` then returning priorities can vary slightly but is overall similar. Overall, the better heuristics focus on a core principle \u2013 minimizing remaining waste \u2013 and implement it robustly, while the worse ones are either simplistic, redundant, or less focused on this key goal.\n- \nOkay, let's dissect this and build a framework for *better* heuristic design, aiming for that $999K! Here's a refined \"Current Self-Reflection\" distilled into actionable advice:\n\n* **Keywords:** Stability, Vectorization, Edge-Case Handling, Focused Logic.\n* **Advice:** Rigorously test with diverse, extreme datasets. Prioritize numerical robustness *even* at slight computational cost. Exploit NumPy's broadcasting \u2013 it's your friend.\n* **Avoid:** Overly clever shortcuts; they often break on edge cases. Premature optimization *before* a stable baseline.\n* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on predictable behavior. Prioritizing stability and efficiency (via vectorization) builds a foundation; edge case handling ensures reliability. Simplicity aids understandability & maintainability.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
