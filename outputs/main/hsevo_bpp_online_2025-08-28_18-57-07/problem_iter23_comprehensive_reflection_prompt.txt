{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize concise, well-documented code; avoid redundant code blocks. Parameter tuning (`fragmentation_penalty`) significantly impacts performance. Explicitly calculating waste can be beneficial. Removing unused imports reduces code bloat. A good heuristic combines feasibility, waste minimization, and fragmentation penalty thoughtfully.\nPrioritize simplicity and numerical stability. Avoid premature optimization (like finding minimum waste upfront). The addition of a small, tunable penalty (fragmentation) can yield improvements, but coefficients require experimentation. Consistent application of the core \"best-fit with feasibility\" logic yields the strongest results.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize simplicity and direct relevance to the bin-packing objective. Inverse remaining capacity consistently outperforms more complex approaches.  Normalization should be used cautiously. Ensuring valid bin selection (capacity >= item size) is crucial, and handling potential division-by-zero errors with a small epsilon value is good practice.\n\nPrioritize clear objectives (like waste minimization). Robustly handle edge cases (no suitable bins). Avoid unnecessary dependencies. Simple, focused logic consistently outperforms complex, redundant code. The `1e-6` addition is crucial for numerical stability.  Leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for efficiency.\n\nPrioritize waste minimization after ensuring feasibility. Inverse remaining capacity is a viable fallback, but less targeted. Robustness (handling division by zero) is important, but don\u2019t let it overshadow core prioritization logic. Redundancy (identical functions) indicates a lack of exploration.\n\nFavor simplicity and vectorized implementations when designing bin-packing heuristics.  A core principle is to prioritize bins that minimize waste *while* ensuring feasibility. Avoid unnecessary complexity (loops, extra parameters) unless performance gains are clearly demonstrated through testing. Numerical stability is crucial; use small values to prevent division by zero.\n\nPrioritize simplicity and clarity. Explicitly calculating minimum waste (heuristics 4th onward) doesn\u2019t consistently improve performance. Carefully tuning fragmentation penalties is crucial; a multiplicative approach (14th/15th) appears more principled than subtraction. Constant values must be carefully validated. A clean inverse waste based prioritization seems to be more effective.\n\nRedundancy is a major anti-pattern. Prioritize code clarity and eliminate unnecessary imports. Explicitly handle edge cases like no feasible bins for increased robustness. Consistent parameter naming and documentation are crucial for maintainability. Optimize for numerical stability (e.g., `small_value`).\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
