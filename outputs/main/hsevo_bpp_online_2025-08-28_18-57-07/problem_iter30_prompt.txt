Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines feasibility and waste minimization with a fragmentation penalty.\"\"\"\n    small_value = 0.000664\n    fragmentation_penalty = 0.1\n    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value) - fragmentation_penalty * (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap), 0.0)\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's distill those reflections into actionable heuristic design principles. Here's a breakdown, aiming for that $999K performance boost:\n\n* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Fragmentation, Numerical Stability.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize \u201cbest-fit feasible\u201d \u2013 directly minimize waste *within* viable bins. Use inverse remaining capacity as a tie-breaker. Carefully tune a *relative* fragmentation penalty (bin capacity based). Leverage NumPy.\n* **Avoid:** Explicit waste calculations (unless demonstrably superior), redundant code, unnecessary normalization, premature optimization, and complex formulations without rigorous testing.\n* **Explanation:** Simplicity & robustness win. Numerical stability (small epsilon values) prevents errors. Fragmentation penalties address packing efficiency, but require careful coefficient selection via experimentation \u2013 multiplicative penalties are preferred.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
