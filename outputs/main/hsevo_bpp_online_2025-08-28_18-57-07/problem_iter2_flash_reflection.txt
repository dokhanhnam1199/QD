**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v1` (1st) vs `priority_v1` (2nd), the first offers no prioritization whatsoever, while the second attempts a fit-based sigmoid scoring. `priority_v2` (1st) uses a sigmoid function to squash the fit score, preventing extremely high priorities. `priority_v2` (2nd) directly calculates the inverse of remaining capacity, offering a simple yet effective prioritization.

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) and `priority_v2` (3rd), both use inverse remaining capacity. However, the 1st version includes a more robust check `capacities[capacities < item] = 0` to avoid issues with negative capacity, while the 3rd uses `np.where`.

Comparing `priority_v2` (4th) vs `priority_v2` (5th), both calculate inverse remaining capacity. The 5th normalizes the priorities, ensuring a probability distribution, which can be beneficial, but potentially washes out distinctions.

Comparing `priority_v2` (6th) vs `priority_v2` (7th), both are functionally equivalent.

`priority_v2` (8th), (9th), (10th) and (11th) all use similar logic to calculate a priority based on remaining capacity, some with slight variations in variable names or checks. The 10th calculates a ratio of remaining capacity to item size which could be helpful.

`priority_v2` (12th) and (13th) apply an exponential function to the remaining capacity. This can emphasize bins with more capacity, but the exponential might be overly sensitive.

`priority_v2` (14th), (15th), (16th), (17th), (18th) and (19th) all calculate `bins_remain_cap - item`. The 16th and 17th normalize using `np.sum(priorities)`. The exponential in 16th and 17th introduces non-linearity but adds computational cost.

`priority_v1` in all versions is universally useless, providing a baseline for comparison.

Overall: The most effective heuristics prioritize bins based on the inverse of remaining capacity after accommodating the current item (`priority_v2` in versions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9). Normalization (as in 5th, 16th and 17th) can be helpful but must be balanced against potentially losing priority signal.  The sigmoid and exponential functions attempt to add non-linearity, but their impact needs careful tuning. The initial versions using the sigmoid, aren't that helpful.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and direct relevance to the bin-packing objective. Inverse remaining capacity consistently outperforms more complex approaches.  Normalization should be used cautiously. Ensuring valid bin selection (capacity >= item size) is crucial, and handling potential division-by-zero errors with a small epsilon value is good practice.
