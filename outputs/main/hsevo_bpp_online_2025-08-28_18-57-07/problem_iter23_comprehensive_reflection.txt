Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design principles, aiming for that $999K reward! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste, Fragmentation, Simplicity, Stability.
* **Advice:** Prioritize a core "best-fit feasible" logic. Experiment with *small*, tunable fragmentation penalties (multiplicative is preferred). Explicitly calculate waste *only* if testing demonstrates consistent improvement.
* **Avoid:** Premature optimization, complex prioritization schemes (beyond waste/fragmentation), redundant code, and over-reliance on normalization.
* **Explanation:** Robustness (handling edge cases/division-by-zero) is *foundational*, but core performance hinges on a simple, well-tuned prioritization of feasibility, minimizing waste, and managing fragmentationâ€”not intricate calculations.
