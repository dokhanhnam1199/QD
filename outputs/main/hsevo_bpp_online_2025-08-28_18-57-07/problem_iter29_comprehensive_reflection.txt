Okay, let's distill those reflections into actionable heuristic design principles. Here's a breakdown, aiming for that $999K performance boost:

* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Fragmentation, Numerical Stability.
* **Advice:** Prioritize “best-fit feasible” – directly minimize waste *within* viable bins. Use inverse remaining capacity as a tie-breaker. Carefully tune a *relative* fragmentation penalty (bin capacity based). Leverage NumPy.
* **Avoid:** Explicit waste calculations (unless demonstrably superior), redundant code, unnecessary normalization, premature optimization, and complex formulations without rigorous testing.
* **Explanation:** Simplicity & robustness win. Numerical stability (small epsilon values) prevents errors. Fragmentation penalties address packing efficiency, but require careful coefficient selection via experimentation – multiplicative penalties are preferred.
