**Analysis:**
Comparing the 1st (best) and 6th (worst) heuristics, we observe the 1st prioritizes bins based on minimum waste, aiming for efficient space utilization. The 6th, in its initial `priority_v1` function, simply returns zeros, effectively disabling prioritization. The 2nd (best) and 7th (worse) are identical: a common pattern. Comparing 1st vs 2nd, the 1st focuses on minimizing waste *specifically*, while the 2nd uses inverse remaining capacity, which can be less targeted.

The heuristics primarily differ in how they calculate priority. The top-ranked heuristics (1st, 10th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 19th) consider waste directly or use inverse remaining capacity with a small value to avoid division by zero. Heuristics 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th are almost identical – relying solely on inverse remaining capacity. The bottom-ranked heuristics (6th, 8th) are either non-functional or very basic, lacking any meaningful prioritization scheme. The repeated `small_value` constant (0.000664...) is a defensive programming technique against division by zero, found in the middle-ranked solutions.  The slightly different values used for the small value (1e-6 vs 1e-9) seem insignificant.

Overall: The most effective heuristics prioritize minimizing waste *after* establishing feasibility. Utilizing inverse remaining capacity provides a reasonable alternative, but explicitly considering waste proves superior. Empty or zero-based priority functions are demonstrably ineffective.

**Experience:**
Prioritize waste minimization after ensuring feasibility. Inverse remaining capacity is a viable fallback, but less targeted. Robustness (handling division by zero) is important, but don’t let it overshadow core prioritization logic. Redundancy (identical functions) indicates a lack of exploration.
