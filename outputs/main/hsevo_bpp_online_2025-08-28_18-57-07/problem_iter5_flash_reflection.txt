**Analysis:**

Comparing the top-ranked heuristics (1st & 2nd) with the bottom (19th & 20th), a clear pattern emerges. The better heuristics prioritize bins based on minimizing waste *after* placing the item, employing `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6)` or similar. The poorer heuristics also use the inverse remaining capacity, but often fail to handle edge cases where no suitable bins exist effectively, or directly use `bins_remain_cap / item`, which doesn't prioritize minimizing waste as well. Comparing 1st vs 2nd, they are almost identical.  3rd vs 4th demonstrate the inclusion of unnecessary libraries (torch, scipy) without a corresponding performance benefit. 8th, 15th, and 17th are essentially duplicates, showing redundant code.  The consistent use of `1e-6` or `1e-9` avoids division by zero.  However, checking `np.sum(possible_bins) == 0` versus `np.any(valid_bins)` then returning priorities can vary slightly but is overall similar. Overall, the better heuristics focus on a core principle – minimizing remaining waste – and implement it robustly, while the worse ones are either simplistic, redundant, or less focused on this key goal.

**Experience:**

Prioritize clear objectives (like waste minimization). Robustly handle edge cases (no suitable bins). Avoid unnecessary dependencies. Simple, focused logic consistently outperforms complex, redundant code. The `1e-6` addition is crucial for numerical stability.  Leverage NumPy's vectorized operations for efficiency.
