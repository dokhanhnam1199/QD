This suggests the ranking isn't based on code differences, but potentially performance in testing. Comparing 1st/2nd vs 3rd/4th/5th/6th/7th/8th/9th/10th, the core logic \u2013 best-fit inverse waste with fragmentation penalty \u2013 remains largely the same, differing only in minor variable names and comments.  Heuristics 11th-16th are very similar as well but a bit more concise. Heuristics 17th & 18th & 19th & 20th all look identical and include unnecessary imports (random, math, scipy, torch) which are never used, signifying a potential copy-paste artifact and reduced efficiency. Notably, the 'small_value' used to prevent division by zero varies across the heuristics (0.0001 vs 0.000664). The weightings of best-fit and first-fit strategies are only in the first and last two heuristics. Fragmentation penalty values also vary (0.05 vs 0.1). Overall, the heuristics cluster into groups with very minor differences, with later ones tending to include unnecessary imports. The highest ranked versions are more explicit in their weighting of best-fit and first-fit strategies.\n- \nOkay, let's distill actionable advice for designing superior heuristics from this extensive self-reflection. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* **Keywords:** Feasibility, Waste Minimization, Numerical Stability, Parameter Tuning.\n* **Advice:** Prioritize a clean, core \"best-fit feasible\" logic. Rigorously *experiment* with tunable parameters (weights, penalties) \u2013 don\u2019t guess. Focus on relative penalties (to bin capacity) and maintain a clear baseline.\n* **Avoid:** Complexity, Redundancy, Premature Optimization, and over-reliance on explicit waste calculations *without* demonstrated improvement.\n* **Explanation:** The consistent theme is simplicity & stability. Minor code changes often yield minimal gains; impactful improvement arises from disciplined parameter tuning *guided* by empirical testing within a solid, fundamentally sound algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
