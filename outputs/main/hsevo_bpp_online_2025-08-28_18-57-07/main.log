### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Prioritize simplicity and direct relevance to the bin-packing objective. Inverse remaining capacity consistently outperforms more complex approaches.  Normalization should be used cautiously. Ensuring valid bin selection (capacity >= item size) is crucial, and handling potential division-by-zero errors with a small epsilon value is good practice.
None

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(valid_bins):
        return priorities
    
    priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item + 1e-9)
    
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    n = len(bins_remain_cap)
    priorities = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(n):
        if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:
            priorities[i] = 1.0 / (1 + np.exp(-5 * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))
        else:
            priorities[i] = 0.0
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing `priority_v1` (1st) vs `priority_v1` (2nd), the first offers no prioritization whatsoever, while the second attempts a fit-based sigmoid scoring. `priority_v2` (1st) uses a sigmoid function to squash the fit score, preventing extremely high priorities. `priority_v2` (2nd) directly calculates the inverse of remaining capacity, offering a simple yet effective prioritization.

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) and `priority_v2` (3rd), both use inverse remaining capacity. However, the 1st version includes a more robust check `capacities[capacities < item] = 0` to avoid issues with negative capacity, while the 3rd uses `np.where`.

Comparing `priority_v2` (4th) vs `priority_v2` (5th), both calculate inverse remaining capacity. The 5th normalizes the priorities, ensuring a probability distribution, which can be beneficial, but potentially washes out distinctions.

Comparing `priority_v2` (6th) vs `priority_v2` (7th), both are functionally equivalent.

`priority_v2` (8th), (9th), (10th) and (11th) all use similar logic to calculate a priority based on remaining capacity, some with slight variations in variable names or checks. The 10th calculates a ratio of remaining capacity to item size which could be helpful.

`priority_v2` (12th) and (13th) apply an exponential function to the remaining capacity. This can emphasize bins with more capacity, but the exponential might be overly sensitive.

`priority_v2` (14th), (15th), (16th), (17th), (18th) and (19th) all calculate `bins_remain_cap - item`. The 16th and 17th normalize using `np.sum(priorities)`. The exponential in 16th and 17th introduces non-linearity but adds computational cost.

`priority_v1` in all versions is universally useless, providing a baseline for comparison.

Overall: The most effective heuristics prioritize bins based on the inverse of remaining capacity after accommodating the current item (`priority_v2` in versions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9). Normalization (as in 5th, 16th and 17th) can be helpful but must be balanced against potentially losing priority signal.  The sigmoid and exponential functions attempt to add non-linearity, but their impact needs careful tuning. The initial versions using the sigmoid, aren't that helpful.

Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into actionable heuristic design advice, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, focusing on maximizing bin-packing performance:

* **Keywords:** Simplicity, Capacity-Driven, Stability, Validation.
* **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics *directly* minimizing wasted bin capacity. Leverage inverse remaining capacity – it’s a strong signal. Explore slight variations (e.g., weighted inverse capacity) but keep them minimal.
* **Avoid:** Complex scoring functions, aggressive normalization (can obscure capacity differences), and any logic that sacrifices guaranteed feasibility.
* **Explanation:** Bin packing benefits from *stable*, easily-understood placement rules.  Overly intricate heuristics introduce noise & risk invalid solutions. Focus on efficiently utilizing available space.





Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    suitable_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    
    if np.any(suitable_bins):
        
        min_waste = np.min(bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins] - item)
        
        indices = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0]
        
        for i in indices:
            if bins_remain_cap[i] - item == min_waste:
                priorities[i] = 1.0
            else:
                priorities[i] = 0.0
    
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.

Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" into actionable heuristic design advice, aiming for that $999K! Here's a breakdown, focusing on maximizing bin-packing performance:

* **Keywords:** Simplicity, Capacity-Driven, Stability, Validation.
* **Advice:** Prioritize heuristics *directly* minimizing wasted bin capacity. Leverage inverse remaining capacity – it’s a strong signal. Explore slight variations (e.g., weighted inverse capacity) but keep them minimal.
* **Avoid:** Complex scoring functions, aggressive normalization (can obscure capacity differences), and any logic that sacrifices guaranteed feasibility.
* **Explanation:** Bin packing benefits from *stable*, easily-understood placement rules.  Overly intricate heuristics introduce noise & risk invalid solutions. Focus on efficiently utilizing available space.





Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in code review. Your task extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters.
User Prompt: 
[code]
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Combines inverse remaining capacity with a feasibility check."""
    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6), 0.0)
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
