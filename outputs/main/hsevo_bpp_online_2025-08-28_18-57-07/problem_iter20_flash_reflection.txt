**Analysis:**

Comparing the 1st and 2nd heuristics, they are identical. The 1st and 3rd are also identical. The 3rd and 4th heuristics are also identical. The 5th, 6th and 7th heuristics are identical, adding unnecessary imports. The 8th, 9th, and 10th are again identical. The 11th and 17th and 19th are identical. The 12th, 18th and 20th are identical. The 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th are identical.  The core logic for priority calculation – combining feasibility, inverse waste, and fragmentation penalty – is consistent across many implementations. The variations arise from redundancies in code, and minor differences in default values. The use of `small_value` to prevent division by zero is a good practice. The fragmentation penalty calculation `1 - fragmentation_penalty * (1 - (bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins])` appears consistently, aiming to reduce fragmentation. The heuristics that include the unnecessary imports (5th, 6th, and 7th) are worse due to added complexity and potentially slower execution. The heuristics that do not explicitly handle the case where no suitable bins exist (returning an all-zero priority array) are more robust.

**Experience:**

Redundancy is a major anti-pattern. Prioritize code clarity and eliminate unnecessary imports. Explicitly handle edge cases like no feasible bins for increased robustness. Consistent parameter naming and documentation are crucial for maintainability. Optimize for numerical stability (e.g., `small_value`).
