Okay, let's dissect this and formulate actionable advice for superior heuristic design. Here's a breakdown, aiming for that $999K tip!

*   **Keywords:** Relative Penalties, Numerical Stability, Core Logic, Iterative Refinement.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *relative* fragmentation penalties tied to bin capacity. Experiment with penalty coefficients, but *after* establishing a robust, simple "best-fit feasible" core. Prioritize consistent application of this core.
*   **Avoid:** Explicit waste calculation/minimization upfront. Complex prioritization schemes beyond relative fragmentation. Over-normalization or premature optimization. Redundancy in logic or code.
*   **Explanation:** The "ineffective" reflection shows complexity doesn’t guarantee improvement. The “current” highlights that nuanced penalties, *relative to capacity*, and a stable core offer more benefit. Iteratively build upon a strong, simple base.
