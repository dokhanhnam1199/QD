**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both calculate priority using inverse waste and fragmentation penalty, but 1st uses `waste = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins] - item` directly within the priority calculation, while 2nd uses `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value)` which appears less focused on best-fit. Comparing 1st vs 3rd, they are identical.  1st vs 4th: identical. 1st vs 5th: The main difference is the direct use of the waste value vs. using `bins_remain_cap - item`.  1st vs 6th: Identical to 5th. Comparing 1st vs 7th: Identical. 1st vs 8th-11th: these appear to be very similar with differing `small_value` and fragmentation penalty values. Comparing 1st vs 12th: 12th multiplies the inverse waste by `(1 - fragmentation_penalty...)` which reduces the impact of the inverse waste. Comparing 1st vs 13th-17th: largely similar variations in penalty and small value. 1st vs 18th-20th: these include imports (random, math, scipy, torch) which are unused, suggesting extraneous code. The repetition of the code (18th-20th are identical) is a strong signal of diminishing returns or an error in the optimization process.

Overall: The top heuristics (1st-7th) are very similar, focused on best-fit inverse waste with a fragmentation penalty.  The later heuristics introduce minor variations in parameters or unnecessary code.  The most consistent difference across all heuristics is in the fragmentation penalty calculation and the `small_value` used to prevent division by zero. The best heuristics minimize unnecessary calculations and directly incorporate the waste value into the priority scoring.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and directness in priority calculations. Focus on minimizing waste as the primary driver, and use a modest fragmentation penalty. Avoid unnecessary imports and code repetition. Parameter tuning (small_value, penalty) is important, but core logic should be concise.
