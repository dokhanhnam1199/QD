**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both are very similar, employing best-fit inverse waste with a fragmentation penalty. The 1st uses `waste = bins_remain_cap[suitable_bins] - item` directly in the fit score, while the 2nd uses `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + small_value)` which, though similar, subtly changes the weighting of the waste.  The 1st appears more efficient as it avoids redundant calculations.

Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the 3rd repeats the calculations of the 1st, adding an extra `if np.any(feasible_bins):` check which doesn’t add value as the initial `suitable_bins` check handles that.

Comparing 2nd vs 3rd, the 3rd is less concise, repeating calculations. 

The pattern across many pairs (e.g., 4th vs 1st, 5th vs 1st, 6th vs 3rd, 7th vs 1st, 8th vs 1st, 9th vs 1st, 10th vs 1st, 11th vs 2nd, 12th vs 2nd, 13th vs 12th, 14th vs 1st, 15th vs 2nd, 16th vs 12th, 17th vs 1st, 18th vs 17th, 19th vs 17th, 20th vs 19th) reveals a few key trends:

*   **Conciseness & Redundancy:** The higher-ranked heuristics consistently avoid redundant calculations and have more compact code. The repeated `if np.any()` checks and duplicated variable assignments in the lower-ranked versions negatively impact performance and readability.
*   **Direct Calculation vs. `np.where`:** Direct calculation (like in the 1st heuristic) is generally preferable to using `np.where` when the conditions are straightforward. `np.where` introduces overhead without providing substantial benefit in these cases.
*   **Small Value Impact:** The `small_value` parameter is crucial for numerical stability, preventing division by zero. The choice of value (e.g., 0.000664 vs 1e-6) does not seem to dramatically affect ranking, but consistency is important.
*   **Fragmentation Penalty:** The fragmentation penalty is applied consistently across all heuristics, and variations in its value (0.1 vs 0.05 vs 0.2) do not appear to be a primary differentiator in the ranking.
*   **Code Duplication:** The later heuristics (17th - 20th) demonstrate significant code duplication, and the introduction of default arguments (20th) without substantial algorithmic improvement leads to lower ranking.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st – 3rd) prioritize concise, direct calculation of priorities based on best-fit inverse waste and fragmentation penalty. Lower-ranked heuristics introduce redundancy, unnecessary complexity, and code duplication.



**Experience:**

Prioritize conciseness and avoid redundancy in heuristic design. Direct calculation outperforms conditional assignment using `np.where` for straightforward conditions. Carefully consider the numerical stability of your functions, but minor variations in constant parameters (like `small_value`) have less impact than overall code structure.
