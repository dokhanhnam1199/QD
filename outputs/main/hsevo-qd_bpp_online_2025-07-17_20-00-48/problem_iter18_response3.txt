    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors, including utilization,
    fragmentation avoidance, pressure, best fit, and empty bin preference, with adaptive adjustments
    based on item size and bin characteristics. It aims to improve upon priority_v1 by dynamically
    adjusting penalties and bonuses to better handle diverse item sizes and bin configurations.
    This version emphasizes a refined interaction between utilization and fragmentation, improved best-fit handling,
    and introduces a capacity-aware diversity bonus and a last resort strategy for very large items.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
