Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls.

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, adaptive, parameter tuning, edge cases, balance, fragmentation, practical, brittle, utilization.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that dynamically adapt to input characteristics (size, distribution) through parameter tuning based on feedback mechanisms. Combine diverse factors (utilization, fragmentation) with adaptive weights.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex designs, premature optimization, relying solely on rigid pre-defined rules, ignoring edge cases or potential division by zero errors.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are not static; they learn and adjust. Prioritize robust, adaptable designs by combining diverse factors carefully and addressing potential weaknesses proactively.
