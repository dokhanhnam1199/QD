**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of 'energy', 'potential well', and 'repulsion' inspired by physics, while the worst focuses on minimizing wasted space with a logarithmic function. There's a conceptual difference: the best uses a smoother, more nuanced approach, while the worst is more direct but potentially brittle. (2nd best) vs (second worst) - The second-best heuristic uses similar "physics" principles to the first, while the second-worst prioritizes filling bins to a target occupancy and includes some randomness, which seems less effective. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical, suggesting redundancy in the evaluation. (3rd) vs (4th) - The 3rd heuristic employs "Tesla's Resonance Principle" combining proximity to item size and utilization, while the 4th simply aims to minimize wasted space. The 3rd is more sophisticated. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst added "target occupancy", this idea might be not helpful. Overall: Better heuristics blend multiple factors with carefully tuned weights, often inspired by physical analogies. They tend to avoid overly aggressive strategies like solely minimizing waste or targeting specific occupancy levels. Stochasticity, when applied, should be subtle and balanced. The best heuristics often include mechanisms to prevent extreme fragmentation.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors with carefully chosen weights. Physical analogies can be a good source of inspiration. Avoid overly simplistic or aggressive optimization strategies that might lead to brittleness. Also, strive for balance when introducing stochasticity. Mechanisms that considers fragmentation are very helpful.
