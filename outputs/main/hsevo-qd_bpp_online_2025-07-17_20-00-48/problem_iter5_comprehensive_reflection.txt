Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristic design.

*   **Keywords:** Factor Combination, Adaptive Weights, Physical Analogies, Edge Case Handling, Stochasticity Balance, Fragmentation Consideration.

*   **Advice:** Combine diverse factors adaptively, drawing inspiration from physical systems. Prioritize robust handling of edge cases and data characteristics.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches, aggressive optimization, unnecessary complexity, and neglecting fragmentation issues.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics blend multiple relevant inputs with adaptable parameters. Physical analogies offer insights. Edge-case resilience, balanced randomness, and awareness of fragmentation are crucial.
