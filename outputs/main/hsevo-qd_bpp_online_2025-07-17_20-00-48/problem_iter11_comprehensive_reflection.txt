Okay, here's a refined definition of "Current Self-Reflection" aimed at designing better heuristics, incorporating your feedback:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, adaptive, validation, balance, edge cases, physics-inspired, interactions.

*   **Advice:** Focus on combining relevant factors and dynamically adjusting parameters. Prioritize rigorous testing and validation of any added complexity.

*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches, "black box" or aggressive strategies, and neglecting edge cases.

*   **Explanation:** Heuristics benefit from considering multiple factors and their relationships, adaptivity, and a balanced approach to complexity/stochasticity. Rigorous validation is key.
