Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors inspired by physics.\n    It considers the 'energy' required to place the item (smaller remaining capacity = higher energy),\n    a 'potential well' effect (bins with capacities slightly larger than the item are favored),\n    and a 'repulsion' effect (bins with capacities much larger than the item are discouraged).\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 'Energy' term: Higher priority for bins that are almost full\n    energy = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)  # Avoid division by zero\n    priorities += energy\n\n    # 'Potential well' term: Favor bins with capacities slightly larger than the item\n    diff = bins_remain_cap - item\n    potential_well = np.exp(-(diff**2) / (2 * (item/3)**2)) #Gaussian centered at item. Larger variance when item size is bigger\n    priorities += potential_well\n\n    # 'Repulsion' term: Discourage bins with capacities much larger than the item\n    repulsion = np.exp(-bins_remain_cap / (item*5))  # Exponential decay with bin capacity.

Here's a breakdown focusing on effective self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, weighted combination, physical analogies, robustness, balanced stochasticity, fragmentation awareness, adaptive parameters.\n\n*   **Advice:** Actively explore combinations of relevant problem features. Experiment with weighting schemes (e.g., adaptive weights). Model heuristic behavior on real-world systems.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, over-reliance on randomness without control, neglecting solution structure, and \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics often blend diverse insights. Balanced exploration and exploitation are key. Analyzing solution fragmentation helps maintain feasibility. Adaptive parameters help navigate complex landscapes.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
