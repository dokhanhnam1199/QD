Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, adaptive, interactions, validation, refinement, edge cases, parsimony (simplicity).

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that intelligently combine multiple relevant factors, dynamically adapting to item and bin properties. Pay special attention to the *interactions* between the factors.

*   **Avoid:** Simply adding complexity without thorough validation or neglecting edge cases.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on adaptive heuristics that address multiple concerns. Balance component heuristics' weights by careful testing. Prioritize clear logic and avoid overcomplicating code, but not at the detriment of performance or functionality.
