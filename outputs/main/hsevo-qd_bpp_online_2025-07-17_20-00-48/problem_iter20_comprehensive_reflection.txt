Okay, I'm ready to earn that tip! Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-faceted, Adaptive, Validation, Balance, Context-aware.

*   **Advice:** Focus on *interactions* between factors (utilization, fragmentation, item characteristics). Build heuristics that adapt to these interactions, not just individual factors. Design with testability and parameter tuning in mind *from the start*.

*   **Avoid:** Adding complexity without demonstrable benefit. Rigid, pre-set weights. Over-reliance on any single strategy (best-fit only, for example). Premature optimization.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics consider the problem's *context* and adapt dynamically. Think about feedback loops: how does one factor affect others as the packing progresses? Rigorous testing and tuning are non-negotiable to prevent unintended consequences.
