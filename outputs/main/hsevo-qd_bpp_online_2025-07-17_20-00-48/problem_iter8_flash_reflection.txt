**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates several factors like utilization, fragmentation avoidance, pressure, best fit, and empty bin preference, whereas the worst focuses solely on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) are very similar, but (2nd best) already contains several factors like utilization, fragmentation avoidance, pressure, best fit, and empty bin preference. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the difference is negligible, with both implementing the same logic; (3rd) vs (4th) are identical as well. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst considers both capacity and wasted space, while the worst only considers a ratio, making the second worst slightly more informed. Overall: The better heuristics consider a wider range of factors, including utilization, fragmentation, best fit, and special cases like empty bins and large items, while also using adaptive thresholds. The worse ones are simpler and focus on fewer factors, potentially leading to suboptimal packing.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interactions. Adaptive thresholds and penalties based on item size can significantly improve performance. Prioritize utilization, fragmentation avoidance, and best-fit considerations. Explore physics-inspired approaches, but ensure they translate effectively into practical packing improvements.
