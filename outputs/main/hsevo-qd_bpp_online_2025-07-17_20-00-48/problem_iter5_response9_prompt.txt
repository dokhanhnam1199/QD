Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors inspired by physics.\n    It considers the 'energy' required to place the item (smaller remaining capacity = higher energy),\n    a 'potential well' effect (bins with capacities slightly larger than the item are favored),\n    and a 'repulsion' effect (bins with capacities much larger than the item are discouraged).\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # 'Energy' term: Higher priority for bins that are almost full\n    energy = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)  # Avoid division by zero\n    priorities += energy\n\n    # 'Potential well' term: Favor bins with capacities slightly larger than the item\n    diff = bins_remain_cap - item\n    potential_well = np.exp(-(diff**2) / (2 * (item/3)**2)) #Gaussian centered at item.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar trend. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical, suggesting redundancy or potentially highlighting the stability of this particular heuristic. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical, indicating a lack of diversity in the lower-ranked heuristics. Overall: The better heuristics are complex, using multiple factors and adaptive parameters, whereas the worst are simple, one-dimensional calculations. The best heuristics also include considerations for edge cases (e.g., empty bins, items that don't fit). Adding random imports is useless.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for better heuristic design.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Factor Combination, Adaptive Weights, Physical Analogies, Edge Case Handling, Stochasticity Balance, Fragmentation Consideration.\n\n*   **Advice:** Combine diverse factors adaptively, drawing inspiration from physical systems. Prioritize robust handling of edge cases and data characteristics.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches, aggressive optimization, unnecessary complexity, and neglecting fragmentation issues.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics blend multiple relevant inputs with adaptable parameters. Physical analogies offer insights. Edge-case resilience, balanced randomness, and awareness of fragmentation are crucial.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
