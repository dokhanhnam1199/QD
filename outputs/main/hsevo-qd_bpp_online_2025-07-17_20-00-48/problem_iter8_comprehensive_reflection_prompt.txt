{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interactions. Adaptive thresholds and penalties based on item size can significantly improve performance. Prioritize utilization, fragmentation avoidance, and best-fit considerations. Explore physics-inspired approaches, but ensure they translate effectively into practical packing improvements.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors with carefully chosen weights. Physical analogies can be a good source of inspiration. Avoid overly simplistic or aggressive optimization strategies that might lead to brittleness. Also, strive for balance when introducing stochasticity. Mechanisms that considers fragmentation are very helpful.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and adapt parameters based on input characteristics. Prioritize handling edge cases and preventing issues like division by zero. Avoid unnecessary complexity.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
