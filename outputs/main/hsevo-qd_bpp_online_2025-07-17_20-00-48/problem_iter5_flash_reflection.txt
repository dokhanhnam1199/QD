**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates bin utilization, fragmentation, best-fit, and empty bin considerations, while the worst uses only the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar trend. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical, suggesting redundancy or potentially highlighting the stability of this particular heuristic. (3rd) vs (4th) are also identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical, indicating a lack of diversity in the lower-ranked heuristics. Overall: The better heuristics are complex, using multiple factors and adaptive parameters, whereas the worst are simple, one-dimensional calculations. The best heuristics also include considerations for edge cases (e.g., empty bins, items that don't fit). Adding random imports is useless.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and adapt parameters based on input characteristics. Prioritize handling edge cases and preventing issues like division by zero. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
