Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

There's a conceptual difference: the best uses a smoother, more nuanced approach, while the worst is more direct but potentially brittle. (2nd best) vs (second worst) - The second-best heuristic uses similar \"physics\" principles to the first, while the second-worst prioritizes filling bins to a target occupancy and includes some randomness, which seems less effective. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical, suggesting redundancy in the evaluation. (3rd) vs (4th) - The 3rd heuristic employs \"Tesla's Resonance Principle\" combining proximity to item size and utilization, while the 4th simply aims to minimize wasted space. The 3rd is more sophisticated. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst added \"target occupancy\", this idea might be not helpful. Overall: Better heuristics blend multiple factors with carefully tuned weights, often inspired by physical analogies. They tend to avoid overly aggressive strategies like solely minimizing waste or targeting specific occupancy levels. Stochasticity, when applied, should be subtle and balanced. The best heuristics often include mechanisms to prevent extreme fragmentation.\n- \nOkay, I'll help you refine \"Current self-reflection\" to avoid pitfalls and design better heuristics. Here's a breakdown focusing on effective self-reflection for heuristic design:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, weighted combination, physical analogies, robustness, balanced stochasticity, fragmentation awareness, adaptive parameters.\n\n*   **Advice:** Actively explore combinations of relevant problem features. Experiment with weighting schemes (e.g., adaptive weights). Model heuristic behavior on real-world systems.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, over-reliance on randomness without control, neglecting solution structure, and \"one-size-fits-all\" approaches.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics often blend diverse insights. Balanced exploration and exploitation are key. Analyzing solution fragmentation helps maintain feasibility. Adaptive parameters help navigate complex landscapes.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
