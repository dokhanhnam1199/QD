Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors, including utilization,\n    fragmentation avoidance, pressure, best fit, and empty bin preference, with adaptive adjustments\n    based on item size and bin characteristics. It aims to improve upon priority_v1 by dynamically\n    adjusting penalties and bonuses to better handle diverse item sizes and bin configurations,\n    and adding a bin diversity term.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    max_cap = np.max(bins_remain_cap)\n    num_bins = len(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    # 0.

Here's a structured approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptive, Factor Interaction, Validation.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by integrating multiple relevant factors (utilization, fragmentation, item characteristics) with adaptive parameters/thresholds. Emphasize understanding the *interaction* between these factors. Rigorously validate any parameter additions or changes.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly adding parameters without validation. Overly simplistic approaches that ignore crucial factors. Naive physics analogies that don't translate to practical improvements.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics benefit from multiple inputs but must be approached systematically. Adaptation based on input properties is key, but requires careful parameter tuning and testing. Understanding factor interactions leads to superior performance and prevents counterproductive strategies.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
