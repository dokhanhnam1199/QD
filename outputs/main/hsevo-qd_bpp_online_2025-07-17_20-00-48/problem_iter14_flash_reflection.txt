**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of utilization, fragmentation avoidance, pressure, best fit, and empty bin preference, along with a bin diversity term, using adaptive adjustments based on item size. The worst heuristic simply calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. (2nd) is nearly identical to (1st), suggesting stability. Comparing (1st) vs (4th), we see the best heuristic has "pressure term", (4th) includes pressure term.

Comparing (1st) vs (6th), (1st) utilizes adaptive adjustments for penalties and bonuses based on item and bin characteristics, with a bin diversity term. (6th) combines utilization, fragmentation, best fit, and empty bin considerations with fixed weights. (7th) is a simplified version of (6th), focusing on utilization and fragmentation reduction with adaptive parameter adjustment.

Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), both use ratios, but (2nd worst) also imports unused libraries, suggesting code bloat and lack of focus. Overall, the best heuristics utilize multiple factors, adaptive adjustments, and potentially a diversity term, while worse heuristics are simpler and may lack adaptive parameters or clear goals. Adding unused libraries is related to low-quality design.

**Experience:**
Prioritize a multi-faceted approach that considers utilization, fragmentation, and other relevant factors. Adaptive adjustments based on item and bin characteristics are crucial. Regularly re-evaluate and refine weighting of component heuristics. Avoid unnecessary code.
