Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

The worst heuristic simply calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. (2nd) is nearly identical to (1st), suggesting stability. Comparing (1st) vs (4th), we see the best heuristic has \"pressure term\", (4th) includes pressure term.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (6th), (1st) utilizes adaptive adjustments for penalties and bonuses based on item and bin characteristics, with a bin diversity term. (6th) combines utilization, fragmentation, best fit, and empty bin considerations with fixed weights. (7th) is a simplified version of (6th), focusing on utilization and fragmentation reduction with adaptive parameter adjustment.\n\nComparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), both use ratios, but (2nd worst) also imports unused libraries, suggesting code bloat and lack of focus. Overall, the best heuristics utilize multiple factors, adaptive adjustments, and potentially a diversity term, while worse heuristics are simpler and may lack adaptive parameters or clear goals. Adding unused libraries is related to low-quality design.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls. Here's a structured approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted, Adaptive, Factor Interaction, Validation.\n\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by integrating multiple relevant factors (utilization, fragmentation, item characteristics) with adaptive parameters/thresholds. Emphasize understanding the *interaction* between these factors. Rigorously validate any parameter additions or changes.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly adding parameters without validation. Overly simplistic approaches that ignore crucial factors. Naive physics analogies that don't translate to practical improvements.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics benefit from multiple inputs but must be approached systematically. Adaptation based on input properties is key, but requires careful parameter tuning and testing. Understanding factor interactions leads to superior performance and prevents counterproductive strategies.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
