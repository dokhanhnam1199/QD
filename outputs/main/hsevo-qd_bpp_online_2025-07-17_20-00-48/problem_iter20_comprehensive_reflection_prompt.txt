{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a combination of relevant factors and gradually refine them. Adaptive adjustments based on the problem's characteristics (e.g., item size, bin capacity) are crucial. Regularly test and evaluate the impact of each component to avoid unnecessary complexity.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors with carefully chosen weights. Physical analogies can be a good source of inspiration. Avoid overly simplistic or aggressive optimization strategies that might lead to brittleness. Also, strive for balance when introducing stochasticity. Mechanisms that considers fragmentation are very helpful.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and adapt parameters based on input characteristics. Prioritize handling edge cases and preventing issues like division by zero. Avoid unnecessary complexity.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interactions. Adaptive thresholds and penalties based on item size can significantly improve performance. Prioritize utilization, fragmentation avoidance, and best-fit considerations. Explore physics-inspired approaches, but ensure they translate effectively into practical packing improvements.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nPrioritize multi-faceted heuristics considering utilization, fragmentation, and best fit. Adapt parameters dynamically based on item and bin characteristics. Thoroughly test and tune added parameters, as simply adding more without validation can degrade performance. Simplicity should be considered but not at the cost of crucial factors.\n\nPrioritize a multi-faceted approach that considers utilization, fragmentation, and other relevant factors. Adaptive adjustments based on item and bin characteristics are crucial. Regularly re-evaluate and refine weighting of component heuristics. Avoid unnecessary code.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize a multi-faceted approach. Incorporate diverse factors like utilization, fragmentation, and diversity. Adapt parameters to item characteristics and bin configurations for improved performance. Carefully weight the impact of each factor to achieve a balanced solution.\n```\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
