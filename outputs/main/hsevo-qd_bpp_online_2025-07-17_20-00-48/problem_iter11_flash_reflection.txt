**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach, considering utilization, fragmentation, pressure, best fit, empty bin preference and diversity, with adaptive adjustments based on item size and bin characteristics. The 20th heuristic solely relies on the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity and its logarithm.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the 2nd heuristic also employs multiple factors like utilization, fragmentation avoidance with penalties, pressure term, best fit bonus, and empty bin preference but lacks diversity term. The 19th heuristic, similar to the 20th, uses only the ratio of item and bin capacity, without considering other crucial factors.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st includes bin diversity and dynamically adjusts penalties/bonuses while 2nd uses fixed penalties and lacks the diversity element.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), there is no difference. They are the same.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there is no difference. They are the same.
Comparing (15th) vs (16th), there is no difference. They are the same.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a wider range of factors, adapt parameters based on item size and bin characteristics, and dynamically adjust penalties and bonuses. The worse heuristics are simplistic, focusing on a single factor and lacking adaptability. Including too many parameters, as in the 3rd, 15th and 16th, can be detrimental without proper tuning. The physics-inspired heuristics perform poorly, suggesting that simply applying a different analogy may not lead to superior packing strategies.

**Experience:**

Prioritize multi-faceted heuristics considering utilization, fragmentation, and best fit. Adapt parameters dynamically based on item and bin characteristics. Thoroughly test and tune added parameters, as simply adding more without validation can degrade performance. Simplicity should be considered but not at the cost of crucial factors.
