    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors, focusing on
    bin utilization and fragmentation reduction. It adaptively adjusts parameters
    based on item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        frag_threshold_ratio:  Adjust as needed; smaller items shouldn't create very small fragments
        frag_penalty_weight: Lower weight than utilization
        best_fit_bonus_value: Bonus given to the best fit option.
        large_item_threshold_ratio: Threshold to determine if an item is large relative to bin capacity.
        empty_bin_bonus: Priority bonus for placing large items in empty bins.
        small_number: A small number to prevent division by zero.
        utilization_weight: Weight of the utilization term.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
