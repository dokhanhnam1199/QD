The 20th heuristic solely relies on the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity and its logarithm.\nComparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the 2nd heuristic also employs multiple factors like utilization, fragmentation avoidance with penalties, pressure term, best fit bonus, and empty bin preference but lacks diversity term. The 19th heuristic, similar to the 20th, uses only the ratio of item and bin capacity, without considering other crucial factors.\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st includes bin diversity and dynamically adjusts penalties/bonuses while 2nd uses fixed penalties and lacks the diversity element.\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), there is no difference. They are the same.\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), there is no difference. They are the same.\nComparing (15th) vs (16th), there is no difference. They are the same.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics incorporate a wider range of factors, adapt parameters based on item size and bin characteristics, and dynamically adjust penalties and bonuses. The worse heuristics are simplistic, focusing on a single factor and lacking adaptability. Including too many parameters, as in the 3rd, 15th and 16th, can be detrimental without proper tuning. The physics-inspired heuristics perform poorly, suggesting that simply applying a different analogy may not lead to superior packing strategies.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined definition of \"Current Self-Reflection\" aimed at designing better heuristics, incorporating your feedback:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, adaptive, validation, balance, edge cases, physics-inspired, interactions.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on combining relevant factors and dynamically adjusting parameters. Prioritize rigorous testing and validation of any added complexity.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly simplistic approaches, \"black box\" or aggressive strategies, and neglecting edge cases.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Heuristics benefit from considering multiple factors and their relationships, adaptivity, and a balanced approach to complexity/stochasticity. Rigorous validation is key.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
