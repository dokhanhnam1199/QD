Okay, I'll help you refine "Current self-reflection" to avoid pitfalls and design better heuristics. Here's a breakdown focusing on effective self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, weighted combination, physical analogies, robustness, balanced stochasticity, fragmentation awareness, adaptive parameters.

*   **Advice:** Actively explore combinations of relevant problem features. Experiment with weighting schemes (e.g., adaptive weights). Model heuristic behavior on real-world systems.

*   **Avoid:** Premature convergence, over-reliance on randomness without control, neglecting solution structure, and "one-size-fits-all" approaches.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics often blend diverse insights. Balanced exploration and exploitation are key. Analyzing solution fragmentation helps maintain feasibility. Adaptive parameters help navigate complex landscapes.
