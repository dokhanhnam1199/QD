Prioritize feasibility, reward near-full bins, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.

The improved heuristic incorporates feasibility, capacity utilization, bonuses, randomness, and first-fit aspects.

The better code incorporates feasibility, utilization, randomness, and special cases (nearly empty/full bins) for improved performance.

Prioritize feasibility and tight fits. Use appropriate scaling and avoid masking with large constants.

The better code uses feasibility checks, capacity utilization, bonuses for near-full/empty bins, and randomness for exploration.

The better code uses more nuanced prioritization with inverse square and almost empty bin bonuses, and avoids hardcoded bin capacity.

The better code removes the no-fit scenario handling. This suggests focusing on bin utilization and perfect fits is key.

The better code combines feasibility, capacity utilization, randomness, and targeted bonuses for improved bin packing.

The better code uses inverse square remaining capacity, perfect fit bonus, and nearly empty bin prioritization.

Tighter fit penalization, stronger "almost full" bonus, scaled randomness, and nearly empty bin prioritization improve performance.
