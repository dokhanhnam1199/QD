Feasibility, utilization, bonuses for almost-full/empty bins, and randomness improve online bin packing heuristics.

Prioritize feasibility more strictly. Refine reward functions for tighter fits and almost-full bins. Tune randomness.

Feasibility, utilization, fill-up bonus, randomness, and first-fit considerations improve bin packing heuristic performance.

Prioritize feasibility, reward tighter fits and almost-full bins, and add controlled randomness.

Feasibility, tightness of fit, filling almost full bins, randomness, and nearly empty bin prioritization are key.

Prioritize feasibility, fill ratio, almost-full bins, and controlled randomness. Handle no-fit scenarios gracefully.

Prioritize feasibility ruthlessly. Use non-linear remaining capacity scores. Add controlled randomness and "First-Fit" incentives.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, filling almost full bins, and introducing scaled randomness, alongside first-fit preference.

Feasibility, remaining capacity, filling almost full bins, randomness, and nearly empty bin consideration improve performance.

Prioritize feasibility, utilization, and near-full/empty bins. Add scaled randomness for exploration. Avoid division by zero.
