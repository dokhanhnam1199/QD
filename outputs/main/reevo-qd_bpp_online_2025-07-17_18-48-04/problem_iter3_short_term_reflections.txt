Prioritize tight fits, penalize wasted space, and add randomness for exploration. Avoid near-miss penalties.

Prioritize feasibility, utilize remaining capacity, encourage full bins, and add randomness for exploration.

Prioritize tight fits and consolidation. If no fit, prefer opening the fullest bin.

Focus on feasibility, tight fits, filling almost-full bins, and introducing controlled randomness.

Prioritize tight fits and consolidation. If no fit exists, prefer largest capacity bin. Avoid infinite penalties.

Prioritize feasibility, exploit tight fits, and add randomness with bonuses for almost-full bins.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste, and penalize infeasible assignments for improved bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, utilize remaining capacity tightly, fill almost-full bins, and add randomness.

Prioritize feasibility, utilize remaining capacity, fill almost full bins, and add randomness for exploration.

Prioritize tight fits. Heavily reward high fill ratios to reduce fragmentation. Avoid explicitly handling infeasibility.
