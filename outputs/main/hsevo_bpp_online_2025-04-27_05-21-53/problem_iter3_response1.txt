def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors, including remaining capacity,
    item size relative to bin size, and a penalty for creating small fragments.
    It also incorporates a mechanism to encourage exploration of less-utilized bins
    initially and then shift toward filling bins more completely as the packing
    progresses (Adaptive behavior).

    Args:
        item (float): The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array containing the priority score for each bin.
