Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Bins that can't fit get a negative infinite priority\n    priorities = np.where(bins_remain_cap < item, -np.inf, 0)\n\n    # For bins that can fit, prioritize those with smallest remaining capacity *after* packing the item.

Larger temperature differences(bins with little space after adding the item) should be cooled down quickly(higher priority).\n    # We invert it, so the colder temp gets larger values\n    priorities[bins_remain_cap >= item] = -post_fill_waste\n\n    #Add a small bias to partially filled bins to encourage them being completely full\n    priorities[bins_remain_cap >= item] += 0.01*(bins_remain_cap[bins_remain_cap >= item]/ np.max(bins_remain_cap)) # add a fraction of the remaining capacity compared to maximum capacity to all bins\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This function prioritizes bins that can fit the item snugly but avoids nearly full bins unless absolutely necessary.\n    It also includes a small random factor to break ties and encourage exploration of different packing configurations,\n    mimicking the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena near event horizons.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Calculate wasted space if the item is placed in each bin.

The best approaches also incorporate scaling factors or biases to encourage complete filling and avoid creating bins that can only hold very small items. Poorer performing heuristics have less sophisticated logic that do not account for edge cases and duplicate code.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to make it more effective for heuristic design, focusing on avoiding pitfalls and leading to better heuristics.\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Learning, Outcome Analysis, Solution Diversity, Algorithmic Bias.\n*   **Advice:** Analyze heuristic *performance* across diverse problem instances and parameter settings. Quantify solution *quality*, not just feasibility. Explicitly track *algorithmic bias* and design heuristics to mitigate it. Explore diverse solution pathways and avoid premature convergence.\n*   **Avoid:** Focusing solely on mathematical models without empirical validation. Ignoring the impact of parameter tuning on heuristic performance. Neglecting the exploration of alternative solution generation strategies.\n*   **Explanation:** Shift from static rules to adaptive learning from results. Validate and prevent bias. Aim for more diverse and better solutions.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
