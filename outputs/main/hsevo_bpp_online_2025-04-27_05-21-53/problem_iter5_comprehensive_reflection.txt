
Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptability, Exploration, Transparency, Multi-objective.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize flexible designs with adaptive parameters and stochastic elements for robust exploration. Ensure interpretability.
*   **Avoid:** Rigid, hardcoded parameters; redundant code; focusing solely on single objectives.
*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to problem characteristics, actively explore the solution space, and are easily understood and maintained.
