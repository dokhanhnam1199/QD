    """
    Prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors, including remaining capacity,
    item size relative to bin size, and a penalty for creating small fragments.
    It also incorporates a mechanism to encourage exploration of less-utilized bins
    initially and then shift toward filling bins more completely as the packing
    progresses (Adaptive behavior).

    Args:
        item (float): The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.
        exploration_weight (float): Weight for exploration factor.
        almost_full_boost (float): Boost for almost full bins.
        small_remainder_penalty (float): Penalty for small remainders.
        near_perfect_fit_penalty (float): Penalty for near perfect fits.
        moderate_fit_bonus (float): Bonus for moderate fits.
        almost_full_threshold (float): Threshold for considering a bin almost full (fraction of bin size).
        small_remainder_threshold (float): Threshold for considering a remainder small (fraction of bin size).
        near_perfect_fit_threshold (float): Threshold for considering a fit near perfect (fraction of bin size).
        moderate_fit_threshold_low (float): Lower threshold for moderate fit (fraction of bin size).
        moderate_fit_threshold_high (float): Higher threshold for moderate fit (fraction of bin size).

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array containing the priority score for each bin.
