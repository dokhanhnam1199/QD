**Analysis:**

*   Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st one uses a `bin_level_threshold` and `bin_level_boost` and adapts exploration based on the average bin level, while the 2nd one introduces `bin_diversity_penalty`, `utilization_exponent`, and `random_factor`.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (3rd), we see that the 1st one uses a `bin_level_threshold` and `bin_level_boost` and adapts exploration based on the average bin level, while the 3rd one introduces `capacity_usage_exponent`, `large_item_penalty`, and `large_item_threshold`.
*   Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we see that the 2nd one introduces `bin_diversity_penalty` and `random_factor` while the 3rd one introduces `large_item_penalty` and `large_item_threshold`. Both have `capacity_usage_exponent`.
*   Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the code is the same.
*   Comparing (2nd) vs (6th), both use similar parameters like `exploration_weight`, `almost_full_boost`, etc. However, the 6th function uses some imported libraries and fixed values for parameters. The 2nd one introduces `bin_diversity_penalty`, `utilization_exponent`, and `random_factor`.
*   Comparing (1st) vs (7th), the 1st version incorporates many configurable parameters and adaptive exploration while the 7th version is highly simplified with hardcoded constants and less sophisticated exploration.
*   Comparing (7th) vs (8th), the code is the same.
*   Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see that the 2nd worst has adaptive parameters based on item sizes and a Gaussian boost, whereas the worst one lacks this adaptivity and boost. Both versions priorize bins considering fullness, fragmentation, and item size.
*   Comparing (second best) vs (second worst) the second best is using constant parameters, while the second worst is using dynamic parameters.

Overall: The better heuristics tend to incorporate more sophisticated mechanisms for exploration, adaptive parameter adjustments, and penalties/bonuses based on a broader range of factors (e.g., bin diversity, item size). Simpler heuristics with hardcoded constants generally perform worse. It is evident that adaptive parameter adjustments based on item sizes leads to improved packing efficiency.

**Experience:**

Adapt heuristics to item sizes, and dynamically adjust exploration based on average bin fill levels. Penalize near-perfect fits, reward moderate fits, and discourage small remainders.
Consider both exploration of less-utilized bins and exploitation of almost-full bins and add diversity to avoid premature convergence.
