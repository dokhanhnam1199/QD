    """
    Prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors, adaptively adjusting
    exploration and exploitation based on bin utilization levels. Adds a bin-level
    consideration to further refine bin selection and incorporates a degree of randomness.
    Also introduces a penalty based on variance of remaining capacities to promote even fill.

    Args:
        item (float): The size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap (np.ndarray): An array containing the remaining capacity of each bin.
        exploration_weight (float): Weight for exploration factor.
        almost_full_boost (float): Boost for almost full bins.
        small_remainder_penalty (float): Penalty for small remainders.
        near_perfect_fit_penalty (float): Penalty for near perfect fits.
        moderate_fit_bonus (float): Bonus for moderate fits.
        almost_full_threshold (float): Threshold for considering a bin almost full (fraction of bin size).
        small_remainder_threshold (float): Threshold for considering a remainder small (fraction of bin size).
        near_perfect_fit_threshold (float): Threshold for considering a fit near perfect (fraction of bin size).
        moderate_fit_threshold_low: Lower threshold for moderate fit (fraction of bin size).
        moderate_fit_threshold_high: Higher threshold for moderate fit (fraction of bin size).
        bin_level_threshold (float): Threshold to consider a bin at a certain level.
        bin_level_boost (float): Boost for bins that have passed the bin level.
        random_factor (float): Scaling factor for random component.
        capacity_variance_penalty (float): Penalty scaling factor for variance in remaining capacity

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array containing the priority score for each bin.
