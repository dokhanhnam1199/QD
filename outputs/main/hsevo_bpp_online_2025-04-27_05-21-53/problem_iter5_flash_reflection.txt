**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st heuristic has a lot of tunable hyper parameters that could be optimized with enough experimentation to get better packing results. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th) we see the inverse, the 2nd heuristic is too rigid and has too little parameters. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic has more parameters, which gives it more flexibility and adaptability, where the second one has hard coded parameters. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that 3rd is much more interpretable than the 4th heuristic. Comparing (2nd worst) vs (worst), we see the importance of including perfect fit bonus. Overall: more parameters with adaptive thresholds, bonus and penalties leads to better heuristics, also making the heuristic more interpretable is important.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, include several factors, but avoid over-constraining it with hardcoded parameters. Adaptive thresholds and tunable weights for different factors are beneficial. Aim for interpretable code. Add random components to explore diverse solutions.
