**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see 1st uses a heliocentric model analogy, prioritizing bins closer in capacity to the item, while 20th prioritizes minimizing wasted space directly and uses a random factor. 1st normalizes differences and scales priority based on percentage filled, while 20th squares the remaining capacity.

Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), 2nd prioritizes bins with the smallest remaining capacity after packing and uses Newton's law of cooling analogy, while 19th prioritizes bins that can fit the item snugly by squaring the remaining space and adds a random factor. 2nd adds a bias to partially filled bins, and sets infeasible bins to negative infinity while 19th returns the bin capacities directly

Comparing (3rd) vs (18th), 3rd calculates fullness scores and prioritizes viable bins, discouraging almost-full bins, while 18th prioritizes bins that fit snugly, squaring the wasted space and adding a random factor. 3rd uses np.where to assign priorities and handles potential division by zero, while 18th returns bin capacities if no bins fit.

Comparing (4th) vs (17th), 4th incorporates feasibility checks, capacity utilization with exponential preference, and fragmentation avoidance, while 17th considers waste, fill level, and avoidance of near-full bins, normalizing waste and using exponentials for fill level priority. 4th penalizes fragmentation only if enough feasible bins exist. 17th uses a combination of normalized waste, fill level priority and fullness penalty, with weighting.

Comparing (5th) vs (16th), 5th duplicates the code from the 4th heuristic, which may be problematic since duplicate functions are redundant. 16th prioritizes bins that are "almost full" after adding item but penalize near-perfect fits and penalize bins that would have too little remaining space.

Comparing (6th) vs (15th), 6th calculates wasted space and adds a bonus for relatively full bins using a logarithm while 15th prioritizes bins large enough to accomodate item, prioritize "almost full" bins and penalize near-perfect fits and bins that would have too little remaining space.

Comparing (7th) vs (14th), 7th and 14th both include relativistic near-overflow penalization, however 7th has a perfect fit huge boost, while 14th has Space-Time Curvature Analogy, Principle of Least Action and Avoid Extreme Packing Densities

Comparing (8th) vs (13th), 8th prioritizes bins with smaller wasted space and gives higher priority to almost full bins after adding item while 13th also includes relativistic near-overflow penalization and Avoid Extreme Packing Densities

Comparing (9th) vs (12th), 9th duplicates the code from the 5th heuristic, which may be problematic since duplicate functions are redundant. 12th has Remaining capacity after packing relative to original capacity

Comparing (10th) vs (11th), 10th includes a perfect fit huge boost, while 11th has Remaining capacity after packing relative to original capacity

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see 11th has Remaining capacity after packing relative to original capacity whereas 12th duplicates the code from the 11th heuristic, which may be problematic since duplicate functions are redundant.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate feasibility checks, capacity utilization, and fragmentation avoidance, often using mathematical functions like exponentials and logarithms to prioritize near-full bins while penalizing excessive waste or near-overflows. The best approaches also incorporate scaling factors or biases to encourage complete filling and avoid creating bins that can only hold very small items. Poorer performing heuristics have less sophisticated logic that do not account for edge cases and duplicate code.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider feasibility, capacity utilization, and fragmentation. Use mathematical functions to model priorities, penalize undesirable outcomes, and add scaling factors to encourage complete filling. Regularly review and eliminate redundant code.
