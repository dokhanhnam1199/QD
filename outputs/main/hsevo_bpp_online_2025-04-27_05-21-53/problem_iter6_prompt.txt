Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Ensure interpretability.\n*   **Avoid:** Rigid, hardcoded parameters; redundant code; focusing solely on single objectives.\n*   **Explanation:** Design heuristics that dynamically adjust to problem characteristics, actively explore the solution space, and are easily understood and maintained.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
