
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to boost heuristic design:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, dynamic, balanced exploration/exploitation, diversity, tunable weights, interpretable, random components.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that adapt to problem characteristics (item sizes, bin fill levels). Use tunable weights to balance competing objectives (feasibility, utilization, fragmentation). Incorporate randomness for exploration.

*   **Avoid:** Hardcoded parameters, premature convergence, redundancy.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on adaptability and balanced strategies. Employ tunable parameters for flexibility and interpretability. Prioritize exploration to avoid local optima while ensuring efficient resource utilization.
