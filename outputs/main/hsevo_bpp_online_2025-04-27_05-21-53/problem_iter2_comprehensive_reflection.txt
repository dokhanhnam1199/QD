
Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more effective for heuristic design, focusing on avoiding pitfalls and leading to better heuristics.

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive Learning, Outcome Analysis, Solution Diversity, Algorithmic Bias.
*   **Advice:** Analyze heuristic *performance* across diverse problem instances and parameter settings. Quantify solution *quality*, not just feasibility. Explicitly track *algorithmic bias* and design heuristics to mitigate it. Explore diverse solution pathways and avoid premature convergence.
*   **Avoid:** Focusing solely on mathematical models without empirical validation. Ignoring the impact of parameter tuning on heuristic performance. Neglecting the exploration of alternative solution generation strategies.
*   **Explanation:** Shift from static rules to adaptive learning from results. Validate and prevent bias. Aim for more diverse and better solutions.
