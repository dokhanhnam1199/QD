{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nAdapt heuristics to item sizes, and dynamically adjust exploration based on average bin fill levels. Penalize near-perfect fits, reward moderate fits, and discourage small remainders.\nConsider both exploration of less-utilized bins and exploitation of almost-full bins and add diversity to avoid premature convergence.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider feasibility, capacity utilization, and fragmentation. Use mathematical functions to model priorities, penalize undesirable outcomes, and add scaling factors to encourage complete filling. Regularly review and eliminate redundant code.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, include several factors, but avoid over-constraining it with hardcoded parameters. Adaptive thresholds and tunable weights for different factors are beneficial. Aim for interpretable code. Add random components to explore diverse solutions.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
