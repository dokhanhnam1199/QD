Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective in designing better heuristics, steering clear of the pitfalls in "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Deliberate Design, Adaptive Strategy, Edge-Case Focus, Performance Feedback.
*   **Advice:** Focus on the *intentional* design of heuristics, emphasizing adaptability and precise handling of edge cases, incorporating a feedback loop based on performance metrics.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex methods without clear benefit, generic "consider multiple factors," and simply stating "balancing exploration/exploitation" without specific implementation details.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of vague suggestions, emphasize creating a planful approach, tailoring heuristics to specific problem features, and continuously refining the approach based on observed performance.
