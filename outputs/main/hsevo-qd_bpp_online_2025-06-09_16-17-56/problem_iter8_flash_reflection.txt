**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the inclusion of more sophisticated heuristics like "almost full," "balanced bin," and "small item" preferences, along with tunable parameters and random factors, contributes to better performance. Conversely, (20th) relies solely on a logarithmic ratio, lacking nuanced considerations.

Comparing (6th) vs (10th), (6th) has almost_full_threshold, almost_full_boost, small_item_threshold, random_factor are hard code while (10th) has almost_full_threshold, random_factor are hard code, so (6th) is better than (10th).

Comparing (1st) vs (6th), we see that (1st) use many parameters while (6th) do not, this make (1st) better than (6th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (2nd) vs (3rd), (3rd) vs (4th), (4th) vs (5th), all the same so no difference here. Comparing (6th) vs (7th), (7th) vs (8th), (8th) vs (9th), all the same so no difference here. Comparing (10th) vs (11th), (11th) vs (12th), (12th) vs (13th), (13th) vs (14th), (14th) vs (15th), all the same so no difference here. Comparing (17th) vs (18th), (18th) vs (19th), all the same so no difference here.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that (16th) use  capacity ratio for bin priority while (20th) is not, so (16th) is better. Overall: Using more tunable parameters, and adding more heuristic algorithm like "almost full," "balanced bin," and "small item" contribute to better performance.

**Experience:**
Employ diverse, complementary heuristics with tunable parameters to adapt to varying problem instances. Randomization aids exploration, while specialized rules (e.g., for small items) address edge cases, improving overall solution quality.
