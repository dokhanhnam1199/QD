Okay, here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection" focused on actionable insights for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Rigorous Analysis, Adaptive Strategy, Edge Case Mastery, Penalties/Constraints.

*   **Advice:** Instead of just *considering* factors, *quantify* their impact through rigorous analysis. Dynamically adjust tunable parameters based on real-time performance feedback (adaptive strategy). Prioritize robust edge case handling, not just consideration.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex solutions *without* demonstrable benefit. General statements about "balancing" without specifics.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond vague advice. Emphasize measurable impact and data-driven adaptation, not just generic statements about complexity or balance.
