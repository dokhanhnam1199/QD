**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach, combining wasted space minimization, filling almost-full bins, and a small amount of randomization, while the last only calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity. The better heuristic considers several factors, while the worse relies on only one.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), there is no difference.
Comparing (10th) vs (11th), the former uses a complex heuristics that takes into account wasted space, almost full thresholds, and a small random factor, while the latter simply uses the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. The first one is much more sophisticated, while the second one only looks at the ratios.
Overall: The better heuristics are complex, incorporating multiple factors, including wasted space, fragmentation avoidance, and randomization. The worse heuristics rely on a single ratio calculation. Better heuristics seem to balance exploration (randomization) and exploitation (filling nearly full bins and minimizing wasted space) more effectively. The "almost_full_threshold" parameter in the better heuristics enables tuning for different scenarios.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors that influence the desired outcome. Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial. Allow for tunable parameters to adapt to varying problem characteristics. Favor more complex methods.
