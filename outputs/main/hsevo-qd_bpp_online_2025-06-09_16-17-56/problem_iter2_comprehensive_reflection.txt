Okay, I understand. Let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a redefined "Current Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Rigorous Evaluation, Adaptive Learning, Problem Structure, Computational Cost.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize empirical testing across diverse instances. Design heuristics that learn and adapt from previous performance. Leverage understanding of the problem's underlying structure.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on complexity without demonstrable benefit. Neglecting computational cost analysis.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on evidence-based improvements. Adapt heuristics based on performance feedback. Complex solutions can be inefficient if not well-suited to the problem structure and constraints.
