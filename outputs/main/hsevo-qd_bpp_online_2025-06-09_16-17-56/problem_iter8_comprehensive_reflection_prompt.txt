{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEmploy diverse, complementary heuristics with tunable parameters to adapt to varying problem instances. Randomization aids exploration, while specialized rules (e.g., for small items) address edge cases, improving overall solution quality.\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, use tunable parameters to adapt to different scenarios, and carefully handle edge cases. Adding penalties for invalid solutions improves performance. Balance exploration (randomness) with exploitation (greedy choices).\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple factors that influence the desired outcome. Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial. Allow for tunable parameters to adapt to varying problem characteristics. Favor more complex methods.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
