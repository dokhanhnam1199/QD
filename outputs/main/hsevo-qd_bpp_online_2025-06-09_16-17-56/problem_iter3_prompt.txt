Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Heuristic 1: First Fit Decreasing (FFD) inspired - prefer bins with enough space, penalized by wasted space.\n    # Bins that cannot fit the item get a very low priority.\n\n    for i, cap in enumerate(bins_remain_cap):\n        if cap >= item:\n            #Calculate the wasted space.

Let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Rigorous Evaluation, Adaptive Learning, Problem Structure, Computational Cost.\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize empirical testing across diverse instances. Design heuristics that learn and adapt from previous performance. Leverage understanding of the problem's underlying structure.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on complexity without demonstrable benefit. Neglecting computational cost analysis.\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on evidence-based improvements. Adapt heuristics based on performance feedback. Complex solutions can be inefficient if not well-suited to the problem structure and constraints.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
