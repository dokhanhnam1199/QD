**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first heuristic incorporates several tunable parameters (almost_full_threshold, almost_full_boost, random_factor, not_fit_penalty), while the last one uses a simple logarithmic ratio. Also, the first one utilizes several heuristics to improve performance while the last one only uses one. (2nd) vs (19th) follows a similar pattern. (3rd) vs (18th), and (4th) vs (17th) also show that the better heuristics include more parameters. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first one uses tunable parameters instead of hardcoded values. Also, the first one has a not_fit_penalty that is much larger than the one in the second one. (10th) vs (11th) shows that the better heuristic has more sophisticated consideration about small items. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst is much better as it implements a penalty when items don't fit. Overall: Better heuristics consider more factors, use tunable parameters, and handle edge cases more effectively.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, use tunable parameters to adapt to different scenarios, and carefully handle edge cases. Adding penalties for invalid solutions improves performance. Balance exploration (randomness) with exploitation (greedy choices).
