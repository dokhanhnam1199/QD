Prioritize fill ratio, reward tight fits, penalize large waste, and handle infeasibility gracefully.

Directly using remaining capacity (reciprocal) and rewarding/penalizing near-exact/full bins improves packing. Handling infeasibility is crucial.

Feasibility is key. Prioritize higher fill rates and near-exact fits. Avoid fragmentation penalties.

Prioritize feasibility, near-exact fits, and balance fill percentage with remaining capacity. Avoid unnecessary normalization.

Focus on normalized remaining capacity, exact fits, and handling infeasibility differently. Prioritize feasible bins primarily.

Favor tight fits, penalize waste, and handle infeasibility gracefully. Reward bins that become full.

Focus on remaining capacity after placement and strongly reward near-exact fits, while penalizing near-full bins gently.

Focus on fill percentage, remaining capacity normalization, and feasibility for robust bin selection.

Prioritize feasibility. Focus on tight fits, penalize waste non-linearly, and handle infeasibility gracefully.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize wasted space, and handle infeasibility gracefully for better bin packing.
