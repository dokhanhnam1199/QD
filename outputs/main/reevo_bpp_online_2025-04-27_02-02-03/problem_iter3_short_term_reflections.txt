Focus on fill percentage and remaining capacity. Normalize and combine heuristics for better performance.

Better code uses combined, normalized scores favoring bins closely matching item size while penalizing infeasibility.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize remaining capacity, and maximize fill percentage for online bin packing.

Prioritize relative waste. Use scaled utilization boosts instead of fixed penalties/bonuses.

Better heuristics:
1. Prioritize snug fits using ratios.
2. Strongly penalize bins that don't fit.

Prioritize feasibility, minimize remaining capacity, and maximize fill percentage after item placement.

The better code normalizes wasted space and prioritizes almost-full bins, penalizing small remaining capacities for refinement.

The better code uses fill ratio and penalizes wasted space, promoting snug fits. Negative priority avoids unfit bins.

The improved code uses proportional priorities, penalizes non-fitting bins and prefers almost-full bins, enhancing bin utilization.

Prioritize relative waste (utilization) over absolute waste. Avoid explicit loops and penalties.
