Focus on best-fit, penalize near-full bins more effectively, and reward exact fits sharply.

Favor best-fit, avoid near-full bins, and use precise exact-fit detection with appropriate boosting/penalization.

Prioritize exact fits strongly, penalize wasted space, and discourage near-full bins for better packing.

Prioritize tight fits, reward exact fits, penalize near-full bins, and handle infeasibility gracefully.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize waste non-linearly, and use normalization to guide bin selection effectively.

Prioritize tight fits non-linearly. Penalize waste less severely. Add gentle near-full bin penalization.

Favor tight fits, penalize near-full bins. Normalize only when no eligible bin exists.

Prioritize exact fits, penalize waste exponentially, and gently discourage near-full bins for better packing.

Prioritize fill percentage, penalize excessive waste. Normalize remaining capacity for tighter fits.

The better code emphasizes exact fits, penalizes wasted space non-linearly, and normalizes priorities effectively.
