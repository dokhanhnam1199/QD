Prioritize feasible bins; strongly favor best-fit; penalize near-full bins less harshly.

Prioritize feasibility. Normalize waste. Reward best fit and near-full bins. Penalize excessive fragmentation gently.

The better code uses fill ratio, tight fit rewards, and near-full penalties for improved bin utilization.

Prioritize tight fits, reward near-exact fits, and penalize near-full bins *after* packing.

Focus on feasibility first, then prioritize fill percentage and normalized remaining capacity. Reward nearly-full bins.

The better code uses fill percentage and near-exact fit bonus, and avoids explicit fragmentation penalties.

The better code prioritizes fill percentage and near-exact fits using normalized remaining capacity and avoids penalties.

The better code prioritizes tight fits and full bins, while penalizing waste and normalizing when no fit exists.

Better code: Focus on normalized fill ratio, tight fits, and penalizing waste with dynamic thresholds.

Focus on utilization, feasibility, and directly rewarding higher fill percentages. Avoid penalties and complex normalizations.
