Focus on relative waste, bin utilization near max capacity, and avoid tiny remainders.

Focus on feasibility, wasted space normalization, and rewarding/penalizing specific waste thresholds.

Focus on utilization rate and avoid scaling/multiplicative boosts. Directly prioritize higher fill percentage for eligible bins.

Focus on feasibility first, then prioritize bins based on fill percentage relative to remaining capacity.

Feasibility check is crucial. Combine fill percentage with remaining capacity for better bin selection.

Prioritize tight fits using ratios. Heavily penalize infeasible bins based on wasted space.

Negative infeasibility scores, direct utilization prioritization, and fit bonuses improve bin packing heuristics.

Feasibility first, normalized metrics, and combined heuristics improve bin packing decisions.

Prioritize tighter fits and penalize near-full bins. Use direct reciprocals of remaining capacity for scoring.

The better code uses best-fit, fragmentation control, and feasibility focus, offering insights for heuristic design.
