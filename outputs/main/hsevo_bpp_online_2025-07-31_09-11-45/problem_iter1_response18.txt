Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin for a given item, so that the bin with the highest score gets the item. Let's think about different strategies that could work well.

The first version, priority_v1, just returns zeros. That's a placeholder. For v2, I need something smarter. Let's recall common heuristics for bin packing. The Best Fit algorithm places an item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space after placement. So maybe the priority could be based on how well the item fits into the bin's remaining capacity.

But wait, the priority function needs to return a score for each bin. Bins that can't fit the item (remaining capacity < item size) should have a very low priority, maybe negative infinity so they're ignored. For bins that can fit the item, the priority should be higher the better the fit.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a combination of factors. For example, not just the remaining space after placing the item, but also how full the bin would be. Or perhaps consider the current utilization of the bin. Another idea is to prioritize bins that, when filled with the item, leave a capacity that's a multiple of a certain value, which could help in future packing.

Wait, another approach is the "Worst Fit" heuristic, which places the item in the bin with the most free space, to avoid creating very small gaps. But that's the opposite of Best Fit. So depending on the strategy, the priority function changes.

But since the problem is online, we need to make decisions as items come. Best Fit tends to perform better in many cases. So for priority_v2, perhaps the priority is the remaining capacity after placing the item, but only for bins that can fit it. So for each bin, if the bin's remaining capacity is >= item, then the priority is (remaining_cap - item). The higher this value, the more space is left. Wait, no. Best Fit would choose the bin where (remaining_cap - item) is smallest but non-negative. So the priority should be higher for bins where (remaining_cap - item) is smallest. So maybe the priority is 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) for bins that can fit the item. That way, the bin with the smallest remaining space after adding the item gets the highest priority.

But how to handle bins that can't fit the item. We can set their priority to -infinity so they are not selected. So the steps would be:

1. Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item for each bin: new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item.
2. For bins where new_remain >=0, compute a score that is higher when new_remain is smaller (since Best Fit prefers that).
3. For bins where new_remain <0, assign a very low priority.

So the priority could be (1 / (new_remain + 1e-9)) for valid bins, and -inf otherwise. But adding 1e-9 avoids division by zero. Alternatively, maybe use negative new_remain, so that higher values (closer to zero) are better. Wait, if new_remain is the remaining space after placing the item, then for Best Fit, we want the smallest new_remain. So the priority could be -new_remain. That way, the bin with the smallest new_remain (i.e., the tightest fit) has the highest priority (since -new_remain is largest when new_remain is smallest). But for bins that can't fit, new_remain is negative, so their priority would be positive, which is bad. Wait, no. Let's see:

If a bin can't fit the item, bins_remain_cap - item is negative. So new_remain is negative. So for those bins, we need to set their priority to a very low value. So first, create a mask where bins_remain_cap >= item. For those bins, compute the priority as - (bins_remain_cap - item). Because if the remaining space after adding the item is small, then - (remaining) is a large negative number. Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose after adding the item, the remaining space is 0. Then the priority is 0. If remaining is 0.1, priority is -0.1. So the bin with 0 remaining would have higher priority (0) than the one with 0.1 (which is -0.1). Wait, but in that case, the priority for the bin that exactly fits the item (remaining 0) would be 0, and another bin that has 0.1 remaining would have -0.1. So the highest priority is 0. So that would work. But how to handle the bins that can't fit. So the priority for those is set to -infinity.

Wait, but in code, how to do that. Let's think:

We can compute the possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item. Then, for each bin, if possible_remain >=0, then the priority is -possible_remain (so that smaller possible_remain gives higher priority). For bins where possible_remain <0, set priority to -inf.

So the code would be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
priority = np.where(possible_remain >=0, -possible_remain, -np.inf)

But wait, in this case, the bin with the smallest possible_remain (i.e., the tightest fit) would have the highest priority. For example, if possible_remain is 0, priority is 0. If possible_remain is 0.1, priority is -0.1. So 0 is higher than -0.1, so the bin with 0 remaining is selected. That's exactly the Best Fit approach.

Yes, that makes sense. So this priority function would implement the Best Fit heuristic.

But the user is asking for a creative approach. Maybe combining Best Fit with other factors. For example, considering the current utilization of the bin. Or maybe a hybrid approach.

Alternatively, another heuristic is to prioritize bins that, when filled with the item, leave a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if we track common item sizes, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, the "Almost Full" heuristic: prioritize bins that, after adding the item, are as full as possible. Which is similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item's size, but that might not make sense.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining capacity after adding the item. So for bins that can fit, priority is 1/(possible_remain + epsilon). This way, bins with smaller possible_remain (tighter fit) have higher priority. But this would require handling possible_remain=0, which would be 1/epsilon, a large value. But in code, possible_remain is bins_remain_cap - item. So for bins that can fit, possible_remain >=0. So 1/(possible_remain + 1e-9) would give higher values for smaller possible_remain. Then, for bins that can't fit, set priority to -inf. So the code would be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
priority = np.where(possible_remain >=0, 1/(possible_remain + 1e-9), -np.inf)

This would also implement Best Fit, but using a different scoring mechanism. The bin with the smallest possible_remain would have the highest 1/(possible_remain) value.

But which approach is better? The first approach (using -possible_remain) and the second (using 1/possible_remain) would both prioritize the same bins. However, the second approach might have numerical issues when possible_remain is very small, leading to very large numbers. But in practice, for the purposes of selecting the maximum priority, both methods would result in the same bin being chosen.

But perhaps the first approach is more numerically stable. So the code for priority_v2 could be:

def priority_v2(...):
    possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    return np.where(possible_remain >= 0, -possible_remain, -np.inf)

This would assign higher priority (more positive) to bins where possible_remain is smaller. Because when possible_remain is 0, the score is 0. When possible_remain is 0.1, the score is -0.1. So the maximum score is 0, which corresponds to the bin that exactly fits the item. If there's no such bin, then the bin with the smallest possible_remain (closest to zero) would have the highest priority.

Yes, this would implement the Best Fit heuristic. But the user might want a more creative approach. Maybe combining Best Fit with another factor. For example, considering the current remaining capacity of the bin before adding the item. Or maybe the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item's size.

Wait, another idea: prioritize bins that have a remaining capacity closest to the item's size. Wait, that's exactly what Best Fit does. Because possible_remain is bins_remain_cap - item. So the bin with the smallest possible_remain (>=0) is the one where bins_remain_cap is just enough to fit the item, leaving the least space. So that's Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe a heuristic that combines Best Fit with the current bin's remaining capacity. For example, a bin that is already half-full might be prioritized differently. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the "First Fit" heuristic, which places the item in the first bin that can fit. But that's not based on priority scores. The priority function for First Fit would assign 1 to the first bin that can fit, and 0 or lower to others. But that's not dynamic based on the item.

Alternatively, a hybrid approach. For example, the priority could be a combination of the possible_remain and the current bin's utilization. For example, if a bin is already 80% full, adding an item that fills it to 90% might be better than a bin that's 10% full and adding the item makes it 20% full. So perhaps the priority could be (current_remaining - item) + (current_remaining). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the possible_remain and the current_remaining. But possible_remain is current_remaining - item. So sum would be (current_remaining - item) + current_remaining = 2*current_remaining - item. Not sure if that's useful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the current_remaining after adding the item (possible_remain) plus the current_remaining. So possible_remain + current_remaining = (current_remaining - item) + current_remaining = 2*current_remaining - item. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the current_remaining. For example, if the bin has a lot of space left, maybe we want to leave larger spaces for future items. That's the Worst Fit approach. So the priority would be the possible_remain (current_remaining - item) for bins that can fit. The higher the possible_remain, the higher the priority. So in that case, the code would be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
priority = np.where(possible_remain >=0, possible_remain, -np.inf)

This would implement Worst Fit, where the bin with the most remaining space after adding the item is chosen.

But the user asked for a creative approach. Maybe combining Best Fit and Worst Fit in some way. For example, using a weighted sum. But how?

Alternatively, consider the square of the possible_remain. For Best Fit, we want to minimize possible_remain, so the priority could be - (possible_remain)^2. For Worst Fit, it's possible_remain. But perhaps using a different function.

Alternatively, the priority could be the possible_remain multiplied by the current_remaining. So (current_remaining - item) * current_remaining. For bins that can fit, this would be (possible_remain) * (possible_remain + item). Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the current_remaining. For example, if the bin has a remaining capacity of X, and the item is size S, then the priority is X if X >= S, else -inf. This is the Worst Fit approach.

But the user wants a creative priority function. Let's think of a different approach. For example, the priority could be based on how much the item fills the bin. For example, (item + (current_remaining - item)) / bin_size. Wait, that's (current_remaining) / bin_size. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the item's size and the current_remaining. But that's just the original bin's capacity. Which is fixed, so that's not useful.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the item's size is a large fraction of the remaining capacity. For example, the item's size divided by the remaining capacity. But that's (item / bins_remain_cap) for bins that can fit. So higher values mean the item takes a larger portion of the remaining space. So the priority would be item / bins_remain_cap. But for bins that can fit, bins_remain_cap >= item. So the ratio is between 0 and 1. Bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining space would have higher priority. For example, if a bin has 5 units left and the item is 4, the ratio is 0.8. If another bin has 10 units left and the item is 4, ratio is 0.4. So the first bin would be chosen. This is similar to Best Fit, but perhaps not exactly. Let's see: possible_remain is 5-4=1 in the first case, 10-4=6 in the second. So Best Fit would choose the first bin. The ratio approach would also choose the first bin. So this is another way to implement Best Fit.

So the priority function could be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
mask = possible_remain >=0
priority = np.where(mask, item / bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

But wait, bins_remain_cap could be zero, but since the item is being added, bins_remain_cap must be >= item. Wait, no. Because possible_remain is bins_remain_cap - item. So if possible_remain >=0, then bins_remain_cap >= item. So bins_remain_cap can't be zero unless item is zero, which is not possible. So division is safe.

But in this case, the priority is higher when the item is a larger fraction of the bin's remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has 5 remaining and the item is 4, the ratio is 0.8. If another bin has 4 remaining and the item is 4, the ratio is 1.0. So the second bin would be chosen. Which is correct for Best Fit.

But this approach might not work as well as the previous ones. For example, if a bin has 10 remaining and the item is 5, ratio is 0.5. Another bin has 6 remaining and item is 5, ratio is 0.83. So the second bin is chosen. But possible_remain is 1 in the second case and 5 in the first. So Best Fit would choose the second bin. So this ratio approach also works.

But which is better? It's unclear. But perhaps the first approach (using -possible_remain) is more straightforward and efficient.

But the user wants a creative approach. So maybe combining multiple factors. For example, the priority could be a combination of possible_remain and the current_remaining capacity. For example, possible_remain + current_remaining. But possible_remain is current_remaining - item, so possible_remain + current_remaining = 2*current_remaining - item. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of possible_remain and current_remaining. So (current_remaining - item) * current_remaining. For bins that can fit, this would be (possible_remain) * (possible_remain + item). Hmm. For example, if possible_remain is 0, the product is 0. If possible_remain is 1 and item is 4, then current_remaining is 5, product is 1*5=5. If possible_remain is 5 and item is 4, current_remaining is 9, product is 5*9=45. So the priority would be higher for bins with larger possible_remain, which is the opposite of Best Fit. So this would be similar to Worst Fit.

But that's not helpful. So perhaps this approach isn't useful.

Another idea: prioritize bins that, after adding the item, have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value, say the average item size. But that requires tracking the average, which complicates the priority function.

Alternatively, the priority could be based on the sum of the item's size and the current_remaining. But that's the original bin's capacity, which is fixed. So not useful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the reciprocal of the possible_remain. So 1/(possible_remain + epsilon). For bins that can fit, this would be higher for smaller possible_remain. So this would also implement Best Fit.

But perhaps the user wants a different approach. Let's think of a different heuristic. For example, the "Almost Full" heuristic, which tries to fill bins as much as possible. So the priority is the current_remaining of the bin (before adding the item) minus the item. Wait, that's possible_remain again. So same as Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems that most heuristics boil down to variations of Best Fit or Worst Fit. So perhaps the best approach is to implement Best Fit, which is known to perform well in many cases.

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    # For bins that can fit, priority is -possible_remain (so smaller possible_remain gives higher priority)
    # For others, -infinity
    return np.where(possible_remain >= 0, -possible_remain, -np.inf)

This would assign higher priority to bins where the item fits tightly, implementing Best Fit.

But the user might want a more creative approach. Let's think of another heuristic. For example, the "Best Fit with Look Ahead" heuristic. But since it's online, we can't look ahead. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the "Modified Best Fit" that also considers the current utilization of the bin. For example, the priority is (current_remaining - item) + (current_remaining). But that's 2*current_remaining - item. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the current_remaining after adding the item (possible_remain) multiplied by the current_remaining. So possible_remain * current_remaining. For bins that can fit, this is (current_remaining - item) * current_remaining. For example, if current_remaining is 5 and item is 4, possible_remain is 1, product is 5. If current_remaining is 6 and item is 4, possible_remain is 2, product is 12. So the priority would be higher for the second bin, which is worse in terms of Best Fit. So this would be a different heuristic, perhaps favoring bins with more remaining space. But I'm not sure if that's useful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the square of possible_remain. For Best Fit, we want to minimize possible_remain, so the priority would be -possible_remain^2. For example, possible_remain of 0 gives 0, possible_remain of 1 gives -1, possible_remain of 2 gives -4. So the bin with possible_remain 0 has higher priority. This is similar to the first approach but with a different scaling.

But again, this is just a variation of Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the item's size and the possible_remain. But that's item + (current_remaining - item) = current_remaining. So the priority is current_remaining. Which is the Worst Fit approach.

So perhaps the user wants a different heuristic. Let's think of a different approach. For example, the "Balanced Fit" heuristic, which tries to balance the remaining capacities across bins. But how to model that in a priority function.

Alternatively, the priority could be based on the harmonic mean of the item's size and the possible_remain. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the item's size divided by the possible_remain. For example, item / possible_remain. For possible_remain = 0, this would be infinite. So we can add a small epsilon. So priority = item / (possible_remain + 1e-9). For bins that can fit, possible_remain >=0, so this would be higher when possible_remain is smaller. Which is again Best Fit.

But this is similar to the reciprocal approach.

Hmm. It seems that most approaches are variations of Best Fit. So perhaps the best way is to implement Best Fit as the priority function.

But the user might expect a different approach. Let's think of another way. For example, the priority could be the current_remaining capacity of the bin. So the priority is bins_remain_cap. But then, for the item to fit, bins_remain_cap >= item. So the priority would be bins_remain_cap for bins that can fit. This is the Worst Fit approach, which selects the bin with the most remaining space. So the code would be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
mask = possible_remain >=0
priority = np.where(mask, bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

But this is the Worst Fit heuristic, which is different from Best Fit.

So the user might want to see a different heuristic. For example, combining Best Fit and Worst Fit. But how?

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the Best Fit and Worst Fit priorities. For example:

best_fit_priority = -possible_remain
worst_fit_priority = possible_remain
combined = best_fit_priority + worst_fit_priority

But possible_remain is current_remaining - item. So best_fit_priority is -(current_remaining - item), worst_fit_priority is (current_remaining - item). Sum is zero. Not useful.

Alternatively, weighted sum. For example, 0.7*best_fit_priority + 0.3*worst_fit_priority. But this would require tuning the weights, which is not practical.

Alternatively, the priority could be the possible_remain divided by the current_remaining. So (current_remaining - item) / current_remaining. For bins that can fit, this is (possible_remain) / (possible_remain + item). For example, if possible_remain is 0, this is 0. If possible_remain is 1 and item is 4, this is 1/5=0.2. If possible_remain is 5 and item is 4, this is 5/9≈0.555. So higher values mean the possible_remain is a larger fraction of the original remaining capacity. Not sure if this is useful.

But this approach might prioritize bins where the possible_remain is a larger fraction of the original remaining capacity, which could be a way to leave more space for future items. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the possible_remain multiplied by the item's size. So (current_remaining - item) * item. For bins that can fit, this would be higher for larger items and larger possible_remain. But this might not be useful.

Hmm. It's challenging to think of a completely new heuristic. Given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the Best Fit heuristic as the priority function, which is a solid and well-known approach.

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    # For bins that can accommodate the item, priority is the negative of possible_remain (to prefer tighter fits)
    # For others, set to negative infinity to ignore
    return np.where(possible_remain >= 0, -possible_remain, -np.inf)

This code calculates the possible remaining capacity after adding the item. Bins that can't fit the item get a priority of -infinity. For those that can, the priority is the negative of the possible remaining space, so the bin with the smallest possible_remain (tightest fit) has the highest priority.

This should implement the Best Fit heuristic effectively.

import numpy as np
