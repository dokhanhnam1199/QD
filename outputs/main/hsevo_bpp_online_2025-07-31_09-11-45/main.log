- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

        (1.0 / (remaining_after + 1e-9)) * 0.618 +  # Golden ratio weighting for tight fits
        future_fit * 0.382 +  # Complementary ratio for future flexibility

    # For bins that can't accommodate the item, set priority to cosmic void
    scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, scores, -np.inf)

                         1/(remaining_space + event_horizon) + (bins_remain_cap/(item + event_horizon)),

    # Apply Hawking radiation penalty to near-empty bins

    radiation = np.where(density < 0.2, -10, 1)
    
    return curvature * radiation

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing 1st (quantum-inspired) vs 20th (radioactive decay): The best heuristic combines harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (√capacity) via geometric mean, creating balanced packing/flexibility tradeoffs. The worst uses multiplicative terms (tightness × utilization × decay) that over-penalize mid-range bins.  

2nd (celestial harmony) vs 19th: 2nd's golden ratio weighting (0.618/0.382) between tight fits and future flexibility shows mathematically informed balance, while 19th's exponential decay bonus lacks theoretical grounding and overfits to near-exact matches.  

4th (gravitational) vs 16th (black hole): Both use inverse-square prioritization, but 4th cleanly separates exact fits from others, while 16th introduces unstable density penalties that disrupt ordering.  

13th (exact fit + reciprocal) vs 10th: 13th handles floating-point tolerance properly (np.isclose) and scales priorities appropriately, while 10th's 1e9 boost creates artificial score cliffs.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to redefine 'Current self-reflection' for designing better heuristics, making sure to avoid the ineffective aspects mentioned. The existing effective heuristics include things like balancing tight packing with flexibility, handling floating precision, smooth gradients, multiplicative factors for independence, and using physics/math metaphors.

First, I need to identify what's missing in the current self-reflection. The ineffective part isn't listed, but maybe the current points could be too rigid. For example, using only multiplicative combinations when factors are independent might limit some scenarios where a different combination could work better. Also, relying solely on physics/math metaphors might exclude other useful analogies that are still interpretable.

Next, the advice should build on the current strengths but address potential gaps. Maybe emphasize dynamic adaptation instead of fixed ratios. Also, ensuring that even if factors aren't perfectly independent, there's a way to combine them without forcing multiplication. Testing heuristic robustness under varying conditions could be another point. And while metaphors are good, grounding them in empirical validation would make them more reliable.

Avoiding things like static ratios, over-reliance on independence assumptions, neglecting empirical checks, and forcing metaphors that don't fit. The explanation should tie these together, showing how the new advice leads to more adaptable and robust heuristics without the pitfalls of the old approach.
</think>

**Keywords**: Dynamic adaptation, empirical validation, dimensional synergy, constraint robustness  
**Advice**: 1) Replace fixed ratios with *adaptive thresholds* that evolve with problem scale 2) Test heuristics under *extreme precision edge cases* (e.g., near-zero values) 3) Quantify independence between factors before choosing combination operators 4) Use metaphors only when they enable *actionable geometric intuition*.  
**Avoid**: Static "golden ratios", blind multiplicative blending, assuming dimension independence without proof, poetic analogies without operational mappings.  
**Explanation**: Enhances adaptability through responsive thresholds while maintaining rigor via stress-testing and explicit dependency analysis. Metaphors become tools rather than dogma when tied to verifiable spatial reasoning.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Balances immediate tight packing (item/remaining_ratio) with future 
    flexibility (sqrt residual space), using geometric mean for synergy."""
    
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    # Core efficiency metric: item fills current bin proportion
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)  # +eps prevents div0
    
    # Flexibility metric: sqrt residual space allows mid-sized future items
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + 1e-9)
    
    # Geometric mean creates balanced synergy between competing objectives
    synergy_score = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)
    
    # Precision-aware exact fit bonus (better than ==0 for floating point)
    perfection_bonus = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=1e-8) * 2.0
    
    # Combine components only for valid bins
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score + perfection_bonus, -np.inf)
    
    return scores

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to redefine 'Current self-reflection' for designing better heuristics, making sure to avoid the ineffective aspects mentioned. The existing effective heuristics include things like balancing tight packing with flexibility, handling floating precision, smooth gradients, multiplicative factors for independence, and using physics/math metaphors.

First, I need to identify what's missing in the current self-reflection. The ineffective part isn't listed, but maybe the current points could be too rigid. For example, using only multiplicative combinations when factors are independent might limit some scenarios where a different combination could work better. Also, relying solely on physics/math metaphors might exclude other useful analogies that are still interpretable.

Next, the advice should build on the current strengths but address potential gaps. Maybe emphasize dynamic adaptation instead of fixed ratios. Also, ensuring that even if factors aren't perfectly independent, there's a way to combine them without forcing multiplication. Testing heuristic robustness under varying conditions could be another point. And while metaphors are good, grounding them in empirical validation would make them more reliable.

Avoiding things like static ratios, over-reliance on independence assumptions, neglecting empirical checks, and forcing metaphors that don't fit. The explanation should tie these together, showing how the new advice leads to more adaptable and robust heuristics without the pitfalls of the old approach.
</think>

**Keywords**: Dynamic adaptation, empirical validation, dimensional synergy, constraint robustness  
**Advice**: 1) Replace fixed ratios with *adaptive thresholds* that evolve with problem scale 2) Test heuristics under *extreme precision edge cases* (e.g., near-zero values) 3) Quantify independence between factors before choosing combination operators 4) Use metaphors only when they enable *actionable geometric intuition*.  
**Avoid**: Static "golden ratios", blind multiplicative blending, assuming dimension independence without proof, poetic analogies without operational mappings.  
**Explanation**: Enhances adaptability through responsive thresholds while maintaining rigor via stress-testing and explicit dependency analysis. Metaphors become tools rather than dogma when tied to verifiable spatial reasoning.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

Okay, let's see. I need to extract all the hardcoded variables, thresholds, or weights from the given function and turn them into default parameters. Then create a parameter_ranges dictionary with their possible ranges.

First, looking at the function priority_v2. The parameters item and bins_remain_cap are inputs, so not hardcoded. Now, check for any numbers in the code.

In fill_efficiency, there's a 1e-9 added to the denominator to prevent division by zero. That's a hardcoded epsilon. Let's call that something like eps_fill.

Then in residual_potential, they use np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + 1e-9. The 1e-9 here is another epsilon, maybe eps_residual. Also, the sqrt is applied here. Wait, but the sqrt itself is part of the metric. But the question is about variables, not the operations. So the 1e-9 is a threshold to avoid zero.

Next, perfection_bonus uses atol=1e-8 in np.isclose. That's a tolerance value, so we can name that atol_perfection. The bonus is multiplied by 2.0, which is a weight. So that's perfection_bonus_weight.

So the hardcoded values are:
- 1e-9 in fill_efficiency (eps_fill)
- 1e-9 in residual_potential (eps_residual)
- atol=1e-8 in perfection_bonus (atol_perfection)
- 2.0 multiplier for perfection_bonus (perfection_bonus_weight)

These need to be made into default parameters. So the function signature will have these as keyword arguments with default values.

Now, for the parameter_ranges dictionary. Each key is the parameter name, and the value is a tuple of (start, end) for possible values. The user probably expects reasonable ranges. For example, epsilons like 1e-9 could range from 1e-12 to 1e-6. The perfection_bonus_weight of 2.0 might range from 0.5 to 5.0. The atol_perfection (1e-8) could range from 1e-10 to 1e-5.

So putting it all together:

The modified function will have these parameters added with defaults. Then the parameter_ranges will have entries for each of these variables with their ranges.

Wait, but the problem says "extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable". The sqrt in residual_potential is part of the calculation, not a parameter. So we don't parameterize the sqrt function here. Only the numerical values.

So the code after extraction would have the four parameters: eps_fill, eps_residual, atol_perfection, perfection_bonus_weight.

Then the parameter_ranges would be:

parameter_ranges = {
    'eps_fill': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'eps_residual': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'atol_perfection': (1e-10, 1e-5),
    'perfection_bonus_weight': (0.5, 5.0)
}

I need to make sure that the code replaces the hardcoded values with the parameters. For example, in fill_efficiency, replace 1e-9 with eps_fill. In residual_potential, replace 1e-9 with eps_residual. In np.isclose, replace atol=1e-8 with atol=atol_perfection. And the perfection_bonus multiplies by perfection_bonus_weight instead of 2.0.

So the updated function would look like:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray, eps_fill: float = 1e-9, eps_residual: float = 1e-9, atol_perfection: float = 1e-8, perfection_bonus_weight: float = 2.0) -> np.ndarray:
    ...
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill)
    ...
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + eps_residual)
    ...
    perfection_bonus = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol_perfection) * perfection_bonus_weight
    ...

Then the parameter_ranges as above.

I need to check if there are any other hardcoded values. For example, the sqrt in residual_potential is part of the metric, but maybe the exponent could be a parameter. But the original code doesn't have that as a variable. The problem statement says to extract existing hardcoded variables, not to add new parameters for operations. So we don't include that.

Another check: the function uses sqrt in the synergy_score. But that's part of the calculation, not a parameter. So no.

So the four parameters are the ones identified. Now, code the function with these parameters and create the parameter_ranges dictionary.
</think>

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(
    item: float,
    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,
    eps_fill: float = 1e-9,
    eps_residual: float = 1e-9,
    atol_perfection: float = 1e-8,
    perfection_bonus_weight: float = 2.0
) -> np.ndarray:
    """Balances immediate tight packing (item/remaining_ratio) with future 
    flexibility (sqrt residual space), using geometric mean for synergy."""
    
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill)
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + eps_residual)
    synergy_score = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)
    perfection_bonus = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol_perfection) * perfection_bonus_weight
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score + perfection_bonus, -np.inf)
    
    return scores
```

```python
parameter_ranges = {
    'eps_fill': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'eps_residual': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'atol_perfection': (1e-10, 1e-5),
    'perfection_bonus_weight': (0.5, 5.0)
}

Okay, let's see. I need to extract all the hardcoded variables, thresholds, or weights from the given function and turn them into default parameters. Then create a parameter_ranges dictionary with their possible ranges.

First, looking at the code. The function priority_v2 has a few hardcoded values. Let's go through line by line.

In the line where exact_fit is calculated, there's an atol=1e-9. That's a threshold for the np.isclose function. So that's a parameter to extract. Let's call it exact_fit_atol.

Then in the tightness and utilization calculations, there's 1e-9 added to avoid division by zero. Both lines use 1e-9. So those are two parameters? Wait, tightness uses it in the denominator, and utilization also. But maybe the same value is used for both. So perhaps a single epsilon parameter. But in the code, they both add 1e-9. So maybe we can have a parameter like epsilon=1e-9 for both. But the user might want to separate them. Wait, the code has:

tightness = 1 / (np.abs(remaining_space) + 1e-9)
utilization = 1 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)

So both have 1e-9 added. So maybe two parameters: tightness_epsilon and utilization_epsilon. But perhaps the original code uses the same value. So maybe we can have a single epsilon for both, but the user might have intended them as separate. Hmm. The problem says to extract all hardcode variables. So each occurrence of 1e-9 is a separate variable? Let's check.

In tightness, it's 1e-9. In utilization, same. Then in alignment_bonus, there's another 1e-9 in the denominator: item + 1e-9. So that's a third occurrence. So three different epsilons? Or maybe they can be grouped. But according to the problem statement, each hardcoded variable should be a parameter. So each 1e-9 is a separate parameter. Wait, but in the code, the 1e-9 in tightness and utilization are added to avoid division by zero. The one in alignment_bonus is also to prevent division by zero if item is zero. So perhaps three different parameters: tightness_epsilon, utilization_epsilon, and alignment_epsilon.

But maybe the original code uses the same value for all. So perhaps the parameters are:

- exact_fit_atol (1e-9)
- tightness_epsilon (1e-9)
- utilization_epsilon (1e-9)
- alignment_epsilon (1e-9)
- alignment_bonus_weight (0.15)

Wait, the alignment_bonus is calculated as 0.15 multiplied by the exponential term. So 0.15 is a weight here. So that's another parameter. So the hardcoded variables are:

1. atol=1e-9 in exact_fit (exact_fit_atol)
2. 1e-9 in tightness (tightness_epsilon)
3. 1e-9 in utilization (utilization_epsilon)
4. 0.15 in alignment_bonus (alignment_bonus_weight)
5. 1e-9 in alignment_bonus denominator (alignment_epsilon)

So these are the parameters to extract. Then, the parameter_ranges dictionary should have each of these as keys, with tuples indicating their possible ranges.

Now, the user wants the code to have these as default parameters. So the function definition will have these parameters with default values. Then, the parameter_ranges dictionary will have each key as the parameter name, and the value as a tuple of (min, max) for possible values.

For example, exact_fit_atol could have a range like (1e-10, 1e-8), but the user might not know the exact ranges. The problem says the tuple must include two floats, the begin and end. But how to determine the ranges? Since the user hasn't specified, perhaps we can use reasonable ranges based on typical values. For example, the exact_fit_atol is a tolerance, so maybe between 1e-12 to 1e-6. The epsilon values (like tightness_epsilon) could be similar. The alignment_bonus_weight is 0.15, so maybe between 0.0 to 1.0. The alignment_epsilon (in the denominator) could be similar to the others.

So for each parameter:

- exact_fit_atol: (1e-12, 1e-6)
- tightness_epsilon: (1e-12, 1e-6)
- utilization_epsilon: (1e-12, 1e-6)
- alignment_bonus_weight: (0.0, 1.0)
- alignment_epsilon: (1e-12, 1e-6)

But maybe the alignment_epsilon could have a different range. But given the problem statement, perhaps these are the ranges.

So the code would be modified to include these parameters as keyword arguments with default values. Then, the parameter_ranges dictionary would have these keys with their ranges.

Now, let's write the code.

Original function:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

We need to add the parameters as keyword arguments with default values. So the modified function would have:

def priority_v2(
    item: float,
    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,
    exact_fit_atol: float = 1e-9,
    tightness_epsilon: float = 1e-9,
    utilization_epsilon: float = 1e-9,
    alignment_bonus_weight: float = 0.15,
    alignment_epsilon: float = 1e-9
) -> np.ndarray:

Then, in the code, replace the hardcoded values with these parameters.

For example:

exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_space, 0, atol=exact_fit_atol)

tightness = 1 / (np.abs(remaining_space) + tightness_epsilon)

utilization = 1 / (bins_remain_cap + utilization_epsilon)

alignment_bonus = alignment_bonus_weight * np.exp(-np.abs(remaining_space - item)/(item + alignment_epsilon))

Then, the parameter_ranges would be:

parameter_ranges = {
    'exact_fit_atol': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'tightness_epsilon': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'utilization_epsilon': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'alignment_bonus_weight': (0.0, 1.0),
    'alignment_epsilon': (1e-12, 1e-6)
}

But wait, the alignment_epsilon is added to item. If item is zero, but in the problem statement, item is a float. So perhaps the alignment_epsilon is to prevent division by zero. So the same as others. So the ranges are as above.

So that's the plan. Now, code the modified function and the parameter_ranges.
</think>

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(
    item: float,
    bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray,
    exact_fit_atol: float = 1e-9,
    tightness_epsilon: float = 1e-9,
    utilization_epsilon: float = 1e-9,
    alignment_bonus_weight: float = 0.15,
    alignment_epsilon: float = 1e-9
) -> np.ndarray:
    """Hybrid heuristic: Prioritizes exact fits, combines geometric mean of 
    tightness/utilization from v0 with v1's residual alignment bonus (simplified)."""
    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_space, 0, atol=exact_fit_atol)
    valid = remaining_space >= 0
    
    # Core geometric mean calculation from v0
    tightness = 1 / (np.abs(remaining_space) + tightness_epsilon)
    utilization = 1 / (bins_remain_cap + utilization_epsilon)
    combined_score = np.sqrt(tightness * utilization)
    
    # Simplified residual alignment from v1: Encourage space matching item size
    alignment_bonus = alignment_bonus_weight * np.exp(-np.abs(remaining_space - item)/(item + alignment_epsilon))
    
    priorities = np.where(
        exact_fit,
        np.inf,  # Absolute priority for perfect fits
        np.where(
            valid,
            combined_score + alignment_bonus,  # Balanced core + alignment bonus
            -np.inf  # Exclude invalid bins
        )
    )
    
    return priorities
```

```python
parameter_ranges = {
    'exact_fit_atol': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'tightness_epsilon': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'utilization_epsilon': (1e-12, 1e-6),
    'alignment_bonus_weight': (0.0, 1.0),
    'alignment_epsilon': (1e-12, 1e-6)
}
