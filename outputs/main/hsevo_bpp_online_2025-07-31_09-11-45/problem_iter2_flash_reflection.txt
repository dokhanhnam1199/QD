Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of 20 heuristics ranked from best to worst. My task is to analyze pairs of these heuristics, comparing the better ones with the worse ones, and then extract some general design principles based on that analysis.

First, I need to understand what makes one heuristic better than another. Looking at the top ones, like Heuristics 1st, it uses terms like harmonic packing efficiency and residual capacity potential. The code combines a harmonic term (which would favor tight fits) with a potential term that might look at how much the bin can still take. The use of geometric mean suggests a balanced approach.

Comparing that to the worst ones, like Heuristics 20th, which also uses terms like tightness and utilization but with an exponential decay bonus. However, the utilization factor here is 1 - bins_remain_cap, which might not be as effective. Maybe the combination here is less balanced or introduces elements that don't contribute as effectively.

Looking at another pair, Heuristics 2nd uses celestial harmony principles, balancing tight fits with future flexibility. It includes a perfection bonus for exact fits and a future fit term. In contrast, Heuristics 19th and 20th use exponential decay bonuses but might not account for future item placements as well. The celestial approach might better balance immediate and future packing needs.

Heuristics 3rd focuses on fill ratio and a perfection bonus. It's straightforward but might not consider other factors like bin utilization. Heuristics 4th uses gravitational attraction with inverse square law, which strongly prioritizes tight fits but might not handle bins that could be useful for future items.

The middle-ranked heuristics, like 7th and 8th, combine multiple factors but perhaps in a less optimal way. For example, Heuristics 7th combines tightness and utilization multiplicatively, which might overemphasize certain aspects. The top heuristics use a more nuanced combination, like geometric mean or weighted sums that balance different objectives.

The worst heuristics, like 15th and 16th, use metaphors like black holes but introduce penalties (Hawking radiation) that might not be data-driven. These could be overcomplicating the heuristic without a solid basis in actual packing efficiency.

From this, I can derive that effective heuristics balance multiple factors (tight fit, future flexibility, bin utilization) using mathematically sound combinations (geometric mean, harmonic mean) rather than arbitrary weights or metaphors. They also handle edge cases like exact fits with appropriate boosts without overshadowing other important factors. Simplicity with a focus on proven packing strategies (like Best Fit variations) tends to work better than overly complex or metaphorical approaches.

**Analysis:**  
Comparing 1st (quantum-inspired) vs 20th (radioactive decay): The best heuristic combines harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (√capacity) via geometric mean, creating balanced packing/flexibility tradeoffs. The worst uses multiplicative terms (tightness × utilization × decay) that over-penalize mid-range bins.  

2nd (celestial harmony) vs 19th: 2nd's golden ratio weighting (0.618/0.382) between tight fits and future flexibility shows mathematically informed balance, while 19th's exponential decay bonus lacks theoretical grounding and overfits to near-exact matches.  

4th (gravitational) vs 16th (black hole): Both use inverse-square prioritization, but 4th cleanly separates exact fits from others, while 16th introduces unstable density penalties that disrupt ordering.  

13th (exact fit + reciprocal) vs 10th: 13th handles floating-point tolerance properly (np.isclose) and scales priorities appropriately, while 10th's 1e9 boost creates artificial score cliffs.  

**Experience:**  
Effective heuristics: 1) Balance tight packing with future flexibility using theoretically grounded ratios 2) Handle floating precision rigorously 3) Prefer smooth score gradients over abrupt boosts 4) Combine factors multiplicatively only when they represent independent dimensions 5) Favor interpretable physics/math metaphors over arbitrary biological/cosmic analogies.
