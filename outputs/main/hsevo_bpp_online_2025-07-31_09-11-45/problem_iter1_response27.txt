Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about how Richard Feynman might approach this. He was known for his creative problem-solving and deep understanding of physics, so maybe there's a way to apply some principles from quantum mechanics or optimization here.

First, the goal is to assign a priority score to each bin for a given item. The priority should determine which bin is best to place the item, aiming to minimize the total number of bins used. The existing function, priority_v1, returns all zeros, which isn't helpful. Let's think about better heuristics.

Common bin-packing heuristics include First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, etc. Best Fit places the item in the bin that leaves the least space left. But maybe we can combine different factors to make a smarter heuristic.

Feynman might consider the efficiency of each potential placement. For example, a bin that can exactly fit the item (so remaining capacity is zero) is ideal. Also, bins that have more remaining capacity after placing the item might be better for future items. But how to balance these?

Another angle: the priority could be a combination of how well the item fits now and how much space is left for future items. Maybe a score that rewards bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is as small as possible but non-negative. That's similar to Best Fit.

Wait, but Best Fit can sometimes lead to bins with small gaps that are hard to fill. Maybe we need a heuristic that also considers the current utilization of the bin. For example, a bin that's almost full is good, but maybe also considering the square of the remaining space, as in the "Best Fit Decreasing" heuristic which aims to minimize the sum of squares, leading to more efficient packing.

Alternatively, using a weighted approach where the priority is a function of the remaining capacity after placing the item. Let's say, if the remaining capacity is r = bin_cap - item. We want to maximize the score for the smallest possible r (but r >=0). So for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, the priority is -infinity (or a very low value). Otherwise, the priority could be 1/(r + epsilon) to favor bins where r is small. That's similar to Best Fit.

But maybe we can add another term to the priority function. For example, considering the current remaining capacity of the bin before adding the item. If a bin has more space, maybe it's better to leave larger bins for larger items. So combining both the fit after adding the item and the current state.

Wait, here's an idea: the priority could be the sum of two terms. The first term is how well the item fits into the bin (like 1/(r + 1e-9)), and the second term is the current remaining capacity of the bin. But how to combine them? Maybe a weighted sum. For example, the priority is (1/(r + 1e-9)) + alpha * (current_remaining_capacity). But alpha would need to be a parameter. However, since the function can't have parameters, maybe we can find a way to combine them without parameters.

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of the inverse of the remaining space after placing the item and the current remaining capacity. Wait, that might not make sense. Let's think: if a bin has a current capacity of C, and after placing the item, the remaining is C - item. So the product would be (C - item) * C. But that might not be the right approach.

Another approach inspired by physics: think of the bins as states and the item as a particle. The priority could be analogous to a potential energy, where lower energy (higher priority) is assigned to bins where the item fits well. For example, the energy could be the remaining space after placement. So the priority is the negative of that, so lower remaining space gives higher priority.

But that's similar to Best Fit. Maybe we can use a more nuanced function. For example, using exponential terms. Like exp(-k*(remaining_space)), which would give higher scores to bins with smaller remaining space. The parameter k could be a scaling factor, but since we can't have parameters, maybe set k=1.

Alternatively, use the square of the remaining space. So priority is - (remaining_space)^2. This would penalize larger remaining spaces more, which is similar to the Best Fit Decreasing heuristic.

Wait, but in the online scenario, we don't know future items. So the heuristic has to be based on current information. Let's think of the priority function as follows:

For each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, assign a priority of -infinity (or a very low value). Otherwise, compute a score that combines how tightly the item fits and how much space is left in the bin. For example:

score = (bin_remaining_cap - item)  # remaining after placement. We want this to be as small as possible. So the priority could be 1/(bin_remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) to maximize for the smallest possible value. But that's exactly the Best Fit.

But maybe we can add another component. For instance, the current remaining capacity of the bin. If a bin has a larger remaining capacity, maybe it's better to save it for larger items. So, if after placing the item, the bin's remaining capacity is small, that's good. But also, the current remaining capacity (before placing the item) is high, which might indicate that the bin is underutilized and could be a candidate for filling.

Wait, perhaps the priority should be a combination of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the current remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has a current capacity of 5, and the item is 3, then after placement, remaining is 2. The priority could be (5) * (5 -3) = 5*2=10. But I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, the product of the current capacity and the remaining after placement. Hmm.

Alternatively, the priority could be the current remaining capacity of the bin (before adding the item) multiplied by the inverse of the remaining after adding. So (current_remaining) / (current_remaining - item). But this would be (C) / (C - item). For example, if C is 5 and item is 3, then 5/(2) = 2.5. If another bin has C=4 and item=3, then 4/(1) =4. So the second bin would have higher priority, which is better because it leaves less space. But this approach might prioritize bins that have higher current capacity but can fit the item with less remaining space. But how does this compare to Best Fit?

Alternatively, the priority could be (current_remaining_cap) * (current_remaining_cap - item). For a bin that can fit the item, this would be C*(C - item). For example, if C is 5 and item is 3, then 5*2=10. If C is 4 and item is 3, then 4*1=4. So the first bin would have higher priority, but that's not ideal because the second bin leaves less space. So this approach might not be good.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to focus on the remaining space after placing the item. The Best Fit approach is to choose the bin with the smallest remaining space. So the priority for each bin is (C - item) if C >= item, else -infinity. Then, the bin with the highest (C - item) that is non-negative would be the one with the smallest remaining space. Wait, no: if C - item is smaller, that's better. So the priority should be -(C - item), so that the smallest remaining space has the highest priority (since when you take negative, the smallest becomes the largest in negative terms). For example, if C - item is 2, priority is -2. If it's 1, priority is -1. Then the bin with priority -1 is higher than -2, so the one with smaller remaining space is chosen. So the priority function would be (C - item) if possible, but inverted.

But how to represent that in code. Let's see. For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bin_cap >= item:

    score = (bin_cap - item)  # smaller is better

else:

    score = -infinity

Then, the bin with the smallest score (since we want the smallest remaining) would be selected. But in the priority function, higher scores are better. So to invert, the priority could be 1/(bin_cap - item + epsilon) to make higher values for smaller remaining. But this can lead to division by zero if bin_cap - item is zero. So adding a small epsilon.

Alternatively, the priority is -(bin_cap - item), so that the smallest remaining space has the highest (most positive) priority. For example, if remaining is 1, priority is -1. If remaining is 2, priority is -2. So the bin with remaining 1 has higher priority (-1 > -2). So the maximum of the priorities would be the bin with the smallest remaining.

But in code, for each bin, compute:

if bin_remain_cap >= item:

    priority = - (bin_remain_cap - item)

else:

    priority = -infinity

This way, the bin with the smallest remaining space after placement (i.e., the tightest fit) gets the highest priority. That's exactly the Best Fit heuristic.

But the user wants a more creative approach. So perhaps combining Best Fit with another factor. For example, considering the current remaining capacity of the bin. Maybe we want to prioritize bins that are already more full, as they are closer to being filled. Wait, but the current remaining capacity is bin_remain_cap. If a bin has a current remaining capacity of 5, and the item is 3, then after placing, remaining is 2. Another bin with current remaining 4 and item 3 would have remaining 1. So the second bin is better. But how to factor in the current remaining capacity.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of the remaining after placement and the current remaining. For example, the priority is (current_remaining_cap) - (remaining_after_placement). But current_remaining_cap is the same as (remaining_after_placement + item). So this would be (remaining_after_placement + item) - remaining_after_placement = item. Which is the same for all bins that can fit the item. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. Maybe the priority should be the remaining_after_placement multiplied by the current_remaining_cap. For example, (C - item) * C. For a bin with C=5 and item=3: (5-3)*5=10. For a bin with C=4 and item=3: (4-3)*4=4. So the first bin has higher priority, which is worse because it leaves more space. So this approach is not good.

Alternatively, the priority could be (current_remaining_cap) / (remaining_after_placement + 1e-9). For the first bin: 5/(2) = 2.5. For the second:4/1=4. So the second bin has higher priority, which is correct. This ratio would favor bins where the current remaining is higher but the remaining after placement is lower. Wait, but the current remaining is (remaining_after_placement + item). So this ratio is (remaining_after_placement + item) / (remaining_after_placement). Which is 1 + (item / remaining_after_placement). So higher when remaining_after_placement is smaller. So this ratio would be higher for bins that have smaller remaining_after_placement, which is exactly what we want. So this could be a good priority function.

For example, if a bin can fit the item with 0 remaining, the ratio becomes (item + 0)/0, but we add 1e-9 to avoid division by zero. So (item + 0 + 1e-9) / (0 + 1e-9) ≈ (item)/1e-9, which is a very large number. So that bin would have the highest priority. For a bin that leaves 1 unit, the ratio is (item +1) /1. For a bin that leaves 2 units, (item +2)/2. So if the item is 3, then (3+1)/1=4, (3+2)/2=2.5. So the first bin (leaves 1) has higher priority. So this ratio effectively prioritizes bins that leave less space, but also takes into account the current capacity. Wait, but the current capacity is (remaining_after_placement + item). So this ratio is (remaining_after_placement + item) / remaining_after_placement. Which is 1 + (item / remaining_after_placement). So the larger the item relative to the remaining_after_placement, the higher the ratio. So this would prioritize bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining space. That's a good heuristic.

So the priority function would be:

for each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bin_remain_cap >= item:

    priority = (bin_remain_cap) / (bin_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)

else:

    priority = -infinity

This way, bins that can fit the item and leave less space have higher priority. Let's test with some examples.

Example 1:

item = 3

Bin1: remain_cap =5. After placing, remain=2. So priority =5/(2 +1e-9) ≈2.5.

Bin2: remain_cap=4. After placing, remain=1. priority=4/(1 +1e-9)≈4. So Bin2 is chosen.

Another example:

item=3.

Bin1: remain_cap=3. After placing, remain=0. priority=3/(0 +1e-9) =3e9, which is very high. So this bin is selected.

Another example:

item=2.

Bin1: remain_cap=3. After placing, remain=1. priority=3/1=3.

Bin2: remain_cap=2. After placing, remain=0. priority=2/(0 +1e-9)=2e9. So Bin2 is selected.

This seems to work well. So this priority function would effectively choose the bin that leaves the least space, similar to Best Fit, but with a different scoring mechanism that might be more aggressive in certain cases.

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate remaining capacity after placing the item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Create a mask for valid bins (those that can fit the item)
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    # Initialize priorities to negative infinity
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    # For valid bins, compute the priority score
    valid_bins = valid_mask.nonzero()[0]
    if valid_bins.size > 0:
        # The priority is (current remaining capacity) / (remaining after placement + epsilon)
        # This favors bins where the item fills more of the remaining space
        priorities[valid_bins] = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] / (remaining_after[valid_bins] + 1e-9)
    return priorities

Wait, but in the code, bins_remain_cap is the current remaining capacity. So for each bin, the current remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap[i], and after placing the item, the remaining is bins_remain_cap[i] - item. So the code correctly calculates remaining_after as bins_remain_cap - item.

Then, the valid_mask is where remaining_after >=0.

The priorities array is initialized to -infinity. For valid bins, the priority is (bins_remain_cap) / (remaining_after + 1e-9). Which is exactly the ratio we discussed.

This should work. Let's test with the examples.

Another test case: item=3, bins_remain_cap = [5,4,3]. Then:

remaining_after = [2,1,0]

valid_mask is True for all.

priorities = [5/(2+1e-9), 4/(1+1e-9), 3/(0+1e-9)] ≈ [2.5,4,3e9]. So the third bin (which fits exactly) has the highest priority. Correct.

Another test: item=2, bins_remain_cap = [3,2]. Then:

remaining_after = [1,0]

priorities = [3/1.000000001 ≈3, 2/0.000000001 ≈2e9]. So the second bin is chosen. Correct.

This seems to work. So this priority function effectively implements a heuristic that combines the current remaining capacity and the remaining after placement, favoring bins where the item takes up a larger proportion of the remaining space. This should lead to more efficient packing than the standard Best Fit in some cases.

So the code for priority_v2 is as written above.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Quantum-inspired priority using harmonic packing efficiency and residual capacity potential."""
    # Calculate residual capacity after potential placement
    residual = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Create mask for valid bins that can accommodate the item
    valid_mask = residual >= 0
    
    # Initialize priorities with negative infinity (invalid placement)
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    
    # For valid bins, calculate quantum-inspired priority score
    valid_indices = valid_mask.nonzero()[0]
    if valid_indices.size > 0:
        # Harmonic efficiency term (encourages tight fits)
        harmonic_term = 1 / (residual[valid_indices] + 1e-9)
        
        # Residual potential term (favors bins needing less future energy to fill)
        potential_term = np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap[valid_indices])
        
        # Combine terms using geometric mean for quantum-style optimization
        priorities[valid_indices] = harmonic_term * potential_term
        
    return priorities
```
