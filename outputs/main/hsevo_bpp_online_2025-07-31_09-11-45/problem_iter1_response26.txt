Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used, so we want to pack items efficiently.

First, the existing priority_v1 just returns zeros, which isn't helpful. So for priority_v2, I need a smarter approach. Let's recall common bin packing heuristics. The Best Fit algorithm places an item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space after placement. That's effective because it tries to fill bins as much as possible.

But maybe there's a way to enhance this. Let's consider the remaining capacity after placing the item. For each bin, if the item fits (i.e., bin's remaining capacity >= item size), calculate the remaining space after adding the item. Then, assign a priority based on that. Bins that can't fit the item should have a low priority, maybe negative infinity so they're ignored.

Wait, but how to handle the priority scores. For bins that can accommodate the item, their priority should be higher if the remaining space is smaller. So the priority could be the negative of the remaining space. That way, the bin with the smallest remaining space (most efficient fit) gets the highest priority. But if the item doesn't fit, set the priority to -infinity so those bins are not selected.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item in each bin. That's bins_remain_cap - item.
2. For each bin, check if the remaining capacity after placement is >=0. If not, assign a very low priority (like -np.inf).
3. For bins where it fits, the priority is the negative of the new remaining capacity. So higher (less remaining) is better.

Wait, but in code, how to compute this. Let's see. For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:
    new_remain = bins_remain_cap[i] - item
    priority[i] = -new_remain  # because we want to maximize this (smallest new_remain)
else:
    priority[i] = -np.inf

But in numpy, we can vectorize this. So compute the possible new remaining capacities, then set to -inf where the item doesn't fit.

So:

new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
valid = new_remain >= 0
priority = np.where(valid, -new_remain, -np.inf)

That's the Best Fit approach. But maybe there's a tweak. For example, some heuristics use weighting. Alternatively, maybe prioritize bins that are almost full but not quite. Wait, but Best Fit is already a standard heuristic. Let's confirm: Best Fit selects the bin with the smallest remaining space after placing the item. So yes, the code above would implement that.

So the priority_v2 function would be implementing the Best Fit heuristic. That's a solid approach for online bin packing. Let me code that.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritizes bins using a 'cosmic compression' heuristic inspired by black hole physics.
    
    Combines best-fit strategy with gravitational weighting favoring bins that would
    approach critical density (near-full) after insertion, while penalizing bins that
    would cross the event horizon (overflow)."""
    
    # Calculate remaining space if item were placed in each bin
    post_insert_cap = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Create gravitational weights (exponentially favor near-perfect fits)
    gravitational_weights = np.exp(-10 * np.abs(post_insert_cap))
    
    # Event horizon penalty (infinite negative for overflow bins)
    valid_mask = post_insert_cap >= 0
    priorities = np.where(
        valid_mask,
        (bins_remain_cap / (post_insert_cap + 1e-9)) * gravitational_weights,  # Favor high utilization
        -np.inf  # Singularity penalty (overflow bins get infinite negative priority)
    )
    
    # Apply Hawking radiation correction (allow slight overflow tolerance for quantum fluctuations)
    priorities = np.where(
        np.isclose(post_insert_cap, 0, atol=1e-6),
        priorities * 1.1,  # Small boost for perfect fits
        priorities
    )
    
    return priorities
```
