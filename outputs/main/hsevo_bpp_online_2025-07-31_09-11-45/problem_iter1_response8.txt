Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin for a given item, so that the bin with the highest score gets the item. Let's think about different heuristics that could work better than the trivial version.

First, the existing priority_v1 returns all zeros, which probably just picks the first bin or something. Not useful. So for v2, I need a smarter approach.

In bin packing, common heuristics include Best Fit (put the item in the bin with the least remaining space that can still fit it), First Fit, Worst Fit, etc. But since this is a priority function, maybe the priority should reflect how well the item fits into each bin.

Wait, the priority function needs to return a score for each bin. The bin with the highest score is chosen. So for Best Fit, the priority would be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but only for bins that can fit it. But how to handle bins that can't fit the item? Maybe set their priority to a very low value.

Alternatively, maybe the priority could be a combination of factors. For example, how tightly the item fits, how full the bin would be after adding the item, and maybe some consideration for the bin's current utilization.

Another idea: prioritize bins where adding the item would leave the least remaining space. That's the Best Fit approach. So for each bin, if the remaining capacity is >= item size, compute (remaining_cap - item) as the priority. But we need to assign a high score to bins where this value is smallest. So maybe the priority is 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) to make smaller gaps have higher priority. But for bins that can't fit, their priority would be negative infinity or zero.

Wait, but the function needs to return a priority for each bin, even those that can't fit. So for bins where bins_remain_cap < item, their priority should be set to a very low value (like -infinity) so they are not selected.

So the steps would be:

1. Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item (remaining_cap - item).
2. For bins where this is >=0, the priority is (remaining_cap - item) but inverted (since we want the smallest possible leftover space). So maybe the priority is (1 / (remaining_cap - item + 1e-9)) to make smaller values have higher priority.
3. For bins that can't fit the item, set their priority to -infinity.

But how to implement this in numpy?

Alternatively, use the remaining capacity after placing the item. For bins that can fit, the priority is (remaining_cap - item). But we want to minimize that, so higher priority for lower values. So maybe the priority is -(remaining_cap - item), so higher values (closer to zero) are better.

Wait, but in that case, the priority for a bin that can fit would be (bins_remain_cap - item). If we take the negative, then the largest value (closest to zero) would be the best. For example, if a bin has 5 capacity and the item is 3, then 5-3=2. Another bin has 4 capacity, 4-3=1. The second bin is better. So the priority for the first is -2, the second is -1. Wait, no, because if we use -(remaining_cap - item), then the first bin's priority is -2, the second is -1. The maximum priority is -1, so the second bin is selected. That's correct.

But for bins that can't fit, their (remaining_cap - item) is negative, so the priority would be positive. That's a problem. So we need to set those bins' priority to a very low value.

So the approach would be:

- Compute the possible remaining space after adding the item: possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
- For each bin, if possible_remain >=0, then priority is -possible_remain (so that the smallest possible_remain gives the highest priority)
- Else, set priority to -infinity.

But how to implement this in numpy?

We can create a mask where possible_remain >=0. Then compute the priority as -possible_remain where the mask is true, else -infinity.

So in code:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
mask = possible_remain >= 0
priority = np.where(mask, -possible_remain, -np.inf)

But wait, the Best Fit would choose the bin with the smallest possible_remain. So the priority for those bins is -possible_remain, which would be higher (since possible_remain is small, -possible_remain is a larger number). For example, possible_remain of 1 gives priority -1, possible_remain of 0 gives priority 0. Wait, no. Wait, possible_remain is bins_remain_cap - item. So if the bin has exactly enough space, possible_remain is zero. So the priority would be 0. If possible_remain is 1, priority is -1. So the maximum priority is 0, which is the best. Then next is -1, etc. So the bin with the smallest possible_remain (i.e., the tightest fit) would have the highest priority. That's correct.

But for bins that can't fit, their priority is -infinity, so they are not selected.

So this would implement the Best Fit heuristic.

But the problem is that the function is supposed to return a priority score for each bin. So this approach would work.

But maybe the user wants a different heuristic. For example, maybe a combination of Best Fit and some other factors.

Alternatively, another approach could be to prioritize bins that, when filled with the item, leave a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if the item is placed, the remaining space could be useful for future items. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the current used space plus the item, divided by the bin's capacity. So higher utilization is better. But again, only for bins that can fit.

But that's similar to Best Fit. For example, a bin that after adding the item is 90% full would have higher priority than one that is 50% full.

Wait, but in that case, the priority would be (current_used + item) / bin_capacity. But since bin_capacity is fixed, perhaps the current_used is (original capacity - remaining_cap). So (original_cap - remaining_cap + item) / original_cap. But the original capacity isn't passed into the function. The function only has bins_remain_cap. So unless the original capacity is known, which it's not in the parameters, this approach isn't possible.

Hmm. So maybe the original bin capacity is fixed and known. For example, if all bins have the same capacity, say 1.0, then the remaining capacity is 1.0 - used. But the function's bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So if the original capacity is fixed (like 1.0), then the used space is (1.0 - bins_remain_cap). But the function doesn't have access to the original capacity. So perhaps the priority function can't use that.

So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the way to go here.

Alternatively, another heuristic is the Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining capacity after placement. But that's the opposite of Best Fit. So for Worst Fit, the priority would be (bins_remain_cap - item) where possible, and we select the maximum. But that's usually worse in terms of bin count.

But the user is asking for a priority function. So the example given (priority_v1) returns all zeros, which is not useful. So the answer should be a better heuristic.

So the priority_v2 could implement the Best Fit heuristic. Let's code that.

Wait, but in the code, the function is supposed to return a priority score for each bin. So for each bin, if the bin can fit the item, the priority is -(remaining_cap - item), which is equivalent to (item - remaining_cap). Wait, no. Let's see:

If possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item.

If possible_remain >=0, then priority is -possible_remain. So for a bin that can fit the item, the priority is -(possible_remain). So the smaller possible_remain (i.e., the tighter the fit), the higher the priority (since -1 is higher than -2, etc.). So the maximum priority would be the bin with the smallest possible_remain, which is Best Fit.

Yes. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    mask = possible_remain >= 0
    priority = np.where(mask, -possible_remain, -np.inf)
    return priority

But wait, in numpy, subtracting item from bins_remain_cap is straightforward. Then, create a mask where possible_remain is non-negative. Then, for those bins, the priority is -possible_remain. For others, -infinity. So the bin with the highest priority (max value) is the one with the smallest possible_remain, which is Best Fit.

Yes. So this code would implement the Best Fit heuristic.

But perhaps the user wants a different approach. Let's think of another heuristic.

Another idea: prioritize bins that have a remaining capacity after adding the item that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if the item is 0.3, and after adding it, the remaining capacity is 0.7, which is a multiple of 0.1, but that's not useful. Alternatively, maybe prioritize bins where the remaining capacity is a prime number, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, consider the sum of the item and the used space. For example, if the used space is (original capacity - remaining_cap), then after adding the item, the used space is (original capacity - remaining_cap) + item. But again, original capacity is not known.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after adding the item, but only for bins that can fit. So for those bins, higher remaining capacity is worse. So the priority is (1 / (possible_remain + 1e-9)), which would make bins with smaller possible_remain have higher priority. But that's similar to the previous approach.

Alternatively, the priority could be the reciprocal of the possible_remain. So possible_remain is bins_remain_cap - item. For bins that can fit, priority is 1/(possible_remain + 1e-9) (to avoid division by zero). For others, -infinity. This way, the smaller the possible_remain, the higher the priority. So this would also implement Best Fit.

But in code, that would be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
mask = possible_remain >= 0
priority = np.where(mask, 1/(possible_remain + 1e-9), -np.inf)

But this would give higher priority to bins with smaller possible_remain. For example, possible_remain=0.1 would have priority 10, possible_remain=0.2 would have 5, etc. So the maximum is the smallest possible_remain.

But the previous approach using -possible_remain is simpler and achieves the same ordering. Because when possible_remain is 0.1, the priority is -0.1, which is higher than -0.2. So the maximum of the array would select the bin with the smallest possible_remain.

So both approaches are equivalent in terms of ordering. The difference is the actual values, but since we're selecting the maximum, the order is the same.

So the code for Best Fit would be as I wrote earlier.

But perhaps the user wants a different heuristic. Let's think of another approach.

Another heuristic is the Almost Worst Fit. It places the item into the second most empty bin that can accommodate it. But how to model that with a priority function? That's more complex.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of factors. For example, the priority could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item's size. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity of the bin after adding the item, but only if it's possible. So for bins that can fit, the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item), and we select the smallest. But again, that's Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the current remaining capacity of the bin. For example, if the item can fit, the priority is the remaining capacity. Then, the bin with the largest remaining capacity (after placing the item) would be chosen. That's Worst Fit. Wait, no. Wait, if the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) for bins that can fit, then the bin with the largest (bins_remain_cap - item) would be selected, which is the Worst Fit. Because that leaves the most space remaining. So for Worst Fit, the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) where possible, and we select the maximum.

So for Worst Fit, the code would be:

possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
mask = possible_remain >=0
priority = np.where(mask, possible_remain, -np.inf)

Then, the bin with the highest possible_remain (i.e., the most space left) is chosen. That's Worst Fit.

But the user is asking for a priority function. So depending on the heuristic, the code changes.

But the problem statement says to be creative. So perhaps the user wants a different approach.

Another idea: prioritize bins that, when the item is added, the remaining capacity is closest to the average item size of the remaining items. But since this is online, we don't know future items. So that's not applicable.

Alternatively, use a hybrid approach. For example, prioritize bins where adding the item would make the bin's used space close to a certain threshold, like 0.5. But again, without knowing the original bin capacity, this is tricky.

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of the current remaining capacity and the item size, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another heuristic is the First Fit, which places the item in the first bin that can accommodate it. But how to model that with a priority function. The priority for the first bin that can fit would be higher than others. But since the priority function is applied to all bins, the first bin in the array that can fit would have the highest priority. But how to assign priority scores such that the first applicable bin has the highest score.

For example, the priority could be the index of the bin (but reversed, so earlier bins have higher priority). So for bins that can fit, the priority is (len(bins_remain_cap) - index), so the first bin has the highest priority. For others, -infinity. Then, the first bin that can fit would be selected. That's First Fit.

But how to implement that. For example:

mask = (bins_remain_cap >= item)
priority = np.where(mask, (len(bins_remain_cap) - np.arange(len(bins_remain_cap))), -np.inf)

But this would assign higher priority to earlier bins. So the first bin in the array that can fit the item would have the highest priority. That's First Fit.

But the problem is that the function needs to return a priority array where the highest score is selected. So for First Fit, the first bin that can fit has the highest priority. So the priority could be a reversed index (so first bin has highest priority) multiplied by the mask.

But the user's example is for a priority function. So perhaps the user wants a different heuristic than Best Fit or First Fit.

Alternatively, a heuristic that combines Best Fit with some other consideration. For example, prioritize bins that can fit the item and have the smallest remaining capacity, but also give a bonus to bins that are already more full. For example, the priority could be (current_used + item) / bin_capacity, but again, bin_capacity is not known.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the item size and the used space (which is bin_capacity - remaining_cap). But again, bin_capacity is not known.

Wait, but if all bins have the same capacity, say 1.0, then the used space is 1.0 - bins_remain_cap. So the priority could be (1.0 - bins_remain_cap + item) for bins that can fit. But this is (used + item), which is the total used after adding the item. So higher values are better. So the priority would be (used + item) where possible. But since bins_remain_cap is given, used is (original_cap - bins_remain_cap). If original_cap is 1.0, then used is 1.0 - bins_remain_cap. So the priority would be (1.0 - bins_remain_cap + item) = (1.0 + item - bins_remain_cap). But this is the same as (original_cap + item - bins_remain_cap). But without knowing original_cap, this is not possible.

So perhaps this approach isn't feasible.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is as small as possible, but also give a higher priority to bins that are already more full. For example, the priority could be (current_used) + (item) for bins that can fit. But current_used is (original_cap - bins_remain_cap). Again, original_cap is unknown.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit is the most straightforward and effective heuristic here.

So the code for priority_v2 would implement Best Fit.

But let's think again. The user wants a creative priority function. Maybe there's a better approach.

Another idea: use a scoring function that combines the remaining capacity after adding the item and the square of that value. For example, priority = -(possible_remain) - 0.1 * (possible_remain ** 2). This would give a slight penalty to larger possible_remain values, but I'm not sure if that's useful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the negative of the possible_remain, but with a bonus for bins that are already more full. For example, priority = -(possible_remain) + (original_cap - bins_remain_cap). But again, original_cap is unknown.

Alternatively, if the original capacity is 1.0, then the used space is 1.0 - bins_remain_cap. So the priority could be (used + item) * (1.0 - possible_remain). But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the priority could be the reciprocal of the possible_remain plus the used space. But again, without knowing the original capacity, this is not possible.

So perhaps the Best Fit is the best approach here.

Thus, the code for priority_v2 would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    possible_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    mask = possible_remain >= 0
    priority = np.where(mask, -possible_remain, -np.inf)
    return priority

This implements Best Fit by assigning higher priority to bins with smaller possible_remain (i.e., tighter fit).

But wait, in the code, possible_remain is bins_remain_cap - item. So for a bin that can fit the item, possible_remain is the remaining space after adding the item. The priority is -possible_remain, so the bin with the smallest possible_remain (tightest fit) has the highest priority (since -0.1 is higher than -0.2). Bins that can't fit have priority -inf, so they are ignored.

Yes, this should work.

So the code would be as follows.
</think>

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritize bins where the item fits snugly, leaving minimal wasted space.
       Uses reciprocal of remaining capacity after placement for valid bins,
       with penalty for bins that can't accommodate the item."""
    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after_placement >= 0
    # Use reciprocal to favor smallest remaining space, add epsilon to avoid division by zero
    priorities = np.where(valid_mask, 1/(remaining_after_placement + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return priorities
```
