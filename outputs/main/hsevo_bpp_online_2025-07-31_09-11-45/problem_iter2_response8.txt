<think>
Okay, I need to create a priority function for the online bin packing problem by combining elements from the two provided versions, v0 and v1, while incorporating the analysis and experience mentioned. Let me start by understanding what each version does.

Looking at v0: It prioritizes bins that exactly fit the item first by giving a huge boost (1e9) to those bins. For others that can fit, it uses the inverse remaining capacity (negative remaining space, so smaller leftover gets higher priority). Bins that can't fit get -inf.

v1: Uses np.isclose for exact fit checks with a tolerance, which is better for floating points. It assigns 1e9 to exact fits and for others, uses reciprocal of leftover space plus a small epsilon to avoid division by zero. The scores are initialized to -inf and only valid bins get scores.

The analysis mentions that v13 (which is similar to v1) handles floating-point tolerance properly and scales priorities, while v10's 1e9 boost creates cliffs. Also, effective heuristics combine harmonic efficiency with residual potential, like geometric mean. The better approaches balance tight packing and future flexibility.

So, combining elements from both v0 and v1. Take the exact fit handling with tolerance from v1, and the priority structure from v0 but perhaps adjust the scoring to avoid cliffs. Also, consider using reciprocal or another method for non-exact fits.

Wait, the analysis also mentioned that the best heuristics use harmonic efficiency (like reciprocal) and residual potential (like square root of remaining capacity) via geometric mean. So maybe instead of just -remaining_after, use a combination of reciprocal and another term.

But the user wants to combine v0 and v1. Let's see. v0 uses -remaining_after + 1e9 for exact fits. v1 uses reciprocal for non-exact. The problem with v0's approach is that the 1e9 boost could create a huge gap between exact and others, which might not be ideal if there are multiple exact fits. Wait, but in v0, exact fits are given top priority, which is correct. However, the analysis says that 13th (like v1) handles scaling better. So perhaps use the exact fit with tolerance, then for others, use reciprocal of leftover, but scaled in a way that doesn't create cliffs.

Wait, the analysis says that 10th's 1e9 boost creates artificial cliffs. So maybe instead of adding 1e9, which makes exact fits way higher than others, we can use a more gradual approach. But in the problem, exact fits should be prioritized first. So perhaps the exact fits are given the highest priority, but the rest are ordered by reciprocal or another measure.

So combining the two: use exact fit detection with tolerance (like v1), then for bins that can fit but aren't exact, use reciprocal of leftover. But in v0, the priority is structured such that exact fits are first, then ordered by smallest leftover. But in v0, the priority is -remaining_after (so smaller remaining_after, which is leftover after placing the item, gives higher priority). Wait, remaining_after is bins_remain_cap - item. So if that's zero, exact fit. For others, the priority is -remaining_after, which is equivalent to preferring bins with the smallest remaining space after placing the item. So that's the Best Fit strategy.

But v1 uses reciprocal of leftover, which is similar to Best Fit as well. However, the analysis mentions that combining harmonic efficiency (reciprocal) with residual potential (like sqrt) via geometric mean is better. But the user wants to combine v0 and v1.

Hmm. Let's think. The better code (v0) uses exact fit with a huge boost, then orders by smallest leftover. The worse code (v1) uses exact fit with a boost, then reciprocal. The analysis says that 13th (like v1) handles floating points better but 10th's 1e9 creates cliffs. So perhaps the improved version should use exact fit with tolerance (like v1's np.isclose), then for non-exact, use a combination of reciprocal and something else, or a different scoring.

Wait, the analysis also mentions that the best heuristics use harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) and residual potential (sqrt) via geometric mean. So maybe for non-exact fits, the priority is the geometric mean of reciprocal and sqrt of the remaining capacity. But how to combine that.

Alternatively, perhaps use the reciprocal of the leftover (harmonic) but also consider the bin's remaining capacity after placing the item. Wait, the residual potential might refer to the remaining capacity after placing the item. For example, if a bin has a small remaining capacity after placing the item, that's good (tight fit), but also, if the remaining capacity is such that it can accommodate future items, that's flexibility. But in online BPP, you don't know future items, so maybe residual potential refers to the remaining capacity's potential to fit other items. However, since it's online, you can't know, so the heuristic has to balance tight packing (minimizing leftover) with keeping bins that have more usable space for future items. But that's conflicting.

Alternatively, the geometric mean between the tightness (1/leftover) and the square root of the remaining capacity. Wait, but remaining capacity after placing the item is the leftover. So sqrt(leftover) would be higher for larger leftover, which is worse. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the residual potential could be the remaining capacity of the bin before placing the item. Wait, but the bin's remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap. After placing the item, it's bins_remain_cap - item. So the residual potential could be the remaining capacity after placing the item. But if you have a bin that after placing the item has a small leftover, that's good for tightness, but if it's a larger leftover, maybe it's better for future items. But how to balance.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that combining harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt of capacity) via geometric mean. Wait, maybe the residual potential is the sqrt of the bin's current remaining capacity (before placing the item). But how does that factor in.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's go back to the user's task: combine elements of v0 and v1, using the analysis provided.

The key points from the analysis:

- The best heuristics combine harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt) via geometric mean.

- The worse code (v1) uses reciprocal but with a 1e9 boost which creates cliffs, while the better code (v0) uses exact fit with a boost and then inverse remaining.

But the analysis also says that 13th (like v1) handles floating points properly (using np.isclose) and scales priorities appropriately, while 10th's 1e9 boost creates cliffs.

So, the improved version should:

1. Use exact fit detection with tolerance (like v1's np.isclose).

2. For non-exact fits, use a combination of reciprocal of leftover and another term (like sqrt of remaining capacity) via geometric mean.

But how to structure this.

Alternatively, the analysis says that the best heuristic uses geometric mean of harmonic efficiency and residual potential. So for non-exact fits, the priority could be the geometric mean of (1/leftover) and sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Wait, but bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity before placing the item. Or after placing the item, which is leftover.

Wait, after placing the item, the leftover is bins_remain_cap - item. So the residual potential could be the leftover. But the harmonic efficiency is 1/leftover, and residual potential is sqrt(leftover). But combining these via geometric mean would be sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) ) ) = sqrt(1/sqrt(leftover)) ) = (leftover)^(-1/4). That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the analysis.

Alternatively, the residual potential is the remaining capacity of the bin after placing the item. So, for a bin that after placing the item has a remaining capacity of R, the residual potential is R. The harmonic efficiency is 1/R. But combining them via geometric mean would be sqrt( (1/R) * R ) = 1. That's not helpful. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the residual potential is the remaining capacity of the bin before placing the item. So, bins_remain_cap. Then, after placing the item, the leftover is bins_remain_cap - item. The harmonic efficiency is 1/(leftover), and the residual potential is sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Then the geometric mean would be sqrt( (1/(leftover)) * sqrt(bins_remain_cap) ). But I'm not sure. The analysis says "harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (âˆšcapacity) via geometric mean". So maybe remaining is the leftover, and capacity is the original bin's remaining capacity. So the two terms are 1/(leftover) and sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Then their product is (1/(leftover)) * sqrt(bins_remain_cap), and the geometric mean is the square root of that product. But how does that help.

Alternatively, the residual potential could be the remaining capacity after placing the item. So sqrt(leftover). Then combining with harmonic efficiency (1/leftover) via geometric mean: sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) ) ) = sqrt( (1/leftover) * (leftover)^0.5 ) ) = sqrt( leftover^(-0.5) ) ) = leftover^(-0.25). Not sure if that's useful.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let's think of the code.

The better code (v0) gives exact fits a high priority, then orders by smallest leftover. The worse code (v1) uses reciprocal of leftover. The analysis says that combining harmonic (reciprocal) with sqrt (residual) via geometric mean is better.

So, for non-exact fits, the priority could be (1/leftover) * sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Or maybe (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover). Wait, that would be (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) = 1/sqrt(leftover). Which is the same as reciprocal of sqrt(leftover). But that's different from either.

Alternatively, the geometric mean of 1/leftover and sqrt(bins_remain_cap). So sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(bins_remain_cap) ). But how to compute that.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of the two factors. For example, 0.6*(1/leftover) + 0.4*sqrt(bins_remain_cap), using a weighted sum. But the analysis mentions the best uses geometric mean, which is multiplicative.

But perhaps the key is to combine the two aspects: tightness (1/leftover) and the bin's original remaining capacity (sqrt) to balance between fitting tightly and leaving room for future items.

Wait, the original remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap. After placing the item, the leftover is bins_remain_cap - item. So the bin's original remaining capacity is the capacity before placing the item. But how does that relate to future flexibility. If a bin has a larger original remaining capacity, after placing the item, it's leftover is larger, which could be better for future items. But in online BPP, you don't know future items, so this is a heuristic.

Alternatively, the residual potential could be the remaining capacity after placing the item (leftover), and the sqrt of that. So the priority for non-exact fits is (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) = 1/sqrt(leftover). But that's the same as reciprocal of sqrt(leftover), which prioritizes bins with smaller leftover. Which is similar to Best Fit but with a different scaling.

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of (1/leftover) and sqrt(leftover), which is 1/sqrt(leftover), but that's the same as before.

Hmm. Maybe the analysis is suggesting that combining the two terms (harmonic and residual) via geometric mean gives a better balance between tight packing and flexibility. So for non-exact fits, the priority is the geometric mean of 1/leftover and sqrt(leftover). The geometric mean of a and b is sqrt(a*b). So sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) ) = (leftover)^(-1/4). But that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the residual potential is the bin's original remaining capacity (before placing the item). So, for a bin with higher original remaining capacity, placing the item leaves more room, which could be better. But that's conflicting with tight packing. So combining 1/leftover (tight) with sqrt(bins_remain_cap) (original capacity) via geometric mean.

So the priority would be sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(bins_remain_cap) ). But how to compute that.

Alternatively, the code could use a combination of reciprocal and sqrt terms. For example:

priority = (1 / leftover) * np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap)

But bins_remain_cap is the original remaining capacity. So for a bin that had more space, even after placing the item, this term would be higher. But this might encourage placing items in bins that originally had more space, which could leave more room for future items. But how does that balance with tight packing.

Alternatively, the code could use the product of reciprocal of leftover and the square root of the leftover. But that's (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) = 1/sqrt(leftover), which is the same as reciprocal of the square root. This would prioritize bins with smaller leftover, similar to Best Fit but with a different scaling.

But I'm not sure. Let's look back at the user's examples. The better code (v0) uses exact fit with a boost, then orders by smallest leftover. The worse code (v1) uses exact fit with a boost and reciprocal for others. The analysis says that combining harmonic and residual via geometric mean is better.

So, the improved code should:

- Use exact fit detection with tolerance (like v1's np.isclose).

- For non-exact fits, compute a priority that combines reciprocal of leftover and another term (like sqrt of something) via geometric mean.

But how to implement that.

Alternatively, the code could use the reciprocal of leftover (harmonic) multiplied by the square root of the bin's original remaining capacity (residual potential). So:

score = (1 / leftover) * np.sqrt(bin_cap)

But bin_cap here is the original remaining capacity of the bin (bins_remain_cap). So for a bin that had more space, this term is higher. This would balance between tight packing (1/leftover) and the bin's original capacity (sqrt), which might leave more flexibility.

But how to code this.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate leftover = bins_remain_cap - item.

2. Check which bins can fit the item (leftover >= 0, considering tolerance).

3. Check which bins have exact fit (using np.isclose with tolerance).

4. For bins that can fit but are not exact, compute a score that combines reciprocal of leftover and sqrt of bins_remain_cap.

5. Assign a high priority to exact fits, then use the combined score for others.

But how to handle the priority scores so that exact fits are first, then others ordered by the combined score.

In v0, the priority is set to -remaining_after (which is -leftover) plus 1e9 for exact fits. This ensures exact fits have higher priority, and others are ordered by smallest leftover.

In the improved version, for non-exact fits, the priority could be the product of reciprocal and sqrt, but to avoid numerical issues, we need to handle division by zero (though leftover is >=0, but with tolerance).

Wait, but in the code, leftover is calculated as bins_remain_cap - item. So for bins that can fit, leftover is >=0 (with tolerance). So adding a small epsilon to leftover in the denominator to prevent division by zero.

So, the code steps:

- Compute leftover = bins_remain_cap - item.

- can_fit = leftover >= -1e-9 (using a tolerance).

- exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9).

- For valid bins (can_fit), compute the score as (1 / (leftover + 1e-9)) * np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap).

But why multiply by sqrt(bins_remain_cap)? Because the analysis mentioned residual potential as sqrt(capacity), which could be the original remaining capacity of the bin. This would give higher scores to bins that originally had more space, which might leave more room for future items. But combining with reciprocal of leftover (which prefers smaller leftover) creates a balance between tight packing and flexibility.

Alternatively, the residual potential could be the sqrt of the leftover (after placing the item). So:

score = (1 / (leftover + 1e-9)) * np.sqrt(leftover + 1e-9)

But that would be (1 / x) * sqrt(x) = 1/sqrt(x), which is the same as reciprocal of sqrt(x). This would prioritize bins with smaller leftover, similar to Best Fit but scaled differently.

But the analysis says the best combines harmonic (1/x) and sqrt(x) via geometric mean. The geometric mean of 1/x and sqrt(x) is sqrt( (1/x) * sqrt(x) ) = sqrt( x^(-1) * x^(0.5) ) = sqrt( x^(-0.5) ) = x^(-0.25). So the priority would be x^(-0.25), which is 1 over x^0.25. This would prioritize bins with smaller leftover, but less aggressively than 1/x.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, the code could compute the geometric mean as described. For non-exact fits:

score = 1 / (leftover ** 0.25)

But this might be what the analysis is referring to.

But how to combine this with the exact fit handling.

Putting it all together:

The improved function will:

- Use exact fit detection with np.isclose and a tolerance.

- For bins that can fit but are not exact, compute a score that is the geometric mean of harmonic efficiency (1/leftover) and residual potential (sqrt of leftover), which results in 1/(leftover^0.25).

- Assign a very high priority to exact fits, then use the computed score for others.

But how to code this.

Alternatively, the code could compute the score as (1/(leftover + eps)) ** 0.5 * (sqrt(leftover + eps)) ** 0.5, but that's 1. So that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the analysis's example of combining via geometric mean is between 1/remaining and sqrt(remaining). Wait, remaining here is the leftover after placing the item. So:

geometric_mean = np.sqrt( (1 / (leftover + eps)) * np.sqrt(leftover + eps) )

Which simplifies to ( (1/(leftover+eps)) * (leftover+eps)^0.5 )^0.5 = ( (leftover+eps)^(-1 + 0.5) )^0.5 = ( (leftover+eps)^(-0.5) )^0.5 = (leftover+eps)^(-0.25)

So the score is 1/(leftover+eps)^0.25.

This would prioritize smaller leftover, but less aggressively than 1/leftover.

So, the code for non-exact fits would be:

score = 1 / (leftover + 1e-9) ** 0.25

But how does this compare to the original approaches.

Alternatively, the code could combine reciprocal and sqrt in a different way. For example, using a weighted sum.

But given the analysis says the best uses geometric mean, I'll proceed with that.

So, the code steps:

1. Calculate leftover = bins_remain_cap - item.

2. can_fit = leftover >= -1e-9 (using tolerance).

3. exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9).

4. For bins that can fit:

   a. If exact_fit, assign a high priority (like 1e9).

   b. Else, compute the geometric mean of 1/leftover and sqrt(leftover), which is 1/(leftover^0.25).

5. For bins that can't fit, assign -inf.

But wait, the geometric mean of 1/leftover and sqrt(leftover) is sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(leftover) ) = sqrt( leftover^(-1) * leftover^0.5 ) = sqrt( leftover^(-0.5) ) = leftover^(-0.25). So the score is 1/(leftover^0.25).

But this requires adding a small epsilon to leftover to avoid division by zero and negative exponents.

So, in code:

leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
leftover = np.maximum(leftover, 0)  # Ensure non-negative, but with tolerance?

can_fit = leftover >= -1e-9  # Using a tolerance
exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9)

# For valid bins, compute the score
eps = 1e-9
score = np.where(
    exact_fit,
    1e9,
    1.0 / (leftover + eps) ** 0.25
)
# Set non-fitting bins to -inf
priority = np.where(can_fit, score, -np.inf)

But wait, the can_fit is based on leftover >= -1e-9, which is bins_remain_cap >= item -1e-9. But leftover is bins_remain_cap - item, so can_fit is leftover >= -1e-9. So bins_remain_cap >= item -1e-9. But item is a float, and bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So this allows for a small negative leftover due to floating point errors, but treated as can_fit.

But in the code, leftover is bins_remain_cap - item. So can_fit is (leftover >= -1e-9). Then, for those bins, we compute the score. For exact fits (leftover ~0), assign 1e9. For others, compute 1/(leftover + eps)^0.25.

But this would prioritize exact fits first, then others ordered by 1/(leftover^0.25), which is a balance between tight packing and flexibility.

Alternatively, the analysis mentioned that the best heuristic combines harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt(capacity)) via geometric mean. So maybe the residual potential is the sqrt of the bin's original remaining capacity (bins_remain_cap), not the leftover.

In that case, the geometric mean would be sqrt( (1/leftover) * sqrt(bins_remain_cap) ).

So:

score = np.sqrt( (1.0 / (leftover + eps)) * np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap + eps) )

But this combines the reciprocal of the leftover (harmonic) with the sqrt of the original remaining capacity (residual potential). This way, bins with smaller leftover (tight fit) and larger original capacity (more potential) get higher scores.

But how does this balance. For example, a bin with larger original capacity may have a larger leftover after placing the item, which is worse for tight packing but better for future items. But since we don't know future items, this is a heuristic.

So, the code would be:

leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
can_fit = leftover >= -1e-9
exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9)

eps = 1e-9
harmonic = 1.0 / (leftover + eps)
residual = np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap + eps)
combined_score = np.sqrt(harmonic * residual)

priority = np.where(
    exact_fit,
    1e9,
    combined_score
)
priority = np.where(can_fit, priority, -np.inf)

This combines the two factors. Bins that have a tight fit (high harmonic) and higher original remaining capacity (high residual) get higher scores.

But how to handle cases where leftover is very small but original capacity is small. For example, a bin with original capacity 0.5, item size 0.5. leftover is 0, exact fit. Another bin with original capacity 1.0, item size 0.5. leftover is 0.5. harmonic is 2, residual is sqrt(1.0) =1. combined_score is sqrt(2*1) = sqrt(2) ~1.414. So the exact fit gets 1e9, others ordered by this combined score.

But in this case, the bin with leftover 0.5 (original capacity 1.0) would have a higher score than a bin with leftover 0.25 (original capacity 0.3, item 0.05). Wait, let's see:

Example 1: leftover=0.5, original capacity=1.0.

harmonic = 1/0.5 =2, residual=sqrt(1.0)=1. combined= sqrt(2*1)=1.414.

Example 2: leftover=0.25, original capacity=0.3.

harmonic=1/0.25=4, residual=sqrt(0.3)â‰ˆ0.547. combined= sqrt(4*0.547) = sqrt(2.188)â‰ˆ1.479. So this bin would have higher priority than the first example. So even though the leftover is smaller (0.25 vs 0.5), the original capacity is smaller, but the combined score is higher. This might be desirable because the harmonic term (1/leftover) is higher, indicating a tighter fit, which outweighs the lower residual term.

So this combined score balances tightness and original capacity.

This seems to align with the analysis's point about combining harmonic efficiency and residual potential.

So, putting this all together into code:

The function will:

- Use np.isclose for exact fit detection with tolerance.

- For non-exact fits, compute a combined score as the geometric mean of harmonic efficiency (1/leftover) and residual potential (sqrt of original remaining capacity).

- Assign 1e9 to exact fits, combined score to others that can fit, and -inf to others.

So the code would look like this:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritize exact fits, then balance tight packing (1/leftover) and residual capacity (sqrt) via geometric mean."""
    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
    can_fit = leftover >= -1e-9  # Tolerance for floating point
    exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9)
    
    eps = 1e-9
    harmonic = 1.0 / (leftover + eps)
    residual = np.sqrt(bins_remain_cap + eps)
    combined = np.sqrt(harmonic * residual)
    
    priority = np.where(
        exact_fit,
        1e9,  # Top priority for exact fits
        combined
    )
    priority = np.where(can_fit, priority, -np.inf)
    return priority

This code combines the exact fit handling from v1 (using np.isclose) and the combined scoring from the analysis's best heuristic. The combined score uses the geometric mean of harmonic efficiency (1/leftover) and residual potential (sqrt of original remaining capacity), which balances tight packing with future flexibility. Exact fits are given the highest priority, followed by the combined score for other valid bins. Bins that can't fit are assigned -inf.
