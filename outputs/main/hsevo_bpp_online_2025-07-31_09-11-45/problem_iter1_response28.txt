Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin when a new item arrives, so that the bin with the highest score (and sufficient capacity) gets the item. Let's think about different strategies that could work well.

The first version, priority_v1, just returns zeros. That's not helpful. So for v2, I need a smarter approach. Let's recall common bin packing heuristics. There's the First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, etc. Best Fit chooses the bin that has the least remaining space after placing the item, which minimizes leftover space. But how to translate that into a priority score.

Wait, the priority function needs to return a score for each bin. Bins that can't fit the item (remaining capacity < item size) should have a low priority, maybe negative infinity so they are ignored. For bins that can fit the item, the priority should reflect how good of a fit it is.

Hmm, for Best Fit, the priority would be higher for bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is as small as possible. So the score could be (remaining_cap - item) but inverted. Wait, no. If remaining_cap - item is small, that's good. So maybe the priority is -(remaining_cap - item), so higher values (less remaining space) are better. But we need to handle bins that can't fit the item.

Alternatively, for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, set its priority to -infinity. Otherwise, compute a score that rewards bins where adding the item leaves as little space as possible. So the score for a valid bin would be (bin_remain_cap - item) but we want to minimize that. So maybe the priority is 1/(bin_remain_cap - item + 1e-9) to make smaller remainders have higher priority. But division could lead to very high values if the remainder is almost zero. That might work.

Alternatively, for Best Fit, the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item) but we want to pick the smallest possible, so the priority could be (bin_remain_cap - item) and then we select the minimum. But since the function returns a score where higher is better, maybe the priority is -(bin_remain_cap - item). So the bin with the smallest (bin_remain_cap - item) would have the highest priority.

Wait, let's think. Suppose bin A has remaining capacity 5, item is 3. Then after placing, remaining is 2. Bin B has remaining 4, item 3, remaining 1. So bin B is better. The priority for A would be -(5-3) = -2, for B -(4-3) = -1. Wait, but higher priority is better, so B's priority is -1 which is higher than -2. So the maximum of the priorities would select B. That works. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit. For those that can't, set to -infinity.

But how to implement this. For each bin in bins_remain_cap, check if bin_remain >= item. If yes, compute -(bin_remain - item), else -inf. So the code would be:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But wait, that would make the best fit (smallest remaining space) have the highest score. Because for example, if two bins have remaining 4 and 5, and item is 3. Then their scores are -(4-3)= -1 and -(5-3)=-2. So the first bin (score -1) is better. Wait, but the maximum of -1 and -2 is -1, so that's correct. So this would implement Best Fit.

But maybe there's a better heuristic. For example, considering the remaining capacity after placing the item. Another approach is to prioritize bins that have remaining capacity closest to the item's size. Wait, that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of factors. For example, the priority could be the sum of the remaining capacity after placing the item (to minimize) and some other term. Or perhaps, considering how full the bin would be. For example, the priority could be (item + (current filled capacity of the bin)) which would prefer bins that are more filled. But the filled capacity is (original bin size - remaining cap). Suppose bins are of size B. Then filled is B - remain. So after adding the item, filled becomes B - (remain - item) = B - remain + item. So the filled after is (B - remain) + item. But the priority could be based on that. For example, higher filled after is better. So the priority would be (B - (remain - item)) = B - remain + item. But B is a constant for all bins, so it's equivalent to (item - remain) + B. Since B is the same for all, the priority can be (item - remain). Wait, but that's the same as (item - (bin_remain_cap)). Wait, but for a bin that can fit the item, bin_remain_cap >= item. So (item - bin_remain_cap) is negative. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the filled after is (original capacity - (remain_cap - item)) = original capacity - remain_cap + item. But original capacity is fixed. So the filled after is (item - remain_cap) + original capacity. Since original capacity is the same for all bins, the difference between filled after values is (item - remain_cap). So maximizing (item - remain_cap) is equivalent to maximizing filled after. But item is fixed. So (item - remain_cap) is equivalent to -(remain_cap - item). So again, same as before. So the priority would be (item - remain_cap) for bins that can fit. Which is the same as -(remain_cap - item). So same as the Best Fit approach.

So perhaps the priority_v2 is implementing the Best Fit heuristic. But maybe there's a different approach. Let's think of other heuristics.

Another heuristic is Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining space that can fit the item. So the priority would be (remain_cap - item) for bins that can fit. So the bin with the largest (remain_cap - item) gets the item. So in terms of priority, for valid bins, the score is (remain_cap - item), and others are -inf. Then the highest score is the one with the largest remaining space after placing the item. That's Worst Fit.

But the user is asking for a priority function. So depending on which heuristic we choose, the code changes. The problem is that the user wants a creative approach. So maybe combining multiple factors.

Alternatively, maybe a hybrid approach. For example, prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is a multiple of a certain value, or perhaps the square of the remaining space. Or maybe use a function that balances between Best Fit and some other consideration.

Wait, another idea: consider the remaining capacity after placing the item, but also how much of the bin is already filled. For example, a bin that is almost full except for this item might be better to fill. Or, perhaps, the priority could be the sum of the filled space plus the item. Wait, but that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining space after placing the item. So for a bin that can fit the item, the remaining space is (remain_cap - item). The reciprocal would be 1/(remain_cap - item + epsilon) to avoid division by zero. So the smaller the remaining space, the higher the priority. That's similar to Best Fit but using reciprocal. This might give higher scores to bins that leave very little space.

Another approach: use a weighted combination of the remaining space and the current filled space. For example, priority = (filled_before + item) - 0.5 * (remain_cap - item). But filled_before is (original_cap - remain_cap). So filled_before + item = original_cap - remain_cap + item. Then subtract 0.5*(remain_cap - item). So the total is original_cap - remain_cap + item -0.5 remain_cap + 0.5 item = original_cap + 1.5 item - 1.5 remain_cap. Since original_cap is a constant, the priority is (1.5 item - 1.5 remain_cap). Which is equivalent to 1.5*(item - remain_cap). Which again is similar to the previous approach.

Hmm. Maybe the Best Fit is a solid approach. But perhaps the user wants a different heuristic. Let's think of other possibilities.

What about the Almost Full heuristic? Prioritize bins that, after adding the item, are as full as possible. So the priority is (filled_after) = (original_cap - (remain_cap - item)) = original_cap - remain_cap + item. Since original_cap is fixed, this is equivalent to (item - remain_cap) + original_cap. So again, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the priority is the square of the filled_after. So (filled_after)^2. Which would prioritize bins that are more full, but in a non-linear way. For example, a bin that is 90% full would have a higher score than two bins at 80% each. But how to compute filled_after. filled_after is (original_cap - (remain_cap - item)) = original_cap - remain_cap + item. So the priority would be (original_cap - remain_cap + item) ** 2. But original_cap is a constant, so this is (item - remain_cap + original_cap) ** 2. But since original_cap is fixed, perhaps this is equivalent to (item - remain_cap) plus a constant. But squaring would emphasize larger values. So bins that are filled more would have higher priority. But this might not be better than Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but inverted. So 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9). This way, bins that leave very little space get a very high priority. For example, if a bin after placing the item has 0.1 remaining, the score is 10. If another has 0.2, the score is 5. So the first bin is chosen. This is similar to Best Fit but using reciprocal. Let's code that.

So the code would be:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
scores = np.where(mask, 1/(bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9), -np.inf)

But adding 1e-9 to avoid division by zero. This would make the priority higher for bins that have the smallest remaining space after placing the item. This is another way to implement Best Fit, but using reciprocal. Maybe this is a better approach because it gives a higher weight to bins that are almost filled.

Alternatively, another heuristic could be to prioritize bins where the item fits exactly. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity is exactly equal to the item size, that's the best. So the priority could be a high value (like 1) for exact fits, and then other scores based on remaining space. But that's a specific case.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of the remaining space and the item's size. For example, if the item is large, we might want to place it in a bin that can accommodate it with as little leftover space as possible. But for small items, maybe we want to place them in bins that have more space left to allow for future larger items. But this requires dynamic adjustment based on the item's size, which complicates things.

Another idea: use the sum of the item's size and the current filled space of the bin. For example, priority = (filled_before + item) / bin_capacity. This represents the utilization of the bin after adding the item. Higher utilization is better. So the priority is (filled_before + item) / bin_capacity. Since filled_before is (bin_capacity - remain_cap), this becomes (bin_capacity - remain_cap + item) / bin_capacity. So for bins that can fit the item, the priority is (bin_capacity - remain_cap + item)/bin_capacity. The higher this value, the better. So this is equivalent to (item - (remain_cap - bin_capacity)) / bin_capacity. Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

filled_before = bin_capacity - remain_cap
filled_after = filled_before + item = bin_capacity - remain_cap + item
utilization = filled_after / bin_capacity
So priority is utilization. So for a bin that can fit the item, the utilization is (bin_capacity - remain_cap + item)/bin_capacity. The higher this is, the better. So the priority is this value. For bins that can't fit, priority is -inf.

This approach would prioritize bins that, after adding the item, have the highest utilization. That's a good approach. For example, if a bin has 5 remaining capacity, and the item is 3, then filled_after is (bin_capacity -5 +3) = (bin_capacity -2). Utilization is (bin_capacity -2)/bin_capacity. If another bin has 4 remaining, item is 3, filled_after is (bin_capacity -4 +3) = (bin_capacity -1). Utilization is higher. So this would select the bin with higher utilization, which is better.

But how to get the bin_capacity. Wait, the bins_remain_cap array gives the remaining capacity. The original capacity is the same for all bins. So bin_capacity = bins_remain_cap[i] + filled_before. But filled_before is the original capacity minus the remaining. So original capacity is (filled_before + bins_remain_cap[i]). Wait, no. The original capacity is a fixed value, say, B. So for each bin, the remaining capacity is B - filled_before. So filled_after = filled_before + item. So utilization is (filled_before + item)/B. But filled_before = B - remain_cap. So filled_after = B - remain_cap + item. So utilization is (B - remain_cap + item)/B. Which is (item - (remain_cap - B)) / B. But B is a constant. So the priority is (B - remain_cap + item)/B. But B is the same for all bins, so the priority is (item - remain_cap + B)/B. Which is (item - remain_cap)/B + 1. Since B is fixed, the priority is proportional to (item - remain_cap). Which is the same as the Best Fit approach. So this approach is equivalent to Best Fit when considering the priority as utilization.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is a solid base. But maybe there's a different way to compute the priority.

Another idea: consider the remaining capacity after placing the item, but also the current remaining capacity. For example, a bin that has a lot of space left might be better to leave for larger items. So for the current item, we want to place it in a bin that leaves as little space as possible, but also, if possible, leaves a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if the remaining after placing is a small even number, etc. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that combines Best Fit with a look-ahead. But since it's online, we can't look ahead. So perhaps the priority could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item's size, but that's not helpful.

Wait, another approach: the priority is the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item. So for bins that can fit, priority is -(remain_cap - item). This is exactly the Best Fit approach, as discussed earlier.

So, given all these considerations, perhaps the best approach is to implement the Best Fit heuristic. But the user wants a creative priority function. So maybe combining Best Fit with another factor. For example, the priority could be the sum of the Best Fit score and a term that encourages bins that are already more filled. For example, the filled_before (original_cap - remain_cap) could be a factor. So the priority is (filled_before) + (Best Fit score). But filled_before is (original_cap - remain_cap). So the priority would be (original_cap - remain_cap) + ( -(remain_cap - item) ). Which simplifies to original_cap - remain_cap - remain_cap + item = original_cap + item - 2*remain_cap. Since original_cap is a constant, this is equivalent to (item - 2*remain_cap). But this might not make sense. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 5, and item is 3, then the term is 3 - 10 = -7. Another bin with remaining 4, item 3: 3-8= -5. So the second bin has higher priority. But this might not be better than Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of the filled_before and the Best Fit score. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum. For example, 0.7 * Best Fit score + 0.3 * filled_before. But this requires knowing the original capacity. But the code doesn't have access to the original capacity. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the original capacity is not provided. So we can't compute filled_before unless we know the original capacity. But the function doesn't take the original capacity as an argument. So this approach is not feasible.

Ah, right. The function only has access to the item size and the array of remaining capacities. So the original bin size is not known. Therefore, any heuristic that requires the original bin size can't be implemented. So we have to work with the remaining capacities and the item size.

So, given that, the Best Fit approach is possible. Let's think again. The Best Fit priority is -(remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)
    return scores

But maybe there's a different way. For example, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but inverted. So 1/(remaining_cap - item + epsilon). This would give higher scores to bins with smaller remaining space. Let's code that.

Another idea: use the square of the remaining space after placing the item, but inverted. So 1/( (remaining_cap - item)^2 + epsilon ). This would more aggressively prioritize bins with very little remaining space.

Alternatively, use the negative of the remaining space after placing the item. Which is the same as Best Fit.

But perhaps the user wants a different approach. Let's think of a heuristic that's not Best Fit. For example, the Worst Fit. But in that case, the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit. So the code would be:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, bins_remain_cap - item, -np.inf)

But Worst Fit is known to perform worse in many cases. So maybe not the best choice.

Alternatively, a heuristic that tries to leave bins with remaining capacities that are multiples of the average item size. But since it's online, we don't know future items. So that's not feasible.

Another approach: the priority is the remaining capacity of the bin before placing the item. So for bins that can fit, the priority is bins_remain_cap. This is the Worst Fit, which selects the bin with the largest remaining capacity. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the item size divided by the remaining capacity. For bins that can fit, this is item / bins_remain_cap. This would prioritize bins where the item takes up a larger proportion of the remaining space. For example, if a bin has 5 remaining and item is 3, the ratio is 0.6. Another bin with 4 remaining and item 3: 0.75. So the second bin has higher priority. This is similar to Best Fit, but the ratio approach.

So the code would be:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, item / bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

This way, higher ratios (closer to 1) are better. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity is exactly the item size, the ratio is 1.0, which is the highest possible. This would prioritize bins where the item fills the bin exactly. For other cases, higher ratios are better. This is similar to Best Fit but using a different metric.

This could be a valid approach. Let's see. For example, if two bins have remaining capacities 5 and 4, and the item is 3. The ratios are 3/5=0.6 and 3/4=0.75. The second bin is chosen. Which is the same as Best Fit. But if the item is 2, and bins have remaining 3 and 4. Ratios are 2/3=0.666 and 2/4=0.5. The first bin is chosen. Which is Best Fit (since remaining after is 1 and 2, so first bin is better). So this approach is similar to Best Fit but uses a different calculation. It might have similar performance.

Alternatively, the priority could be the item size divided by (remaining_cap - item + 1). Wait, but that's not clear.

Another idea: the priority is the item size plus the current filled space of the bin. But filled space is (original_cap - remaining_cap), which we don't know. So this is not possible.

Hmm. Given the constraints, perhaps the Best Fit approach is the most straightforward. But the user wants a creative approach. So maybe combining multiple factors. For example, the priority could be the sum of the Best Fit score and a term that encourages bins that are already more filled. But without knowing the original capacity, we can't compute filled space. So that's not possible.

Wait, but the remaining capacity is known. So a bin with a smaller remaining capacity is more filled. So perhaps the priority could be (original_cap - remaining_cap) + item. But original_cap is not known. So this is not possible.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the item size and the inverse of the remaining capacity. For example, item + (1 / (remaining_cap + 1e-9)). But this would prioritize larger items and bins with smaller remaining capacities. But this might not make sense. For example, a large item would have a higher score regardless of the bin's remaining capacity.

Alternatively, the priority could be the item size multiplied by the inverse of the remaining capacity. So (item / (remaining_cap + 1e-9)). This would prioritize placing larger items into bins with smaller remaining capacities, which might help in filling up bins. But this could lead to large items being placed in bins that can barely fit them, leaving other bins with more space for smaller items.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have two bins: bin A has remaining 5, bin B has remaining 4. The item is 3. The priority for A is 3/5=0.6, for B 3/4=0.75. So B is chosen. Which is Best Fit. Another example: item is 2. Bin A has remaining 3, bin B has remaining 4. Priorities are 2/3=0.666 and 0.5. So A is chosen. Which is Best Fit. So this approach is equivalent to the ratio approach mentioned earlier.

So perhaps this is a valid approach. Let's code this.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores = np.where(mask, item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return scores

This way, the priority is higher for bins where the item takes up a larger proportion of the remaining space. This could be a good heuristic.

Alternatively, the priority could be the item size divided by the remaining capacity after placing the item. So (item) / (remaining_cap - item + 1e-9). This would give higher scores to bins where the item uses a larger portion of the remaining space. For example, if a bin has remaining 5, item 3: remaining after is 2. So 3/2 = 1.5. Another bin with remaining 4, item 3: 3/1=3.0. So the second bin has higher priority. This is similar to Best Fit but with a different metric.

But this approach might prioritize items that leave very little space. For example, if a bin has remaining 3.1 and item is 3, the score is 3/0.1 =30. Which is very high. This could be a good approach.

So the code would be:

scores = np.where(mask, item / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9), -np.inf)

This would give higher scores to bins where the item leaves less remaining space. For example, a bin that can fit the item exactly (remaining_cap == item) would have a denominator of 0, but with 1e-9, it's 3/1e-9 which is very large, so highest priority. Bins that leave more space have lower scores.

This is a more aggressive version of Best Fit, heavily favoring bins that can fit the item with almost no space left. This could be effective in reducing fragmentation.

So this is another possible approach. Let's compare:

For Best Fit (priority is -(remaining_cap - item)):

Bin A: remain 5, item 3 → score -2
Bin B: remain 4, item 3 → score -1 → higher priority.

For the ratio approach (item / (remaining_cap - item)):

Bin A: 3/(5-3) = 1.5
Bin B: 3/(4-3) =3 → higher priority.

So both approaches select the same bin. But the ratio approach gives a higher score difference. This could be better in some cases.

Another example: item is 2. Bin A has remain 3, Bin B has remain 4.

Best Fit: A's score is -(3-2) =-1, B's score -(4-2)=-2 → A is chosen.

Ratio approach: A's score 2/(3-2) =2, B's 2/(4-2)=1 → A is chosen.

Same result.

Another example: item is 4. Bin A has remain 5, Bin B has remain 4.5.

Best Fit: A's score -(5-4) =-1, B's -(4.5-4)=-0.5 → B is chosen.

Ratio approach: 4/(5-4) =4, 4/(4.5-4)=8 → B is chosen.

Same result.

So both approaches work similarly. But the ratio approach gives higher scores for tighter fits. This could be a valid heuristic.

So the code for this approach would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Avoid division by zero by adding a small epsilon
    scores = np.where(mask, item / (remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return scores

This way, bins that can fit the item exactly (remaining_after=0) get a very high score. Bins with smaller remaining_after get higher scores. This should prioritize bins where the item fills as much of the remaining space as possible.

This seems like a creative approach that's different from the standard Best Fit. It's a form of Best Fit but uses a different scoring mechanism. This could be effective in online bin packing.

So the final code would implement this ratio-based approach.
