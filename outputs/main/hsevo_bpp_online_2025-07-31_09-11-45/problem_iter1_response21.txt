Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online Bin Packing Problem. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. So, when a new item comes in, we want to place it in a bin that's already open if possible, preferably in a way that leaves the least wasted space.

First, the trivial version returns all zeros, which probably just picks the first bin. Not efficient. For v2, I need a smarter approach. Let me recall common heuristics for bin packing. There's the First Fit, which places the item in the first bin that has enough space. Best Fit puts it in the bin with the least remaining space after placement. But those are more about selection rather than priority scoring.

So, the priority function should assign a score to each bin. The bin with the highest score gets chosen. For Best Fit, the priority would be based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. Wait, but if the bin can't fit the item, the priority should be very low or negative. So first, check if the bin can accommodate the item. If not, set the priority to -infinity or something. For bins that can fit it, calculate a score that reflects how tightly the item fits. Maybe the remaining space after placing the item (bins_remain_cap - item) is minimized. So higher priority for smaller remaining capacity. But since we want higher scores for better fits, maybe the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) but inverted. Wait, no. If remaining capacity after placing the item is small, that's good. So the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) but we want higher values when that difference is smaller. So maybe the priority is 1/(bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9) to avoid division by zero. But that might not be the best approach.

Alternatively, for Best Fit, the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) but only for bins where bins_remain_cap >= item. Then, the bin with the smallest (bins_remain_cap - item) would have the highest priority. But since we need to return a score where higher is better, maybe the priority is -(bins_remain_cap - item). So the largest negative (i.e., smallest remaining space) would be the highest priority. But how to handle bins that can't fit the item. For those, their priority should be very low so they are not selected.

So the steps would be:

1. For each bin, check if bins_remain_cap >= item. If not, assign a very low priority (like -infinity).
2. For bins that can fit, compute a score that is (bins_remain_cap - item). But since we want to minimize this, the priority could be (1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)) to make smaller differences have higher scores. Or maybe (bins_remain_cap - item) is subtracted from a large number. Alternatively, use the negative of (bins_remain_cap - item), so that the smallest difference (like zero) gives the highest priority.

Wait, let's think. Suppose a bin has remaining capacity 5, and the item is 3. Then bins_remain_cap - item is 2. Another bin has remaining capacity 4, item is 3. Then difference is 1. The second bin is better. So if the priority is -(difference), then the second bin has -1, which is higher than -2. So higher priority. So the priority for each bin is (bins_remain_cap - item) if the bin can fit, else -inf. Then, the bin with the smallest (bins_remain_cap - item) would have the highest priority. So the priority score would be (bins_remain_cap - item) but inverted. Wait, no. Because if we take the negative, then the smallest difference (like 0) would have the highest priority. So the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) for bins that can fit, and then we select the bin with the minimum value. But the priority function here is supposed to return a score where higher is better. So to convert the difference into a higher score for smaller differences, perhaps the priority is (1 / (difference + 1e-9)) for bins that can fit. That way, a difference of 0 (exact fit) would have a very high priority. For example, if a bin has remaining capacity exactly equal to the item, then difference is 0, so 1/(0 + 1e-9) is 1e9, which is a high priority. For a difference of 1, it's 1. So the priority would be higher for bins that can fit the item more snugly.

But maybe there's a better way. Another approach is to prioritize bins that, when the item is placed, leave the least remaining space. So the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) for bins where bins_remain_cap >= item. Then, the bin with the smallest (bins_remain_cap - item) is the best. But since the priority function returns a score where higher is better, we need to invert this. So perhaps the priority is (1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)) for valid bins, and -inf otherwise. That way, the smaller the difference, the higher the priority.

Alternatively, we can use the remaining capacity after placing the item. For example, if a bin has 5 remaining, and the item is 3, then after placing, the remaining is 2. The priority could be the remaining capacity after placement. But wait, we want to minimize that. So higher priority for lower remaining. So the priority could be (1 / (remaining_after_placement + 1e-9)), which would be higher when remaining_after_placement is smaller.

So, in code:

For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bin_cap >= item:

    remaining_after = bin_cap - item

    priority = 1.0 / (remaining_after + 1e-9)

else:

    priority = -np.inf

But this would assign a very high priority to bins that exactly fit the item. For example, if a bin has exactly the same remaining capacity as the item, then remaining_after is zero, so 1/(0 + 1e-9) is 1e9. That's a high score. For a bin that has more space, the score is lower. So this would implement the Best Fit heuristic, which selects the bin that leaves the least space after placement.

Another possible heuristic is to consider the utilization. For example, bins that are already more full could be prioritized. But in online scenarios, you don't know future items. So Best Fit is a common approach.

So the priority_v2 function would implement the Best Fit heuristic. Let's code that.

Wait, but the function needs to return a priority score for each bin. So for each bin in bins_remain_cap, compute the score.

In code:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    # Calculate remaining capacity after placing the item
    remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Check if the item fits
    valid = remaining >= 0
    # For valid bins, compute 1/(remaining + epsilon) to prioritize smaller remaining
    # For invalid bins, set to -infinity
    scores = np.where(valid, 1.0 / (remaining + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return scores

But wait, in numpy, division by zero is handled as inf, but here we add 1e-9 to avoid division by zero. So even if remaining is zero, it's 1e-9, so 1e9. That's a high score.

This should work. Let's test with an example. Suppose bins_remain_cap is [5, 4, 3], item is 3. Then:

remaining = [2,1,0]

valid = [True, True, True]

scores = 1/(2+1e-9) ≈ 0.5, 1/(1+1e-9) ≈1, 1/(0+1e-9)=1e9. So the third bin has the highest priority. Correct.

Another example: bins_remain_cap is [2,3,4], item is 3. Then:

remaining for each bin: 2-3=-1 (invalid), 0 (valid), 1 (valid). So valid is [False, True, True]. Scores for valid bins: 1/(0+1e-9) = 1e9, 1/(1+1e-9) ≈1. So the second bin (remaining 0) is selected. Correct.

This should implement the Best Fit heuristic. So the code would look like that.

But maybe there's a better way. For example, some heuristics also consider the current utilization of the bin. For example, if a bin is almost full, but adding the item would make it full, that's good. But in Best Fit, that's already considered.

Another possible variation is to use the sum of the current used space plus the item. But that's similar.

Alternatively, the Worst Fit heuristic, which places the item in the bin with the most remaining space. But that's the opposite. But the user is asking for a better priority function. So Best Fit is a standard approach.

So the code for priority_v2 would be as described.
