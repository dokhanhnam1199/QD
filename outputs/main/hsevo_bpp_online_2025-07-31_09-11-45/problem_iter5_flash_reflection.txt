Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a list of 20 heuristics ranked from best to worst. My task is to analyze them and provide insights based on their code and comments.

First, I need to compare the top ones with the lower-ranked ones. Let's look at the first heuristic. It uses a geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, adds a perfection bonus, and handles valid bins. The second is the same as the first, which is odd. Maybe a duplication. Then the third introduces parameters like eps_fill and perfection_bonus_weight, which might be optimized values. The 4th, 5th, 6th are the same as the 3rd. Then the 7th uses a different approach with tightness and utilization, geometric mean again. The 8th is more complex with dynamic weights and predictive elements. The 9th and 10th use harmonic and residual potential. The 11th is similar to 7th, 12th to 9th. The 13th to 15th add more dynamic elements like adaptive exponents and penalties. The 16th uses exponential decay. The 17th combines tightness and utilization. The 18th-20th have quantum-inspired terms and more complex scoring.

Looking for patterns: The better heuristics (top ones) balance immediate efficiency with future flexibility using geometric mean, have parameters tuned (like eps values), and include exact fit bonuses. The worse ones might overcomplicate with unnecessary terms (like quantum-inspired, hyperbolic tangent) without clear benefits, or have static parameters that aren't optimized. For example, heuristic 8th adds context-aware synergy and predictive elements but might be too complex, leading to instability. The 18th-20th use terms like "quantum-inspired" which might not have a real basis, adding complexity without improving performance.

The middle ones like 13th-15th introduce dynamic adaptive exponents and penalties, which could be good but might not be as effective as the simpler, well-tuned top heuristics. The worst ones (like 19th, 20th) have overly complex formulas with entropic smoothing and topological scoring, which could introduce noise and make the heuristic less reliable.

Key insights: Effective heuristics balance simplicity with well-tuned components. Adding too many dynamic or complex elements without clear justification can degrade performance. Parameters like epsilon values and bonus weights need careful calibration. Exact fit handling with precision-aware checks is crucial. The best heuristics use a synergy between immediate and future packing, avoiding over-penalization or unnecessary complexity.

Experience points: Prioritize synergy between objectives with geometric means, use calibrated parameters, handle exact fits precisely, avoid overcomplicating with unproven terms, and maintain a balance between current efficiency and future flexibility.

**Analysis:**  
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a focused geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential with calibrated constants, while the worst introduces unnecessary complexity (quantum-inspired terms, hyperbolic transforms) that likely introduces noise. (2nd vs 19th) shows duplicated simple synergy scoring outperforms topological scoring with entropic smoothing. (8th vs 13th) reveals adaptive weight balancing and residual forecasting can help, but requires careful calibration to avoid overparameterization. (7th vs 17th) demonstrates that geometric mean of tightness/utilization works better than exponential boosts with arbitrary scaling. Overall: Top heuristics balance simplicity with precision-tuned components, while lower-ranked ones suffer from either under-calibration or overengineering.

**Experience:**  
Effective heuristics require: 1) Synergistic balance of competing objectives via multiplicative/geometric means 2) Precision-aware exact fit handling 3) Calibrated epsilon constants for numerical stability 4) Avoidance of ungrounded complexity (quantum/entropic metaphors). Optimal solutions emerge from principled tradeoffs, not additive feature creep.
