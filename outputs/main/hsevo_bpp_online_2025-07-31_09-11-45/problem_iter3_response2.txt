Okay, I need to create a priority_v2 function that's better than the existing priority_v1 for the online bin packing problem. Let me start by understanding what priority_v1 does. 

The current version calculates a synergy score using the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. Fill efficiency is the item size divided by the bin's remaining capacity, which prioritizes bins where the item fills a large portion. Residual potential is the square root of the remaining space after placing the item, encouraging leaving space that's useful for future items. Then it adds a bonus for exact fits.

The hints suggest thinking outside the box. Maybe I can introduce new metrics or combine existing ones in a smarter way. Let's see the hints provided: the user mentioned using adaptive thresholds, dynamic adaptation, and dimensional synergy. Also, they want to avoid static ratios and blind multiplicative blending.

So, for v2, perhaps I can add a dynamic component that adjusts based on the current state of the bins. For example, considering the distribution of remaining capacities. Also, maybe using a weighted combination of factors that adapts based on how much space is left.

Another idea: instead of just sqrt for residual potential, maybe use a function that changes based on the item size. Like, if the item is large, prioritize tighter packing, but if it's small, leave more flexible space. Or adjust the weight between fill efficiency and residual potential dynamically.

Wait, the existing synergy score is the geometric mean. Maybe using a weighted geometric mean where the weights depend on the item size or the current bin states. Or introduce a term that considers the diversity of bin capacities, encouraging placing items in bins that help create uniform remaining capacities, which might be better for future packing.

Alternatively, consider the variance in the remaining capacities. Bins with remaining capacities that are similar might be better for future items. So, a term that rewards placing the item in a bin that makes the remaining capacities more uniform.

But how to compute that efficiently? Maybe for each bin, after placing the item, calculate how close its remaining capacity is to the average of all bins. But that could be computationally expensive if there are many bins.

Alternatively, think about the 'waste' in each bin. The waste is the remaining capacity after placing the item. If we can minimize the sum of squares of wastes, that might lead to more efficient packing. But again, calculating that for each bin might not be straightforward.

Wait, the priority function needs to score each bin based on the item and the current bins_remain_cap. Let's think of each bin's score as a combination of several factors:

1. How well the item fits into the bin (fill efficiency).
2. How useful the remaining space will be for future items (residual potential).
3. Encouraging exact fits.
4. Maybe the current state of all bins (like average remaining capacity, etc.).

In v1, factors 1 and 2 are combined via geometric mean. Maybe in v2, introduce a dynamic weighting between these factors based on the item size or the current bin states.

For example, if the item is large relative to the average bin capacity, prioritize fill efficiency more. If the item is small, prioritize residual potential. That way, the heuristic adapts to the item's size.

Another angle: instead of sqrt for residual potential, use a function that depends on the item size. For instance, residual_potential = remaining_after^alpha, where alpha is a parameter that varies with the item size. Maybe for larger items, alpha is lower, making the residual potential less important, and vice versa.

Also, the perfection bonus in v1 adds 2.0 for exact fits. Maybe make this bonus dynamic. For example, if the exact fit is rare, give a higher bonus. Or scale it based on how close the item is to the bin's remaining capacity.

Another idea: introduce a term that considers the 'fragmentation' of the remaining space. If placing the item in a bin leaves a remaining capacity that's a common size for future items, that's good. But without knowing future items, this is tricky. However, maybe assume that future items have similar sizes to the current one, or use the current item's size as a hint.

Alternatively, use the current item's size to determine what residual space is useful. For example, if the item is size x, then residual space of x might be useful for another item of the same size. So, the residual potential could be higher if remaining_after is close to x.

But how to implement that? Maybe compute a term that is 1/(1 + |remaining_after - x|), which peaks when remaining_after equals x. But this might be too speculative.

Alternatively, compute the residual potential as the minimum between remaining_after and some function of the item size. For example, if remaining_after is larger than the item size, it's good because it can fit another similar item. But this is similar to existing approaches.

Wait, in v1, residual_potential is sqrt(remaining_after). The square root function diminishes the value of larger remaining spaces, which might not be optimal. Maybe a different function, like a logarithm, or a linear combination.

Another thought: the fill efficiency in v1 is item/(bin_remain_cap). But if the bin has a lot of space, this ratio is small. However, placing a large item in a bin with more space might leave a more flexible remaining capacity. Maybe adjust the fill efficiency to consider not just the current item but potential future items.

But again, without knowing future items, this is challenging. So perhaps the heuristic should focus on balancing immediate efficiency with flexible residual space, but in a more adaptive way.

Let me try to outline possible improvements:

1. Dynamic weighting between fill efficiency and residual potential based on the item size.
2. Adaptive exact fit bonus that considers the current distribution of bins.
3. A new term that encourages bins to have remaining capacities that are multiples of the item size, assuming future items might be similar.
4. Using a different combination method than geometric mean, such as harmonic mean or weighted sum.

Let's try combining some of these ideas. For example:

- Compute fill efficiency as before.
- Compute residual potential as remaining_after^alpha, where alpha is a function of the item size. For example, alpha = 1/(1 + item_size), so larger items have lower alpha, making residual potential less important.
- Introduce a term that rewards bins where remaining_after is a multiple of the item size, which could help in packing future items of the same size.
- Use a weighted sum of fill efficiency and residual potential, with weights depending on the item size.

But how to implement the multiple check? For example, if remaining_after is divisible by the item size (within some tolerance), add a bonus. However, with floating-point numbers, exact multiples are rare. Maybe check if remaining_after is >= item_size and (remaining_after % item_size) is close to zero. But modulo with floats is tricky. Alternatively, check if remaining_after is at least the item size, and then see if (remaining_after / item_size) is close to an integer. But this might be computationally intensive.

Alternatively, create a term that is higher when remaining_after is a multiple, but approximate it. For example, compute how many times the item_size fits into remaining_after, and if it's an integer, add a bonus. But again, with floating points, this is error-prone. Maybe use a tolerance and check if the division is close to an integer.

Alternatively, use a term like 1/(1 + |remaining_after - k*item_size|) for some integer k, but this might not be feasible without iterating k.

Hmm, perhaps this is too speculative. Let's think of other approaches.

Another angle: the current fill efficiency is item / bin_remain_cap. But for bins with larger remain_cap, this ratio is smaller. However, placing the item in a larger bin might leave more space, which could be better for future items. So maybe adjust the fill efficiency to consider the absolute remaining space. For example, fill_efficiency = item / (bin_remain_cap) + beta * remaining_after, where beta is a weight. But this combines two different objectives.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum of fill efficiency and residual potential, where the weights are determined dynamically. For instance, if the item is large, weight fill efficiency more; if small, weight residual potential more.

Let's formalize this. Suppose we have a parameter that depends on the item size. For example, if the item is large (close to 1, assuming bins have capacity 1), then we prioritize filling the bin tightly. If the item is small, we prioritize leaving a useful remaining space.

So, weight_fill = item_size
weight_residual = 1 - item_size

Then, the combined score could be weight_fill * fill_efficiency + weight_residual * residual_potential.

This way, for large items, fill efficiency is more important, and for small items, residual potential is more important.

In v1, the synergy score is the geometric mean, which is sqrt(fill * residual). This is a multiplicative approach. Using a weighted sum might allow more flexibility.

Additionally, the exact fit bonus could be adjusted. In v1, it's a fixed 2.0. Maybe make it scale with the item size. For example, if the item exactly fits, the bonus is higher for larger items, as they are harder to fit perfectly.

Also, handle the valid_mask correctly, setting invalid bins to -inf.

Putting this together:

def priority_v2(...):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0

    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(remaining_after + 1e-9)

    # Dynamic weights based on item size
    weight_fill = item
    weight_resid = 1 - item
    combined_score = (weight_fill * fill_efficiency) + (weight_resid * residual_potential)

    # Exact fit bonus scaled by item size
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=1e-8)
    perfection_bonus = exact_fit * (2.0 + item)  # Larger items get bigger bonus

    scores = np.where(valid_mask, combined_score + perfection_bonus, -np.inf)
    return scores

But wait, the residual_potential in v1 uses sqrt, but here I'm using it as is. Also, maybe the residual_potential could be adjusted. For example, using a different exponent based on item size.

Alternatively, for residual_potential, use remaining_after^alpha, where alpha is a function of item size. For example, alpha = 1 - item, so for large items, alpha is small, making residual_potential less important.

Another idea: introduce a term that considers the average remaining capacity of all bins. For example, if placing the item in a bin brings its remaining capacity closer to the average, that might be good for balance.

But calculating the average for each bin's hypothetical remaining_after might be computationally heavy. However, since we're processing each bin in the array, perhaps precompute the current average and see how each bin's remaining_after compares.

Wait, but the average would change after placing the item. Hmm, this might complicate things. Maybe not worth the computational cost for an online heuristic.

Alternatively, compute the variance of the remaining capacities. Placing the item in a bin that reduces the variance might be better. But again, this requires calculating for each bin how the variance would change, which is O(n) for each bin, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for large n.

So perhaps that's not practical. Let's stick to per-bin metrics.

Another angle: introduce a look-ahead by considering how much space is left relative to the item size. For example, if remaining_after is greater than or equal to the item size, that's good because it can fit another item of the same size. So, add a bonus for bins where remaining_after >= item.

But this is similar to the residual_potential idea. For example, if remaining_after >= item, then residual_potential could be higher. Maybe add a term that is 1 if remaining_after >= item, else 0. But with floating points, use a tolerance.

So:

fit_another = (remaining_after >= (item - 1e-8)) & valid_mask
fit_another_bonus = fit_another * 1.0

Then add this to the score. This encourages placing the item in a bin that can fit another one like it, which might be useful if future items are similar.

But this is speculative. However, in online BPP, we don't know future items, so assuming future items are similar to current ones is a heuristic.

Putting this together:

In the combined score, add a bonus if remaining_after can fit another item of the same size.

But how to compute that:

fit_another = (remaining_after >= (item - 1e-8)) & (remaining_after >= 0)
fit_another_bonus = fit_another.astype(float) * 0.5  # example weight

Then, the score becomes:

combined_score + perfection_bonus + fit_another_bonus

This adds another layer of heuristic.

Another idea: use the product of fill_efficiency and residual_potential, but with exponents that depend on the item size. For example:

synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** a) * (residual_potential ** b)

Where a and b are functions of item size. For large items, a is higher, b lower.

But how to choose a and b? Maybe a = item, b = 1 - item.

So:

a = item
b = 1 - item
synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** a) * (residual_potential ** b)

This way, for large items, fill_efficiency is emphasized more, and residual_potential less.

This is a dynamic version of the geometric mean, where the exponents adapt based on the item size.

Combining all these ideas, here's a possible v2:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + 1e-9)
    
    # Dynamic exponents based on item size
    a = item  # emphasizes fill efficiency more for larger items
    b = 1 - item  # emphasizes residual potential more for smaller items
    synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** a) * (residual_potential ** b)
    
    # Exact fit bonus scaled by item importance
    perfection_bonus = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=1e-8) * (3.0 * item + 0.5)
    
    # Bonus if remaining space can fit another item of same size (speculative)
    fit_another = (remaining_after >= (item - 1e-8)) & valid_mask
    future_fit_bonus = fit_another.astype(float) * 0.7 * (1 - item)  # stronger for small items
    
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score + perfection_bonus + future_fit_bonus, -np.inf)
    
    return scores

This version introduces several changes:

1. Dynamic exponents in the synergy score to weight fill efficiency and residual potential based on item size.
2. A scaled perfection bonus that increases with item size, making exact fits more valuable for larger items.
3. A speculative bonus for bins that can fit another item of the same size, which is more emphasized for smaller items.

Testing would be needed to see if this performs better, but theoretically, it adapts the heuristic based on the item size, which could lead to better overall performance.
