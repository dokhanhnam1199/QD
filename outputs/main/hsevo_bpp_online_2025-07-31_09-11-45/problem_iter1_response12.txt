Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about what strategies are effective here.

First, the goal is to minimize the number of bins used. So, the priority function should choose bins in a way that optimizes space utilization. 

In the existing priority_v1, it returns all zeros, which isn't helpful. So, I need to come up with a better heuristic.

Common heuristics for bin packing include First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, etc. Best Fit places the item in the bin with the least remaining space that can still accommodate it. That might be a good starting point.

But maybe I can combine multiple factors. For example, not just the remaining space after placing the item, but also how full the bin would be. A bin that's almost full after adding the item is better because it reduces fragmentation.

Wait, the priority function needs to assign a score to each bin. The bin with the highest score is chosen. So for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, the score should be very low (like negative infinity) so it's not selected.

For bins that can fit the item, the priority could be based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. Let's say we calculate the remaining capacity as bin_remain_cap - item. Then, a smaller remaining capacity is better because it fills the bin more. So the priority could be the negative of that remaining capacity. That way, bins that have the least space left after adding the item get higher scores. That's the Best Fit approach.

But maybe there's a way to make it even better. What if we also consider the current remaining capacity of the bin? For example, a bin that is already nearly full might be prioritized if adding the item fills it exactly. Or maybe a combination of the remaining space after adding the item and the current utilization.

Alternatively, we can use a weighted sum of different factors. For example, the score could be (remaining_capacity_after_adding_item) * -1 (so higher when less space is left) plus some other term. Or maybe the square of the remaining capacity to penalize larger leftover spaces more.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the sum of the reciprocal of the remaining capacity after placing the item. So if the remaining capacity is small, the reciprocal is large, giving a higher score. But if the remaining capacity is zero (perfect fit), the reciprocal would be infinity, which might not be practical. So maybe add a small epsilon to avoid division by zero.

Alternatively, use the remaining capacity after placing the item. For bins that can fit the item, the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item). But we want to minimize that, so the priority could be -(bin_remain_cap - item). That way, the bin with the smallest remaining space (after placing the item) gets the highest priority. That's exactly Best Fit.

But let's code that. For each bin, if the bin can fit the item (bin_remain_cap >= item), then the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item) * -1 (so higher is better). Bins that can't fit get a very low priority, like -infinity.

Wait, but in numpy, how to handle that. Let's see. We can compute the remaining after placing the item: remaining = bins_remain_cap - item. Then, for each bin, if remaining >=0, the priority is -remaining (so that the smallest remaining gets the highest priority). For bins where remaining <0, set their priority to -infinity.

So the code would be:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But wait, that would make the priority for valid bins equal to -(remaining space after adding item). So the bin with the least remaining space (i.e., the tightest fit) has the highest priority. That's exactly Best Fit.

But maybe there's a better way. For example, some heuristics also consider the current utilization. For instance, if a bin is already half full, maybe it's better to prioritize it. But in the online scenario, we can't look ahead. So Best Fit is a standard approach.

Alternatively, another heuristic is to maximize the sum of the square of the filled space in each bin. This is called the "Best Fit" with a different metric. For example, the score could be (current filled + item)^2. But that's more complex.

Wait, let's think again. The priority function for each bin is a score. The highest score is selected. So for each bin that can fit the item, the score is (current remaining capacity - item) → but we want to minimize that. So the score is -(remaining_after). So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = remaining_after >= 0
    # For valid bins, priority is -remaining_after (so higher when remaining_after is smaller)
    # For invalid, set to -infinity
    priority = np.where(valid, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return priority

But maybe there's a better way. For example, if two bins have the same remaining_after, perhaps we can break ties by preferring the bin with a higher current remaining capacity. Wait, no. Because if two bins can fit the item and have the same remaining_after, then they are equally good. But maybe in some cases, you want to prefer bins that are more filled. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the priority could be the sum of the current filled space plus the item. For example, (bin_remain_cap_original - bins_remain_cap) + item. But that's the same as (original capacity - remaining) + item. If original capacity is fixed (like 1), then it's (1 - remaining) + item. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after adding the item, but inverted. So the smaller the remaining, the higher the priority. Which is exactly what the code above does.

So the code for priority_v2 would implement the Best Fit heuristic. That's a standard approach. Let me check if that's correct.

Yes, Best Fit selects the bin with the smallest remaining space that can accommodate the item. So the code for priority_v2 would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate remaining capacity after adding the item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Valid bins are those where remaining_after >=0
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    # For valid bins, priority is -remaining_after (so higher priority for smaller remaining)
    # For invalid bins, set priority to -infinity
    priority = np.where(valid_mask, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return priority

But maybe to make it even better, we can add a small epsilon to the valid_mask to handle floating point inaccuracies. But the problem states that the item is a float, and bins_remain_cap is an array of floats. So perhaps the code is okay.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the sum of the current filled space plus the item. For example, if the bin's original capacity is 1 (assuming normalized), then filled = 1 - bins_remain_cap. After adding the item, filled becomes (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item. The priority could be this value, but only for bins that can fit. So the code would be:

filled_after = (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item
valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(valid, filled_after, -np.inf)

But this is equivalent to (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item)) → 1 - remaining_after. So the priority is 1 - remaining_after. Since remaining_after is bins_remain_cap - item, which is >=0 for valid bins. So higher filled_after is better, which is the same as lower remaining_after. So this is the same as the previous approach, just scaled and shifted. The order of priorities would be the same. So the code would have the same effect as the Best Fit.

But perhaps using the filled_after directly is more intuitive. However, the original code for Best Fit uses the remaining_after. Either way, the result is the same.

But the problem says to be creative. Maybe combine Best Fit with another heuristic. For example, if there's a bin that exactly fits the item (remaining_after is 0), that's the best possible. So perhaps prioritize those bins first.

But in the current code, if a bin has remaining_after=0, its priority is 0 (since -0 is 0). Wait, no. If remaining_after is 0, then -remaining_after is 0. But other bins with remaining_after positive would have negative priorities. Wait, no. Wait, remaining_after is bins_remain_cap - item. So for a valid bin, remaining_after is >=0. So -remaining_after is <=0. So the highest possible priority is 0 (when remaining_after is 0). All other valid bins have negative priorities. So the code would select the bin with remaining_after=0 first, then the next smallest, etc. That's correct.

But in that case, the code works as intended. So the code for priority_v2 is correct.

But maybe the user wants a different heuristic. For example, Worst Fit, which is the opposite: place the item in the bin with the largest remaining space after adding. But that's worse for bin packing. But the user asked to be creative. Alternatively, maybe a hybrid approach.

Alternatively, use a combination of Best Fit and some other metric. For example, the priority could be the remaining_after plus a term that encourages using bins that are already more filled. For example, the priority could be (remaining_after * -1) + (bins_remain_cap * 0.1). Wait, but that's adding a term that prefers bins with higher remaining capacity. That might not make sense.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_after * -1) + (1 - bins_remain_cap) * 0.1. So, the first term is Best Fit, the second term is the current filled space. This way, if two bins have the same remaining_after, the one that is more filled (higher current filled space) gets a slightly higher priority. But this is a bit arbitrary. However, it's a way to be creative.

But perhaps the user wants a more sophisticated approach. Let's think of another heuristic. For example, the "Almost Full" heuristic: prioritize bins that, after adding the item, are almost full. For example, if the remaining_after is less than a certain threshold, say 0.1, then give higher priority. But how to model that.

Alternatively, use a non-linear function of remaining_after. For example, the priority could be 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9) for valid bins. This way, bins with smaller remaining_after get much higher priorities. But this could lead to very large numbers when remaining_after is near zero. But in code, that's manageable.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = remaining_after >=0
    priority = np.where(valid, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return priority

This would assign higher scores to bins with smaller remaining_after. But this is similar to the Best Fit, but with a different scaling. However, this could lead to numerical issues if remaining_after is very small, but adding 1e-9 would prevent division by zero.

But this approach is more aggressive in prioritizing bins with very little remaining space. For example, a bin with remaining_after=0.1 would have a priority of 10, while a bin with remaining_after=0.2 would have 5. So the first bin is preferred. This is similar to Best Fit but with a different scaling. However, the order of priorities would be the same as Best Fit. So this approach is equivalent in terms of selection, but the scores are different. But since the selection is based on the maximum score, the order remains the same. So this approach is equivalent to Best Fit.

Hmm. So perhaps the initial approach is sufficient. But the user wants a creative approach. Let's think of another heuristic.

Another idea: consider the sum of the current filled space and the item. For example, the filled space after adding the item is (original capacity - bins_remain_cap) + item. If the original capacity is 1 (assuming normalized), then filled_after = (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item. The priority could be filled_after. But this is the same as (1 - bins_remain_cap + item) = (1 + item) - bins_remain_cap. So for valid bins (bins_remain_cap >= item), higher filled_after is better. But filled_after is maximized when bins_remain_cap is minimized (since it's subtracted). So this is equivalent to selecting the bin with the smallest bins_remain_cap that can fit the item. Wait, but that's different from Best Fit. Because Best Fit looks at the remaining after adding the item. Let's see.

Suppose two bins: bin A has 0.5 remaining, bin B has 0.6 remaining. The item is 0.3. Then, after adding, bin A's remaining is 0.2, bin B's is 0.3. Best Fit would choose bin A. But if we use filled_after, for bin A: (1 - 0.5) + 0.3 = 0.8. For bin B: (1 -0.6) +0.3=0.7. So bin A is selected. Same as Best Fit. Wait, but filled_after is (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item = (1 + item) - bins_remain_cap. So for a given item, the filled_after is higher when bins_remain_cap is lower. So the priority is to select the bin with the smallest bins_remain_cap that can fit the item. But that's the First Fit Decreasing approach? Or is it different?

Wait, no. Because bins_remain_cap is the current remaining capacity. So the filled_after is (original capacity - remaining) + item. But original capacity is fixed. So filled_after = (original capacity + item) - remaining. But original capacity is a constant. So for a given item, the filled_after is higher when remaining is lower. So the priority is to select the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can fit the item. But that's exactly the Best Fit approach. Because the remaining after adding the item is (remaining_cap - item). So the Best Fit is to minimize (remaining_cap - item), which is equivalent to selecting the bin with the smallest remaining_cap that can fit the item (since remaining_cap >= item). Wait, no. Because remaining_cap is the current remaining capacity. So if a bin has a remaining_cap of 0.5, and the item is 0.3, then after adding, the remaining is 0.2. Another bin with remaining_cap 0.4 and item 0.3 would have remaining 0.1. So the Best Fit would choose the second bin. But the filled_after for the first bin is (1 -0.5) +0.3=0.8, and for the second bin, (1-0.4)+0.3=0.9. So the filled_after approach would select the second bin, which is correct. So filled_after is equivalent to Best Fit.

So the code using filled_after is equivalent to the Best Fit approach. So perhaps the code can be written as:

filled_after = (1.0 - bins_remain_cap) + item  # assuming bin size is 1.0
valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(valid, filled_after, -np.inf)

But this assumes that the bin's original capacity is 1.0, which may not be the case. Wait, the problem statement says "fixed-sized bins", but the code is given bins_remain_cap. So the original capacity is not provided. So this approach is not feasible unless we know the original capacity. But the problem statement doesn't mention the original capacity. So this approach is not possible. Therefore, the initial approach of using remaining_after is better.

So going back to the original idea: the priority is -(remaining_after) for valid bins. That's the Best Fit approach.

But the user wants a creative approach. Maybe combine Best Fit with another heuristic. For example, if there are multiple bins with the same remaining_after, break ties by preferring bins that have a higher current remaining capacity. Wait, but why? That might not make sense. Alternatively, break ties by preferring bins that are more full. For example, if two bins have the same remaining_after, the one that was more full before adding the item is better. Because that bin was already more utilized.

So for example, bin A has remaining_cap 0.4, item is 0.3. remaining_after is 0.1. Bin B has remaining_cap 0.5, item is 0.4. remaining_after is 0.1. Both have same remaining_after, but bin B was less full before adding. So which one to choose? If we break ties by the current remaining_cap (before adding), then bin A (0.4) is better than bin B (0.5) because it was more full. So the priority could be a combination of remaining_after and the current remaining_cap.

But how to combine them. For example, the priority could be a tuple of (-remaining_after, -current_remaining_cap), and we sort by that. But in code, we need a single score. So perhaps the priority is -remaining_after * 1000 - current_remaining_cap. This way, remaining_after is the primary factor, and current_remaining_cap is the secondary. So for bins with the same remaining_after, the one with smaller current_remaining_cap (more full) is preferred.

But how to implement this. For example:

remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
valid = remaining_after >=0
priority = np.where(valid, (-remaining_after * 1000) - bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

This way, the primary factor is remaining_after (higher priority for smaller remaining_after), and the secondary factor is the current remaining_cap (prefer bins that are more full). For example, if two bins have remaining_after=0.1, but one has current_remaining_cap=0.4 and the other 0.5, the first bin's priority would be (-0.1 *1000) -0.4 = -100.4, the second is -100.5. So the first bin has higher priority (since -100.4 > -100.5). Wait, no. Because -100.4 is larger than -100.5. So the first bin is selected. So this approach breaks ties in favor of bins that were more full before adding the item.

This could be a creative approach. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    # Combine remaining_after (primary) and current remaining capacity (secondary)
    # Use a large multiplier to ensure remaining_after is the main factor
    priority_scores = (-remaining_after * 1000) - bins_remain_cap
    priority = np.where(valid_mask, priority_scores, -np.inf)
    return priority

This way, the primary factor is to minimize remaining_after (Best Fit), and the secondary factor is to minimize the current remaining capacity (i.e., prefer bins that are already more full). This could lead to better packing in some cases.

But why 1000? Because we want to ensure that the remaining_after is the dominant factor. For example, even a small difference in remaining_after (like 0.1 vs 0.2) would be multiplied by 1000, leading to a difference of 100, which is larger than the possible differences in current remaining_cap (which is up to 1.0, assuming bins are normalized). So this ensures that the primary factor is remaining_after.

This is a creative approach that combines two heuristics. So this could be a good priority_v2.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the sum of the square of the filled space. For example, filled_after squared. But again, this requires knowing the original capacity. So perhaps not.

Another idea: prioritize bins where adding the item would make the remaining capacity as small as possible, but also, if possible, leave a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if the remaining capacity after adding is 0.2, and another bin has 0.3, but there's an item of size 0.2 coming next, the first bin would be better. But this requires lookahead, which is not possible in online BPP. So this is not feasible.

So the best approach is to combine Best Fit with a secondary heuristic. The code I proposed earlier does that. So the final code would be as follows.
