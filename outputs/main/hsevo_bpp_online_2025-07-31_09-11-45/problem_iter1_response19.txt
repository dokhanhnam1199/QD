Okay, I need to create a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin for a given item, so that the bin with the highest score (and can fit the item) is chosen. Let's think about different heuristics that could work better than the trivial version.

First, the existing priority_v1 returns all zeros, which isn't helpful. So for priority_v2, I need a smarter approach. Let's recall common bin packing heuristics. The First Fit (FF) places an item in the first bin that fits. Best Fit (BF) puts the item in the bin with the least remaining space after placement. But since this is online, we need to make decisions as items arrive without knowing future ones.

But the priority function here can combine multiple factors. Maybe prioritize bins where the item fits perfectly, leaving no space. That's the "exact fit" scenario. Also, bins that have just enough space might be better to fill first to avoid small leftover fragments.

Another idea: assign higher priority to bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is minimized, but only if the item fits. That's similar to Best Fit. But how to handle bins that can't fit the item? Their priority should be very low or negative so they are not chosen.

Wait, the function should return a priority score for each bin. For bins where the item can't fit (item > bin's remaining capacity), their priority should be set to a very low value, like negative infinity, so they are ignored. For bins that can fit, calculate a score based on some criteria.

So the steps are:

1. Check which bins can accommodate the item (remaining capacity >= item size).
2. For those bins, compute a priority score. For others, set a low score.
3. The highest priority among feasible bins is selected.

Possible factors for the score:

- Remaining space after placing the item. Minimizing this (Best Fit) would mean higher priority for bins that leave less space. So the score could be the negative of (remaining_cap - item), which is -(leftover space). So higher leftover space gives lower priority. Wait, no: if we subtract, then a smaller leftover (like 0) would have a higher score. For example, if remaining_cap is 5 and item is 3, leftover is 2. The score would be -2. If another bin has remaining_cap 3 and item is 3, leftover is 0, score is 0. So higher score (0) is better. So the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) * -1. But maybe we can combine this with other factors.

Another approach: prioritize bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity that's a multiple of some value. For example, if the remaining capacity is even, or a certain fraction. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, consider the "fitness" of the item in the bin. For example, the ratio of the item size to the bin's remaining capacity. If the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining space, that's better. For example, if a bin has 5 left, and the item is 3, the ratio is 3/5 = 0.6. If another bin has 4 left, and the item is 3, ratio is 0.75. Higher ratio is better. So the priority could be the ratio. But this is similar to Best Fit, but in reverse. Wait, Best Fit picks the bin with the smallest remaining space after placement. The ratio here would prioritize bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining space. So for a bin with remaining capacity R, the ratio is item/R. But this would be higher when R is smaller. Wait, if R is 5 and item is 3, ratio is 0.6. If R is 3 and item is 3, ratio is 1.0. So higher ratio is better. So the priority could be the ratio, but only for bins where R >= item. For others, set to -infinity.

But how to handle this in code. Let's outline:

Compute for each bin:

if bin_remain_cap >= item:

   score = (item / bin_remain_cap)  # higher is better

else:

   score = -np.inf

But this would prefer bins where the item uses a larger proportion of the remaining space. For example, if a bin has 4 left, and item is 3, the ratio is 0.75. Another bin has 5 left, item is 3: ratio 0.6. So the first bin is preferred. But after placing the item, the first bin has 1 left, the second has 2 left. So this approach would leave smaller gaps, which is good. But this is similar to Best Fit, which picks the bin that leaves the smallest possible space. Wait, Best Fit is exactly that. So this approach is equivalent to Best Fit. But maybe we can combine this with other factors.

Alternatively, maybe we can add a term that gives higher priority to bins that are almost full. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 1 after placing the item, that's better than a bin that has 2. So the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) * -1, which is the same as (item - remaining_cap) but that's not possible. Wait, no. If the bin's remaining capacity is R, and the item is s, then after placing, the remaining is R - s. We want to minimize that. So the priority could be -(R - s), which is the same as (s - R). But since R >= s (because the item can fit), R - s is non-negative. So -(R - s) is negative. Wait, that's not helpful. Wait, for example, if R is 5, s is 3: R - s is 2. -(2) is -2. If R is 3, s is 3: R - s is 0. -(0) is 0. So the priority would be higher for the bin that leaves 0. So the priority is -(R - s) = s - R. But since R >= s, s - R is <=0. So the maximum possible is 0. So the priority for feasible bins is (s - R) + R? No. Wait, perhaps the priority should be (R - s) * -1. Which is s - R. But that's negative. Hmm. Maybe the priority should be (R - s) * -1, but that's the same as s - R. But for feasible bins, R >= s, so s - R is <=0. So the maximum is 0. So the priority would be 0 for exact fit, and negative otherwise. But then, the highest priority is 0, and others are lower. So this would prioritize exact fits first, then the ones with the least leftover. But in that case, the priority for exact fits is 0, and others are negative. So the exact fit bins would be selected first. Then, among non-exact fits, the ones with the smallest leftover (i.e., R - s is smallest) would have higher priority (since their s - R is less negative). So this approach would first choose exact fits, then the best fit. That's a good strategy.

So combining exact fit and best fit. So the priority could be:

For each bin:

if R >= s:

   if R == s:

       priority = 1.0  # highest possible

   else:

       priority = (1.0 / (R - s + 1e-9))  # inverse of leftover space. Smaller leftover gives higher priority.

But this would make exact fit bins have priority 1.0, and others have priority based on 1/(leftover). But the problem is that 1/(leftover) can be very large. For example, if leftover is 0.1, then 1/0.1 =10. But exact fit is 1.0. Wait, that's a problem. Because in that case, the exact fit would have lower priority than a bin with leftover 0.1. So that's not desired.

Ah, right. So the approach of giving exact fits a higher priority than any non-exact fit is better. So perhaps, for exact fits, assign a priority of 1.0, and for others, assign (1.0 / (R - s + 1e-9)), but scaled down so that even the smallest possible leftover (like 0.1) would have a priority less than 1.0. Wait, but 1/(0.1) is 10, which is higher than 1.0. So that's not good. So maybe the exact fit should have a higher priority than any non-exact. So perhaps, for exact fits, set priority to 2.0, and for others, 1/(R - s + 1e-9). But then, the exact fit would have higher priority. But how to balance this.

Alternatively, for exact fits, set a very high priority (like 1e9), and for others, compute 1/(R - s). So that exact fits are chosen first, then the best fit. That way, exact fits are prioritized, and among others, the one with the smallest leftover is chosen.

So the code would be:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, ... )

But let's code this.

First, compute the remaining capacity after placing the item: leftover = bins_remain_cap - item.

For bins where bins_remain_cap < item: set their score to -infinity.

For bins where bins_remain_cap >= item:

   if leftover == 0: score = 1e9 (a very high value)

   else: score = 1.0 / leftover

This way, exact fits are prioritized first. Then, the next best is the bin with the smallest leftover (since 1/0.1 is 10, which is higher than 1/0.2=5, etc.)

But in code, how to handle this.

Another approach: create a mask for exact fits. Then, assign a high score to those, and for others, compute 1/(leftover). But also, we need to handle the case where leftover is zero.

So in code:

leftover = bins_remain_cap - item

valid_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

exact_fit_mask = np.isclose(leftover, 0)  # or (leftover == 0), but with floating point precision?

scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

# For valid bins, compute scores
scores[valid_mask] = 1.0 / (leftover[valid_mask] + 1e-9)  # add small epsilon to avoid division by zero

# Then, set exact fits to a higher score
scores[exact_fit_mask & valid_mask] = 1e9  # a very high value

But wait, if a bin is an exact fit, then leftover is zero. So 1/(0 + 1e-9) is 1e9, which is the same as the value we set. So maybe this is redundant. Wait, no. For exact fits, the code would first set the score to 1e9 (from 1/(0 + 1e-9) = 1e9), and then if we set exact_fit_mask to 1e9 again, it's the same. So perhaps the code can be simplified.

Wait, let's see:

For a bin that can fit the item:

if leftover is 0, then 1/(0 + 1e-9) = 1e9. So the score is 1e9.

If leftover is 0.5, then 1/0.5 = 2.

So the exact fit bins get a very high score, and others get 1/(leftover). So the priority is to choose exact fits first, then the ones with the smallest leftover.

But this is exactly the Best Fit strategy, but with exact fits prioritized. So this could be a good approach.

But in code, how to handle this.

Another thing to consider: using the reciprocal of the leftover space. But since leftover can be very small (like 0.1), the reciprocal can be large. But since exact fits are already handled, maybe this is okay.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    # Calculate leftover space if item is placed in each bin
    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Check which bins can fit the item
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item - 1e-9  # considering floating point precision
    # Initialize scores to -infinity
    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    # For bins that can fit, calculate their scores
    # For exact fits, set a very high score, else 1/(leftover)
    scores[can_fit] = np.where(
        np.isclose(leftover[can_fit], 0),
        1e9,
        1.0 / (leftover[can_fit] + 1e-9)  # add epsilon to avoid division by zero
    )
    return scores

Wait, but in the code above, for can_fit bins, we check if their leftover is close to zero. If yes, assign 1e9, else 1/(leftover). That way, exact fits get the highest priority, and others are prioritized by the reciprocal of their leftover space.

This should work. Let's test with some examples.

Example 1: item is 3, bins_remain_cap is [3, 4, 5].

Leftover would be [0, 1, 2]. The scores for these bins would be 1e9, 1/1=1, 1/2=0.5. So the first bin (exact fit) is selected.

Example 2: item is 3, bins_remain_cap is [4, 5, 2]. The third bin can't fit. The first bin's leftover is 1, score 1. Second bin's leftover is 2, score 0.5. So the first bin is selected.

Another example: item is 2.5, bins_remain_cap is [2.5, 3, 2.4]. The third bin can't fit. The first bin is exact fit (score 1e9), second bin's leftover is 0.5 (score 2). So first bin is selected.

If there's no exact fit, then the bin with the smallest leftover gets the highest score. For example, item is 3, bins_remain_cap [4,5,6]. Leftover is 1,2,3. Scores are 1, 0.5, 0.333. So the first bin is selected.

This seems to align with the Best Fit strategy, but with exact fits prioritized. This should perform better than the basic Best Fit.

Another possible improvement: consider the current utilization of the bin. For example, a bin that is already more full might be preferred. But since the remaining capacity is given, perhaps combining the remaining capacity after placement with the original bin size. Wait, but the problem states that the bins are fixed size. So the original bin size is fixed (say, 1.0 if normalized). So the remaining capacity after placing the item is (original capacity - sum of items in bin) - item. Wait, no. The bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the original capacity is not given. So perhaps we can't use that.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of the leftover space and the current remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.8, and the item is 0.3, then after placing, the leftover is 0.5. But maybe a bin that is closer to being filled is better. So perhaps the priority could be (original remaining capacity) - (leftover). Which is (R) - (R - s) = s. Which is the item size. That's not helpful. Hmm.

Alternatively, the priority could be (1 - (R - s)) / (R), but I'm not sure. Maybe that's complicating things.

Another idea: prioritize bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if the remaining capacity is even, but that's arbitrary. Not sure.

Alternatively, use a weighted combination of factors. For example, the reciprocal of the leftover space plus the reciprocal of the remaining capacity. But that might not make sense.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) * -1, which is the same as (item - remaining_cap). But since remaining_cap >= item, this would be negative. So the maximum is 0 (exact fit). So the priority would be 0 for exact fit, and negative otherwise. Then, among non-exact fits, the one with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) would have the least negative score. So the priority would be sorted as exact fits first, then the best fit. But how to represent this in code.

In that case, the code would be:

scores = np.where(
    can_fit,
    -(bins_remain_cap - item),
    -np.inf
)

But for exact fits, this would be 0. For others, it's -(R - s) = s - R. Since R >= s, this is negative. So the highest possible is 0 (exact fits), then the next highest is the least negative (smallest R - s). So this would also prioritize exact fits first, then best fit. But the scores for non-exact would be negative. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item - 1e-9
    scores = np.where(
        can_fit,
        -(bins_remain_cap - item),
        -np.inf
    )
    return scores

But this is equivalent to Best Fit, but with exact fits getting 0 and others negative. So the highest score is 0 (exact fits), then the next highest is the least negative (smallest R - s). So this is a valid approach. But how does this compare to the previous approach with reciprocal?

In the previous approach, exact fits get a very high score, and others get 1/(R - s). So for example, if R - s is 0.1, the score is 10. If R - s is 0.2, the score is 5. So the first approach would prioritize the bin with 0.1 leftover over the one with 0.2. But in the second approach, the scores would be -0.1 and -0.2. So the first approach's scores are higher for smaller leftovers, which is correct.

But the first approach (reciprocal) gives higher scores to smaller leftovers, which is correct. The second approach (negative of leftover) gives higher scores (closer to zero) for smaller leftovers. So both approaches would prioritize exact fits first, then best fit. The difference is in how they handle non-exact fits. The reciprocal approach gives higher scores to smaller leftovers, which is the same as Best Fit. The negative approach also does the same. So both approaches are similar. But the reciprocal approach gives a higher dynamic range. For example, a leftover of 0.1 gives a score of 10, while 0.2 gives 5. So the difference in scores is larger. This might help in cases where there are multiple bins with varying leftovers.

But which approach is better? It's hard to say without testing, but the reciprocal approach might be more aggressive in preferring smaller leftovers. However, the exact fit is prioritized in both cases.

Another possible heuristic is to use the sum of the item size and the current used space. For example, a bin that is more full might be preferred. But since the remaining capacity is given, the used space is (original capacity - remaining capacity). But since we don't know the original capacity, this is not possible. So that's not applicable here.

So, considering all this, the first approach (exact fit with high priority, others with reciprocal of leftover) seems like a good candidate. Let's proceed with that.

Now, code-wise, how to handle floating point precision. For example, checking if leftover is exactly zero might not be reliable due to floating point errors. So using np.isclose with a small tolerance.

So in code:

leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= (item - 1e-9)
exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9, rtol=0)

scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
scores[can_fit] = np.where(
    exact_fit[can_fit],
    1e9,
    1.0 / (leftover[can_fit] + 1e-9)
)

This way, even if there's a tiny leftover due to floating point precision, it's considered as exact fit if it's within the tolerance.

Putting it all together:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    leftover = bins_remain_cap - item
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= (item - 1e-9)
    exact_fit = np.isclose(leftover, 0, atol=1e-9, rtol=0)
    scores = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    scores[can_fit] = np.where(
        exact_fit[can_fit],
        1e9,
        1.0 / (leftover[can_fit] + 1e-9)
    )
    return scores

This should work. Let's test some cases.

Test case 1: item=3, bins_remain_cap = [3,4,5]. leftover is [0,1,2]. can_fit is [True, True, True]. exact_fit is [True, False, False]. So scores for can_fit bins are 1e9, 1/1=1, 1/2=0.5. So the first bin is selected.

Test case 2: item=3, bins_remain_cap = [4,3,2]. The third bin can't fit. leftover is [1,0, -1]. can_fit is [True, True, False]. exact_fit is [False, True, False]. So scores for first two bins: second bin gets 1e9, first gets 1/1=1. So the second bin is selected.

Test case 3: item=2.5, bins_remain_cap = [2.5, 2.6, 2.4]. The third bin can't fit. leftover is [0, 0.1, -0.1]. can_fit is [True, True, False]. exact_fit is [True, False, False]. So first bin gets 1e9, second gets 1/0.1=10. So first bin is selected.

Another test case: item=2, bins_remain_cap = [3, 2.5, 2]. leftover is [1, 0.5, 0]. can_fit is [True, True, True]. exact_fit is [False, False, True]. So third bin gets 1e9, others get 1/1=1 and 1/0.5=2. So third bin is selected.

This seems to work as intended. So this priority function should prioritize exact fits first, then the best fit (smallest leftover) for non-exact fits.

Another possible improvement: adding a tie-breaker. For example, if two bins have the same leftover, perhaps prefer the one with a larger remaining capacity before placing the item. But I'm not sure. For example, if two bins have remaining capacities 4 and 5, and the item is 3. Both would have leftover 1 and 2. Wait, no. If item is 3, then for remaining capacities 4 and 5, the leftovers are 1 and 2. So the first bin is better. But if two bins have the same leftover, like 1, then which to choose? Maybe prefer the one with larger original remaining capacity. But since the remaining capacity after placing is the same, it might not matter. But perhaps in some cases, leaving more flexibility for future items. For example, if two bins have the same leftover after placing the item, but one had a larger remaining capacity before. But since the remaining capacity after is the same, it's the same for future items. So maybe it's not necessary.

In any case, the current approach should be a solid improvement over the trivial version.
