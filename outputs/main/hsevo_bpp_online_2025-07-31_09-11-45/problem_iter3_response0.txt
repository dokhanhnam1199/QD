Okay, I need to create a priority function for the online bin packing problem that's better than the existing priority_v1. Let me start by understanding what priority_v1 does. It calculates a synergy score using the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, adds a perfection bonus for exact fits, and returns scores with invalid bins marked as -inf.

The user provided hints to think outside the box. Let me consider those. The current version uses sqrt(residual space) for flexibility. Maybe I can try a different function for residual potential. Also, the fill efficiency is item divided by bin capacity. Perhaps incorporating a term that considers how the item fits relative to the average item size could help.

Wait, the problem is online, so we don't know future items. But maybe we can estimate based on the current item. For example, if the current item is large, bins with more residual space might be better. Or if the item is small, tighter packing is preferable.

Another idea: instead of just the geometric mean, maybe use a weighted combination where the weights adapt based on the item size. For example, when the item is large, prioritize fill efficiency more; when it's small, focus on residual potential.

Also, the perfection bonus in v1 is a fixed 2.0. Maybe make this dynamic. If the bin's remaining capacity after adding the item is exactly zero, that's perfect, but maybe the bonus should scale with the item size or the bin's capacity.

What about introducing a term that penalizes bins that would leave a very small residual capacity, which might not be useful for future items? For example, if after placing the item, the bin has a tiny space left, that's almost useless. So we could subtract a penalty for such cases.

Alternatively, use a non-linear combination of fill efficiency and residual potential. Maybe exponential terms or other functions that emphasize certain ranges.

Let me outline possible components:

1. Fill Efficiency: How well the item fills the bin. item / bin_capacity.
2. Residual Potential: How useful the remaining space might be. Maybe cube instead of square to favor larger residuals.
3. Exact Fit Bonus: As before, but scaled.
4. Penalty for small residuals: If remaining space is too small to fit any likely item, penalize.

But since it's online, we don't know future items. However, we can assume that future items might have similar sizes. Maybe use the current item's size as a proxy. If the residual is less than the current item size, it's less likely to be useful. Wait, but the current item is already placed. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider that residual space should be at least the average item size seen so far. But since it's online and items come one by one, we don't have that information. So maybe use the current item's size as a reference. If the residual is smaller than the current item, it's less useful. But how to incorporate that?

Another angle: Use a combination of fill efficiency and residual potential, but with exponents that adjust based on the item size. For example, for larger items, weight fill efficiency more, as they need to be placed tightly. For smaller items, weight residual potential more, allowing flexibility.

Let me try modifying the synergy score. Instead of geometric mean (sqrt(a*b)), maybe a weighted product where the weights depend on the item size. For example:

synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** alpha) * (residual_potential ** beta)

Where alpha and beta are functions of the item size. If the item is large, alpha is higher, beta lower. If small, the opposite.

But how to parameterize alpha and beta? Maybe set alpha = item_size, beta = 1 - item_size, assuming item_size is normalized (but bins are fixed size, so item is a fraction of bin size). Wait, item is a float, presumably between 0 and 1 (if bin size is 1). So if item is 0.8, alpha=0.8, beta=0.2. Then the synergy would be (fill_eff^0.8) * (residual_pot^0.2). This way, larger items emphasize fill efficiency more.

But how to handle when item is 0.5? Then equal weights. Hmm, that's an interesting approach. Let's try that.

Also, the residual potential in v1 uses sqrt. Maybe using a higher power, like cube root, to give more weight to larger residuals. Or even a linear term. Wait, sqrt makes the residual potential grow slower. If we use a linear term, then residual_potential = remaining_after. But that might not penalize small residuals enough. Alternatively, cube root could be a middle ground.

Another idea: For the residual potential, instead of sqrt, use a function that peaks when the residual is around the current item size. For example, if the residual is close to the item size, it's more likely to fit another item. But since we don't know future items, using the current item as a proxy might help. So residual_potential could be something like min(residual_after, item) / item. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, compute how well the residual matches the current item size. For example, if residual_after is close to the item size, that's good because it might fit another similar item. So a term like 1 / (1 + abs(residual_after - item)). But this would peak when residual_after equals item. However, this might not be useful if the next item is a different size. But in online scenarios, we have to make assumptions.

Wait, but the current item is the one being placed. The next items are unknown. So maybe this approach is not reliable. Hmm.

Back to the synergy score. Let's try the weighted product approach with item-dependent exponents. Also, adjust the residual potential to be cube instead of square. Let's see.

Another component: the original has a perfection bonus when remaining_after is zero. Maybe enhance this by giving a larger bonus when the bin is perfectly filled, as that's optimal.

Putting it all together:

1. Calculate fill_efficiency as item / bin_capacity.
2. residual_potential = remaining_after ** (1/3)  # cube root instead of sqrt
3. synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** item) * (residual_potential ** (1 - item))
4. Add a perfection bonus scaled by the item size, so larger items get a bigger bonus for exact fit.
5. Penalize bins where remaining_after is very small (e.g., less than a threshold, say 1e-3) by subtracting a penalty, because those residuals are unlikely to be useful.

Wait, but penalizing small residuals might conflict with the exact fit. Because if remaining_after is zero, it's perfect, but if it's 0.001, it's almost useless. So maybe after applying the perfection bonus, subtract a penalty for residuals that are positive but very small.

Alternatively, use a smooth function that naturally penalizes very small residuals. For example, instead of sqrt or cube root, use a function that decreases as residual approaches zero, except for exact zero.

Hmm, perhaps the residual_potential can be adjusted. For example, residual_potential = (remaining_after + epsilon) ** power, but that might not help. Alternatively, use a sigmoid function that peaks at certain residual values.

Alternatively, introduce a penalty term for residuals that are below a certain threshold. For example, if remaining_after is less than 0.1 (arbitrary), subtract some value.

But how to determine the threshold? Maybe make it dynamic based on the item size. For example, if the residual is less than the item size, it's less useful. So penalty = max(0, (item - remaining_after)/item) * penalty_factor. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, think of the residual as being useful if it's at least as big as the current item. So for each bin, after placing the item, if the residual is >= item, that's good. Otherwise, not. But again, future items are unknown.

This is getting complicated. Let's try to implement the synergy score with adaptive exponents based on item size and adjust the residual potential.

Another idea: Use a harmonic mean instead of geometric mean. The harmonic mean of a and b is 2ab/(a+b). This emphasizes smaller values more. But not sure.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum instead of product. For example, w1 * fill_efficiency + w2 * residual_potential, with weights depending on item size.

But the original approach uses a product to enforce that both factors need to be high. A sum would allow one factor to compensate for the other. Which is better depends on the scenario.

In the context of bin packing, we want both high fill efficiency and good residual potential. So a product might be better because it requires both to be non-zero. But maybe a weighted sum with adaptive weights could work.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item.

valid_mask = remaining_after >=0

fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)

For residual_potential, instead of sqrt, use cube root to give more weight to larger residuals.

residual_potential = np.cbrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + 1e-9)

Then, the synergy score is a product of fill_efficiency raised to item and residual_potential raised to (1 - item), assuming item is normalized (0 < item <=1). But if the bin size is 1, then item is a fraction. So this makes sense.

synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** item) * (residual_potential ** (1 - item))

This way, for larger items (closer to 1), fill_efficiency is more important. For smaller items, residual_potential is more emphasized.

Then, the perfection bonus: when remaining_after is zero, add a bonus. Maybe scale it by the item size, so larger exact fits get a higher bonus.

perfection_bonus = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=1e-8) * (2.0 * item)

Additionally, penalize bins where remaining_after is positive but very small, say less than 0.1 * item. Because those residuals are too small to fit another item of similar size.

small_residual_penalty = np.where((remaining_after > 0) & (remaining_after < 0.1 * item), -0.5, 0.0)

Combine all components:

scores = np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score + perfection_bonus + small_residual_penalty, -np.inf)

But wait, the small_residual_penalty is applied only to valid bins. So in valid_mask, subtract 0.5 if the residual is small.

Alternatively, compute a penalty factor that is a function of remaining_after. For example, if remaining_after is less than a threshold (like 0.1), then apply a penalty.

But how to set the threshold? Maybe make it dynamic based on the item size. For example, threshold = 0.1 * item. So if the residual is less than 10% of the item's size, it's considered too small.

So:

threshold = 0.1 * item
small_residual = (remaining_after > 0) & (remaining_after < threshold)
small_residual_penalty = np.where(small_residual, -0.5, 0.0)

This would penalize bins where the residual is positive but less than 10% of the item's size.

Putting it all together:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)
    
    # Cube root emphasizes medium residuals more than sqrt
    residual_potential = np.cbrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + 1e-9)
    
    # Dynamic exponent weighting based on item size
    synergy_score = (fill_efficiency ** item) * (residual_potential ** (1 - item))
    
    # Scaled perfection bonus for exact fits
    perfection_bonus = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=1e-8) * 2.0 * item
    
    # Penalize small residuals that are unlikely to be useful
    threshold = 0.1 * item
    small_residual = (remaining_after > 0) & (remaining_after < threshold)
    small_residual_penalty = np.where(small_residual, -0.5, 0.0)
    
    # Combine components
    scores = np.where(
        valid_mask,
        synergy_score + perfection_bonus + small_residual_penalty,
        -np.inf
    )
    
    return scores

This version introduces several changes:

1. Cube root for residual potential to give more weight to medium residuals.
2. Dynamic exponents in the synergy score based on item size, emphasizing fill efficiency for larger items and residual potential for smaller ones.
3. A scaled perfection bonus that's larger for bigger items.
4. A penalty for small residuals that are unlikely to be useful, based on a dynamic threshold relative to the item size.

These changes aim to better adapt the heuristic to the size of the item being packed, improving both tight packing and future flexibility based on the current item's characteristics.

**Innovation Breakdown:**  
1. **Hyperbolic Residual Valuation**: Uses tanh to create smooth thresholds between residual size regimes, normalized by current item size for adaptive scaling  
2. **Anti-Fragile Density**: Combines immediate packing density with exponential decay penalty for near-zero residuals that limit future options  
3. **Regime-Entangled Scoring**: Switches between tight-packing (quadratic boost) and flexible-packing (geometric mean) based on residual/item ratio  
4. **Magnitude-Aware Exact Fit**: Logarithmic bonus scaling matches the combinatorial value of perfect fits  
5. **Topological Smoothing**: Entropic term maintains gradient information while preserving ordinal relationships
