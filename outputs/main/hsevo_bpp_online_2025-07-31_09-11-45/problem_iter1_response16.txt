Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin when a new item arrives, so that the bin with the highest score (and can fit the item) is chosen. Let me think about different strategies that could work here.

First, the existing priority_v1 just returns zeros, which isn't helpful. So I need to come up with a smarter heuristic. Let's recall common bin packing heuristics. There's the First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, etc. Best Fit tries to place the item in the bin that leaves the least space left. But maybe there's a way to combine different factors.

Hmm, Stephen Hawking's perspective might involve thinking about black holes and entropy. Maybe the bins are like regions of space, and items are mass being added. The priority could consider both the remaining capacity after adding the item and some measure of the "density" or efficiency.

Wait, but how to translate that into a mathematical formula. Let's think: For each bin, if the item fits (i.e., bin's remaining capacity >= item size), we calculate a score. The priority should be higher for bins where adding the item would make the remaining capacity as small as possible, but also considering the utilization of the bin.

Alternatively, maybe a combination of factors. For example, the score could be a weighted sum of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the inverse of the remaining capacity. Or perhaps something that maximizes the filled space while minimizing the leftover space.

Another idea: The priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining space after placing the item. So, if placing the item leaves very little space, that's good (high priority). But if the remaining space is zero, that's perfect. This is similar to Best Fit.

But maybe we can also consider the current utilization of the bin. For example, a bin that is already half-full might be prioritized differently. Or, perhaps a bin that, after adding the item, would be as full as possible, but also considering the entropy of the distribution of filled bins.

Wait, another approach: The priority could be the sum of the square of the filled space after adding the item. This is similar to the Best Fit Decreasing heuristic, which aims to minimize the leftover space. But since it's online, we can't sort the items.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but inverted. So, for bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is smaller, the priority is higher. But we need to handle cases where the item doesn't fit (those bins get a very low priority, maybe negative infinity).

Wait, the function needs to return a priority score for each bin. So for each bin in bins_remain_cap, if the bin can fit the item (i.e., bin_remain_cap[i] >= item), then compute a score. Otherwise, the score is -infinity (so it's not selected).

So the steps are:

1. For each bin, check if the item can fit. If not, assign a very low priority (like -np.inf).
2. For bins that can fit, calculate a score based on some heuristic.

Possible heuristics for the score:

- Best Fit: The score is -(remaining_capacity - item), which is equivalent to the negative of the space left after placing the item. So the bin with the smallest remaining space gets the highest priority. But since we want the highest score, maybe the score is (remaining_capacity - item) but inverted. Wait, no. If remaining_capacity after placing is (current_remain - item), then the smaller that value, the better. So the priority could be 1/(remaining_capacity - item + 1e-9) to avoid division by zero. But if the remaining is zero, that's perfect. So higher priority.

Alternatively, the score could be (current_remain_cap - item) but inverted. So for a bin that after placing the item has 0 remaining, the score is highest.

Another idea: The score is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) if that's possible. Wait, maybe not. Let's think numerically. Suppose a bin has remaining capacity 0.5, and the item is 0.3. After placing, remaining is 0.2. The score could be 0.8 (the filled space: 1 - 0.2 = 0.8). So the filled space after adding the item is (1 - (remaining_cap - item))? Wait, original bin size is 1, right? Because in bin packing, bins are usually of fixed size. So the remaining capacity is how much is left. So the filled space is (1 - remaining_cap). When you add the item, the filled space becomes (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = (1 - remaining_cap + item) = (item + (1 - remaining_cap)). Wait, that's the sum of the item and the existing filled space. So the filled space after adding the item is (existing filled) + item. So the filled space is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - remaining_cap + item = (1 - remaining_cap) + item. Which is the existing filled plus the item. So the filled space is the sum of the existing items plus the new item. So the filled space is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - (remaining_cap - item) = 1 - remaining_cap + item. So the filled space is (current filled) + item. So the filled space after adding the item is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)).

So the priority could be based on the filled space after adding the item. So higher filled space is better. So the score would be (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) which is (filled space after adding). So the priority is that value. But for bins that can't fit, the score is -infinity.

But wait, in that case, the priority would be higher for bins that, after adding the item, are more full. So this is similar to Best Fit, which tries to leave as little space as possible. But in this case, the priority is the filled space, so higher is better. So the bin with the highest filled space after adding the item would be selected. That's exactly Best Fit.

But maybe we can combine this with other factors. For example, considering the current filled space. Or, perhaps, the square of the filled space, to prioritize bins that are more full (since squaring would give higher weight to higher values). For example, (filled_after)^2. So a bin that is 0.9 filled would have a higher priority than one that is 0.8.

Alternatively, the priority could be (filled_after) + (filled_after)^2. Or some other combination.

Another approach: The priority could be the filled_after plus a term that encourages spreading out items. Wait, but that's conflicting. Hmm.

Alternatively, think about entropy. In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of disorder. Maybe we can model the system's entropy and try to minimize it. But how to apply that here.

Alternatively, think of the bins as black holes. The more massive (filled) a bin is, the more it can attract items. But perhaps the priority is higher for bins that are more massive (filled) and can still accommodate the item. So the priority could be (filled_after) * (1 + filled_after), which gives higher weight to bins that are already more filled. This would encourage items to be placed into bins that are already more full, thus trying to fill them up completely.

Alternatively, the priority could be (filled_after) ** 3, which would heavily prioritize bins that are almost full.

Wait, but in the online scenario, we can't look ahead. So the heuristic has to be based on current state and the item being added.

Another idea: The priority is the filled_after divided by the remaining space after adding the item. For example, filled_after / (remaining_after). But if remaining_after is zero, division by zero occurs. So maybe add a small epsilon. This ratio would be high when filled_after is high and remaining_after is low. For example, if a bin is 0.9 filled after adding, remaining is 0.1, ratio is 9. If another bin is 0.8 filled, remaining 0.2, ratio is 4. So the first bin gets higher priority. This would prioritize bins that are filled more and have less remaining space. But this could be a good heuristic.

So the priority score for a bin would be (filled_after) / (remaining_after + epsilon), where epsilon is a small value to prevent division by zero. This way, bins that are almost full (high filled_after and low remaining_after) get higher scores.

Alternatively, the score could be (filled_after) + (1 / (remaining_after + epsilon)), combining both filled space and the inverse of remaining space. But this might need to be balanced with coefficients.

Hmm. Let's think of some examples. Suppose two bins:

Bin A: remaining_cap is 0.3. Item is 0.2. After adding, remaining is 0.1. Filled_after is 0.9. remaining_after is 0.1. So filled_after / remaining_after is 9.

Bin B: remaining_cap is 0.4. Item is 0.3. After adding, remaining is 0.1. Filled_after is 0.9. Same as bin A. So same priority.

Another example: Bin C has remaining_cap 0.2. Item is 0.1. After adding, remaining is 0.1. Filled_after is 0.9. So same as before. But if another bin D has remaining_cap 0.5, item is 0.4. After adding, remaining is 0.1. Filled_after is 0.9. So same priority. So in this case, all bins that can fit the item and result in 0.9 filled would have the same priority. But maybe this is acceptable.

But what if there's a bin that can fit the item and result in a filled_after of 0.8, but the remaining_after is 0.2. Then filled_after / remaining_after is 4. So lower than the 0.9/0.1=9 case. So the priority would be higher for the 0.9 case.

This seems like a good heuristic. So the priority function would calculate for each bin (if it can fit the item) the filled_after divided by (remaining_after + epsilon), and assign that as the score. Bins that can't fit get -infinity.

But how to implement this in code.

First, compute the remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item. But only for bins where bins_remain_cap >= item. For others, set the score to -infinity.

Then, filled_after = 1 - (remaining_after). Because the total bin size is 1 (assuming normalized sizes). Wait, but in the problem statement, the bins are fixed size. The problem doesn't specify the bin size. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the initial capacity is the bin size. But the problem says "fixed-sized bins", so each bin has the same capacity. Let's assume the bin capacity is 1.0, and items are normalized between 0 and 1. So the remaining capacity is how much space is left in the bin.

So filled_after = (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - remaining_cap + item = (1 - remaining_cap) + item. Which is the current filled space (1 - remaining_cap) plus the item. So filled_after is the total filled after adding the item.

But if the bin's remaining capacity is, say, 0.5, and the item is 0.3, then after adding, remaining is 0.2. filled_after is 0.8.

So the filled_after is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - (0.5 - 0.3) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

So the filled_after is correct.

So the priority score for a bin that can fit the item is (filled_after) / (remaining_after + epsilon). Where remaining_after is (remaining_cap - item). So:

filled_after = 1 - (remaining_cap - item) = 1 - remaining_cap + item.

But 1 - remaining_cap is the current filled space. So filled_after is current filled + item.

But perhaps the code can compute filled_after as (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item)).

But in code:

remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
filled_after = 1 - remaining_after  # because 1 - (remaining_cap - item) = 1 - remaining_cap + item = (1 - remaining_cap) + item = current filled + item.

But wait, 1 - remaining_cap is the current filled space. So filled_after is current filled + item.

Yes.

So the priority score is filled_after / (remaining_after + 1e-9). The 1e-9 is to avoid division by zero.

But for bins where bins_remain_cap < item, the remaining_after is negative, so we set their score to -infinity.

So in code:

def priority_v2(...):
    # Compute remaining after adding the item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Check which bins can fit the item
    valid = remaining_after >= 0
    # Calculate filled_after for all bins, but only use valid ones
    filled_after = 1 - remaining_after
    # Compute the score: filled_after / (remaining_after + epsilon)
    epsilon = 1e-9
    scores = np.where(valid, filled_after / (remaining_after + epsilon), -np.inf)
    return scores

Wait, but filled_after is 1 - remaining_after. So filled_after = 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) = 1 - bins_remain_cap + item. Which is the same as (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item. So the filled_after is the current filled space (1 - bins_remain_cap) plus the item. Which makes sense.

So the priority is filled_after divided by the remaining_after (plus epsilon). This ratio is higher when filled_after is large and remaining_after is small. For example, if a bin after adding the item is 0.9 filled (filled_after=0.9, remaining_after=0.1), the ratio is 9. If another bin is 0.8 filled with 0.2 remaining, ratio is 4. So the first bin gets higher priority.

This heuristic would prioritize putting the item into the bin that, after adding, has the highest filled to remaining ratio. This could lead to better utilization by filling up bins as much as possible.

Another possible adjustment: Adding a power to the filled_after. For example, (filled_after ** 2) / (remaining_after + epsilon). This would give even higher priority to bins that are more filled. For example, 0.9^2 / 0.1 = 8.1, 0.8^2 / 0.2 = 3.2. So the difference is more pronounced.

But which is better? It depends on empirical testing. But given that the problem is online, perhaps the first approach is a good starting point.

Alternatively, the priority could be filled_after + (1 / (remaining_after + epsilon)), which combines both terms. But this would need to balance the scales. For example, filled_after is 0.9, 1/(0.1) is 10. So sum is 10.9. For a bin with filled_after 0.8 and remaining_after 0.2, sum is 0.8 +5=5.8. So the first bin is better. But this might be overemphasizing the remaining_after. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be filled_after * (1 + 1/(remaining_after + epsilon)). But again, this is speculative.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the first approach of filled_after / (remaining_after + epsilon) is a solid heuristic. Let's proceed with that.

So the code would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = remaining_after >= 0
    filled_after = 1 - remaining_after  # since filled_after = (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item)) = 1 - bins_remain_cap + item = (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item
    epsilon = 1e-9
    scores = np.where(valid, filled_after / (remaining_after + epsilon), -np.inf)
    return scores

Wait, but filled_after is 1 - remaining_after. Let's check with an example. Suppose bins_remain_cap is 0.5, item is 0.3. Then remaining_after is 0.2. filled_after is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. Which is correct. So yes.

But what if the bin's remaining capacity is 0.3, and the item is 0.3. Then remaining_after is 0.0. filled_after is 1.0. So the score is 1.0 / (0.0 + 1e-9) = 1e9. Which is very high. That's correct because this bin is perfectly filled.

Another example: bin_remain_cap is 0.4, item is 0.3. remaining_after is 0.1. filled_after is 0.9. score is 0.9 / 0.1 =9.0.

Yes, this seems to work.

So this priority function would assign higher scores to bins that, after adding the item, have a higher filled to remaining ratio. This should encourage packing items into bins that are closer to being full, thus minimizing the number of bins used.

I think this is a good approach. Let's code it.
