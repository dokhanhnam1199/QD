Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin when a new item arrives, so that the bin with the highest score is chosen. The priority should help minimize the total number of bins used.

First, I remember that common heuristics for bin packing include First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. Best Fit places the item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space, which is good for utilizing space efficiently. But maybe there's a way to improve upon that.

Let me think about the existing priority_v1. It returns all zeros, which probably means it's a placeholder. For v2, I need to come up with a smarter heuristic.

What factors should influence the priority? The item size and the remaining capacity of each bin. The priority should be higher for bins where the item fits well. But also, maybe consider how full the bin would be after adding the item. For example, a bin that would be almost full after adding the item is better because it reduces wasted space.

Wait, but if the item can't fit in a bin, that bin's priority should be very low or negative. So first, I need to check if the bin can accommodate the item. If not, set its priority to -infinity or a very low value so it's not selected.

For bins that can fit the item, the priority could be based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. Let's say, the remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap - item. The smaller this value (i.e., the tighter the fit), the higher the priority. That's the Best Fit approach. So the priority would be -(remaining_cap - item), which is equivalent to (item - remaining_cap), but since higher is better, maybe use the negative of the remaining space after insertion. Wait, no. If the remaining space after insertion is (bin_remain_cap - item), then a smaller value is better. So the priority could be (bin_remain_cap - item) but inverted. So for Best Fit, the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item) but only for bins where bin_remain_cap >= item. Then, the bin with the smallest (bin_remain_cap - item) would have the highest priority. So the priority could be 1/(bin_remain_cap - item + 1e-9) to make smaller values have higher priority. But maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, the priority could be (bin_remain_cap - item) but with a negative sign, so higher values (i.e., smaller remaining space) get higher priority. Wait, no. Let's say bin A has 5 remaining, item is 3. Then after placing, remaining is 2. Bin B has 4 remaining, item is 3. After placing, remaining is 1. So bin B is better. So the priority for each bin would be (bin_remain_cap - item). For bins where bin_remain_cap >= item, the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item). But we want to choose the smallest (bin_remain_cap - item), so the priority should be such that higher values correspond to better fits. Wait, no. Because if (bin_remain_cap - item) is smaller, that's better. So the priority should be -(bin_remain_cap - item), so that the smallest (bin_remain_cap - item) gives the highest priority. For example, bin A's (5-3)=2, priority is -2. Bin B's (4-3)=1, priority is -1. So bin B's priority is higher (-1 > -2), so it's selected. That makes sense. So the priority is -(bin_remain_cap - item) for bins that can fit the item. But for bins that can't fit, we set their priority to -infinity.

But maybe there's a way to combine other factors. For example, also considering how much of the bin is already filled. For instance, a bin that is almost full except for this item might be better to fill up. But that's already captured by the Best Fit approach.

Another idea: prioritize bins that, after adding the item, have the least remaining space. So the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item) but inverted. So for each bin that can fit the item, compute (bin_remain_cap - item), and the bin with the smallest value here (i.e., tightest fit) gets the highest priority. So the priority for each bin is (1 / (bin_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)) if the bin can fit the item, else -infinity. But using 1/(...) would make the smallest (bin_remain_cap - item) have the highest priority. Alternatively, using negative of (bin_remain_cap - item) would also work. For example, if bin_remain_cap - item is 2, then priority is -2. If it's 1, priority is -1. So the bin with the smallest (bin_remain_cap - item) has the highest priority (since -1 is higher than -2). So the priority can be (bin_remain_cap - item) * -1. But then, bins that can't fit the item would have a priority of -infinity.

Wait, but in code, how to handle that. Let's see. For each bin in bins_remain_cap, check if the remaining capacity is >= item. If yes, compute the priority as (bin_remain_cap - item) * -1. If not, assign a very low value. So in code:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But wait, that would make the priority for a bin that can fit the item equal to -(remaining - item) = item - remaining. Wait, no. Let's see: bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So remaining_cap - item is the space left after adding the item. We want the smallest space left. So the priority is (remaining_cap - item) * -1. So higher values (i.e., when remaining_cap - item is small) get higher priority. For example, if remaining_cap is 3 and item is 2, remaining_cap - item is 1. The priority is -1. If another bin has remaining_cap 2 and item is 2, remaining_cap - item is 0. Priority is 0. So the second bin has higher priority. So the code would assign the priority as -(remaining_cap - item) for valid bins, and -inf otherwise.

But maybe there's a better way. Another approach is to use the remaining capacity after placing the item. For example, the priority could be (1 - (remaining_cap - item)/bin_capacity), but that's assuming bin_capacity is fixed. Wait, but the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the total capacity of each bin is fixed (say, 1, if normalized). So the remaining capacity after placing the item is (remaining_cap - item). The idea is to maximize the used space. So the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) is the wasted space. So we want to minimize that. So the priority is the negative of that. So same as before.

But perhaps there's a more sophisticated approach. For example, combining the Best Fit with some look-ahead. But since it's online, we can't look ahead. So maybe we can use a heuristic that not only considers the current fit but also how the remaining space could be used for future items.

Wait, but in online BPP, you don't know future items. So the heuristic has to be based on current information. One possible heuristic is to prefer bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity that is as small as possible but also a size that is less likely to be useful. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining space is very small (like 0.1), that's good. But if the remaining space is 0.5, maybe that's better than 0.3, because 0.5 can fit more items in the future. Hmm, but this is conflicting. Because if you leave 0.5, maybe you can fit a 0.5 item later, but if you leave 0.3, maybe you can fit a 0.3 item. But in online, you don't know. So perhaps the Best Fit is better because it minimizes the wasted space now.

Alternatively, some heuristics like the "Almost Worst Fit" which tries to leave larger gaps for future items. But that's the opposite of Best Fit.

But the problem is that the user wants a priority function. So perhaps the Best Fit is a good starting point. But maybe we can enhance it.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is closest to the average item size seen so far. But since we don't track the average in the function, that's not possible. The function only has access to the current item and the bins' remaining capacities.

Alternatively, we can use a combination of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the current remaining capacity. For example, a weighted sum of (remaining_cap - item) and the current remaining capacity. But I'm not sure.

Wait, here's a thought. Suppose we have two bins: bin A has 0.6 remaining, bin B has 0.5 remaining. The item is 0.4. If we place it in bin A, remaining becomes 0.2. If in bin B, 0.1. Best Fit would choose bin B. But maybe bin A's remaining after placement (0.2) is better than 0.1, because 0.2 is a more common item size. But again, without knowing future items, it's hard to say. So perhaps Best Fit is still better.

So perhaps the priority_v2 should implement the Best Fit heuristic. Let's code that.

But wait, the existing code returns all zeros. So the user wants a better version. So for v2, the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    # For each bin, if it can fit the item, compute the remaining space after placing the item. The priority is the negative of that (so smaller remaining space has higher priority). Bins that can't fit get -inf.
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # For bins that can fit, priority is -(remaining_after), so higher is better. For others, -inf.
    scores = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return scores

Yes, that's the Best Fit approach. But maybe there's a better way. Let's think of other heuristics.

Another approach is to use the "First Fit" which selects the first bin that can fit the item. But that's not a priority-based approach. The priority would be based on the order of the bins. But since the priority function returns a score for each bin, the First Fit would assign higher priority to earlier bins. But that's not dynamic. So perhaps not useful here.

Alternatively, the Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining space after placement. That would spread out the items more, possibly leaving larger gaps for future items. The priority for Worst Fit would be (bins_remain_cap - item) for bins that can fit. The bin with the largest (bins_remain_cap - item) would be chosen. So the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) for valid bins, else -inf.

But the user wants a priority function that's better than the trivial one. So perhaps combining Best Fit with some other factors.

Wait, here's a research idea: the "Best Fit" is known to perform better than Worst Fit in many cases. So perhaps implementing Best Fit is a good start. But maybe there's a way to improve it.

Another idea: consider the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item's size. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.5 and the item is 0.3, then after placing, the remaining is 0.2. The sum before placement is 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8. But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item divided by the bin's total capacity. For example, if the bin's total capacity is 1 (normalized), then the remaining after placement is (remaining_cap - item). The priority could be 1 - (remaining_cap - item), which is the utilized space. So higher utilized space is better. But that's the same as (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = (1 - remaining_cap + item) = (item + (1 - remaining_cap)). But 1 - remaining_cap is the used space before adding the item. So the priority would be item + used_space. But that's not sure. For example, if a bin has used space 0.5 (remaining 0.5), and the item is 0.3. After adding, used space is 0.8. The priority would be 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8. Another bin with used space 0.6 (remaining 0.4) and item 0.3 would have priority 0.3 + 0.6 = 0.9. So this bin would be chosen, which is better because after adding, the used space is 0.9. So this approach would prioritize bins that, after adding the item, have higher total used space. Which is the same as Best Fit. Because the used space after is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - remaining_cap + item. So the priority is (1 - remaining_cap + item) for valid bins. But this is equivalent to (item - remaining_cap + 1). But since remaining_cap is the current remaining, the priority is (1 + item - remaining_cap). But for valid bins, remaining_cap >= item. So (1 + item - remaining_cap) would be 1 + (item - remaining_cap). But since remaining_cap >= item, (item - remaining_cap) is <=0. So this would be 1 minus (remaining_cap - item). So the priority is higher when (remaining_cap - item) is smaller, which is the same as Best Fit. So this approach is equivalent to Best Fit.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit is the way to go. But maybe there's a variation. For example, adding a tie-breaker when two bins have the same remaining after placement. For example, prefer the bin with the smaller current remaining capacity. But in Best Fit, the remaining after is the same, so the tie-breaker is not needed. But in code, the priority would be the same for those bins, and the code would pick the first one (since numpy's argmax returns the first occurrence of the maximum value). So perhaps the code as written for Best Fit is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe we can add a secondary factor. For example, when two bins have the same remaining after placement, prefer the one that has a larger current remaining capacity. Wait, but why? Let's say two bins have remaining after placement of 0.2. One had a remaining of 0.5 (item was 0.3), the other had 0.3 (item was 0.1). After placement, both have 0.2. But the first bin had more space before. Maybe the second bin is better because it was already more filled. But I'm not sure. Maybe this doesn't matter. So perhaps the Best Fit is sufficient.

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    scores = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return scores

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think of another heuristic. For example, the "Almost Best Fit" which tries to leave a small but non-zero space. But how to quantify that.

Alternatively, the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining space after placement. So 1/(remaining_after + epsilon). This way, smaller remaining_after gives higher priority. But this is similar to the Best Fit approach. For example, if remaining_after is 0.1, the reciprocal is 10. If it's 0.2, reciprocal is 5. So the bin with 0.1 would have higher priority. But in code, using 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9) would give higher scores to smaller remaining_after. But then, the code would be:

scores = np.where(can_fit, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)

But this would have the same effect as the previous approach, since the reciprocal is a monotonic function. However, using 1/... might lead to very large numbers, but in practice, when comparing, the order is the same as using -remaining_after. So both approaches are equivalent in terms of selecting the same bin. So the code can be written either way.

But the first approach (using -remaining_after) is simpler and more efficient. So I'll proceed with that.

Another possible heuristic: consider the square of the remaining_after. For example, - (remaining_after ** 2). This would penalize larger remaining spaces more. For example, a remaining_after of 0.2 would have a score of -0.04, while 0.1 would be -0.01. The difference between them is larger than in the linear case. This might encourage even tighter packing. But I'm not sure if this is better. It's a variation of Best Fit but with a different scoring.

Alternatively, the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) * bins_remain_cap. This combines the remaining after placement with the current remaining capacity. For example, a bin with higher current remaining capacity and a tight fit would have a higher score. But this might not be optimal. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.5 and the item is 0.3, the remaining after is 0.2. The product is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Another bin with remaining 0.4 and item 0.3, remaining after is 0.1. Product is 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04. So the first bin would have higher priority. But the remaining after is 0.2 vs 0.1. So this approach would prefer the first bin, which leaves more space. That's worse than Best Fit. So this might not be a good idea.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit is the best approach here. Let's proceed with that.

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # For bins that can fit, priority is negative of remaining_after (so smaller remaining_after is better)
    # For bins that can't fit, set to -infinity
    scores = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return scores

But wait, the problem says that the function returns a priority score for each bin, and the bin with the highest score is selected. So in this code, the bin with the smallest remaining_after (i.e., the tightest fit) will have the highest score (since -remaining_after is largest when remaining_after is smallest). So this correctly implements Best Fit.

Yes, this should work. Let's test with an example. Suppose bins_remain_cap is [0.5, 0.4, 0.3], and item is 0.3. The remaining_after for each bin is [0.2, 0.1, 0.0]. The scores would be [-0.2, -0.1, -0.0]. Wait, no. Wait, the code uses -remaining_after, so for the third bin, remaining_after is 0.0, so score is 0.0. The second bin's score is -0.1, first is -0.2. So the third bin has the highest score (0.0), which is correct. So the item is placed in the third bin, which is the best fit.

Another example: bins_remain_cap [0.6, 0.5], item 0.4. Remaining_after is 0.2 and 0.1. Scores are -0.2 and -0.1. So the second bin has higher score (-0.1 > -0.2), so it's selected. Correct.

So this code should work. But maybe there's a more sophisticated approach. For example, considering the sum of the item size and the used space. But I think the Best Fit is a solid approach here.

Another possible improvement: if no existing bins can fit the item, a new bin is created. But the code handles that by setting the score to -inf for bins that can't fit, so the new bin would be selected if all existing bins have -inf.

Thus, the code for priority_v2 is as written above.
