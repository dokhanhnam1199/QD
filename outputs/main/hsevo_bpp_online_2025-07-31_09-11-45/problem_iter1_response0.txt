Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online Bin Packing Problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin when a new item arrives, so that the bin with the highest score is chosen. Let's think about different heuristics that could work here.

The first version just returns zeros, which isn't helpful. So for v2, I should come up with a smarter strategy. Common heuristics for bin packing include First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, etc. Best Fit places the item in the bin that leaves the least space left, which minimizes wasted space. But maybe there's a way to combine different factors.

Wait, the priority function needs to return a score for each bin. The bin must have enough remaining capacity to fit the item. So first, I should set the priority of bins that can't fit the item to a very low value, like negative infinity, so they're not selected.

Then, for bins that can fit the item, how to calculate the score. Let's think about Best Fit: the priority would be the remaining capacity after placing the item. The smaller the remaining space, the better. So the score could be (remaining_cap - item), and we want to maximize that. Wait, no, because Best Fit picks the bin with the smallest remaining space after placement. So the priority should be -(remaining_cap - item), so that the highest priority (most positive) is the one with the least remaining space. Or maybe the score is (remaining_cap - item) but we take the negative. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine multiple factors. For example, considering both the remaining capacity after placing the item and the current utilization of the bin. Another idea is to prioritize bins that have higher existing utilization but still can fit the item. So if a bin has a remaining capacity just enough for the item, that's ideal.

Wait, let's formalize this. For each bin, if the remaining capacity is >= item, then the possible score could be (remaining_cap - item) which is the waste. We want to minimize this waste, so higher priority for lower waste. So the priority could be 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) to make lower waste have higher scores. But division might lead to very high values when the waste is near zero. Alternatively, the negative of the waste, so that the highest value (least waste) is chosen. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item). That way, the bin with the smallest remaining space after placing the item gets the highest priority.

But maybe there's a better way. Another approach is to consider the current remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity that's just enough for the item, that's perfect. So the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item. Wait, no, because if the remaining capacity after is zero, that's the best. So the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) which is the new remaining capacity. But we want to minimize that. So higher priority for lower values. So the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) but inverted. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a combination of the current remaining capacity and the new remaining capacity. For example, a bin that is already more full might be preferred to place the item if it fits, to fill it up. But how to translate that into a score.

Another idea: the score could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the new remaining capacity. Wait, not sure. Let's think of Best Fit as (remaining_cap - item) and we want the smallest possible. So the priority for each bin is (remaining_cap - item) if the bin can fit the item, else -infinity. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) would be selected. But since we need to return a priority score where higher is better, the priority should be the negative of (remaining_cap - item). So the code would compute for each bin: if the bin can fit the item, then -(remaining_cap - item), else -infinity. That way, the bin with the smallest remaining space after placing the item (i.e., the best fit) has the highest priority.

Wait, let's test this. Suppose bin A has remaining capacity 5, and the item is 3. Then remaining after is 2. Bin B has remaining 4, item is 3, remaining after is 1. So bin B is better. The priority for A would be -2, for B -1. Wait, no, because if we take -(remaining_cap - item), then for bin A, it's -(5-3) = -2, for bin B -(4-3) = -1. So higher priority (more negative is worse). Wait, that's not right. Because we want the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) to have the highest priority. So if we use (remaining_cap - item) as the score, then the bin with the smallest value would be the best. But since the priority function returns a score where higher is better, we need to invert the sign. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item). Wait, no. Let's see: if (remaining_cap - item) is 2 for bin A and 1 for bin B, then bin B is better. The priority for A is -2, for B is -1. So B has higher priority (since -1 > -2). So the code would select bin B. That's correct. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit the item. So that's the Best Fit approach.

But maybe there's a better heuristic. For example, some heuristics consider the sum of the squares of the used space. Or other metrics. Let's think of another approach. For example, the "Almost Full" heuristic: prioritize bins that, after adding the item, are as full as possible. That's similar to Best Fit. Alternatively, the "Worst Fit" heuristic would place the item in the bin with the most remaining space after placement, which is the opposite. But Worst Fit is generally worse for bin packing.

Alternatively, a hybrid approach. For example, prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is as small as possible, but also considering the current utilization. For example, a bin that is 80% full and can fit the item might be better than a bin that is 50% full and can fit the item. But how to combine these.

Another idea: the priority could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the new remaining capacity. Wait, not sure. Let's think of a different approach. Maybe the priority is the current remaining capacity of the bin. So if a bin has a remaining capacity that is exactly equal to the item size, that's the best. So the priority could be the negative of the absolute difference between the remaining capacity and the item. So bins that fit the item exactly get the highest score. For example, if the item is 3, a bin with remaining 3 gets a priority of 0 (since 3-3=0, absolute is 0, negative is 0). Wait, but if the remaining capacity is larger than the item, then the absolute difference is (remaining_cap - item). So the priority would be -abs(remaining_cap - item). So the bin that exactly fits the item (remaining_cap == item) would have the highest priority (0), then bins with remaining_cap slightly larger than the item would have lower (more negative) priorities. But this would prioritize exact fits first, then the next best fit. But this is similar to Best Fit, but with a different scoring.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) if the bin can fit the item, else -infinity. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) is selected. But since higher priority is better, we need to invert the sign. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item). That's the same as Best Fit.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let's think of a heuristic that combines Best Fit with some other factors. For example, considering the current utilization of the bin. Suppose a bin is already 90% full, and adding the item would make it 95% full. Another bin is 50% full, adding the item would make it 55% full. The first bin is better because it's closer to being full. So the priority could be the sum of the current utilization and the new utilization. Or perhaps the new utilization (after adding the item) is the main factor.

Wait, the new utilization would be (original_remaining_cap - item) / bin_size. Wait, but the bin_size is fixed. Since the problem is online, the bin_size is fixed, but the code doesn't have that as a parameter. Wait, the bins_remain_cap array gives the remaining capacity of each bin. So the original capacity of each bin is fixed (say, 1.0 if normalized), and bins_remain_cap is the remaining. So the current used space is (original_cap - remaining_cap). But the code doesn't have the original capacity. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the priority function only has the remaining capacities, not the original bin sizes. Wait, but in the online BPP, all bins have the same fixed capacity. So the original capacity is the same for all bins, say C. So the remaining capacity is C - sum of items in the bin. So the original capacity is C, but the code doesn't have access to C. Wait, but the code is given the bins_remain_cap array, which is the remaining capacities. So the original capacity is not known. So the priority function can't use the original capacity. So any heuristic that depends on the original capacity (like utilization percentages) can't be implemented because the code doesn't have that information. Wait, but that's a problem. Because if the original capacity is not known, how can we compute utilization?

Wait, perhaps the original capacity is the same for all bins, but the code is not given that value. So the priority function can't use it. So any heuristic that requires knowing the original bin capacity (like calculating utilization) can't be implemented. Therefore, the priority function can only use the remaining capacities and the item size.

So given that, the heuristics must be based on the remaining capacities and the item size. So for example, Best Fit is possible because it's based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. Let's re-express Best Fit: for each bin, if the remaining capacity is >= item, then the new remaining capacity is (remaining_cap - item). The Best Fit heuristic selects the bin with the smallest new remaining capacity. So the priority for each bin is (remaining_cap - item) if the bin can fit the item, else -infinity. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) is chosen. But since higher priority is better, the priority should be the negative of (remaining_cap - item). So the code would compute:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But wait, -(remaining_cap - item) is equivalent to (item - remaining_cap). So the priority is (item - remaining_cap) for bins that can fit the item. So the higher the value, the better. For example, if a bin has remaining_cap 3 and item is 2, then (2-3) = -1. Wait, no. Wait, if the bin's remaining capacity is 3, and the item is 2, then after placing the item, the remaining capacity is 1. So the (remaining_cap - item) is 1, and the priority is -1. But that's not correct. Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:

If the bin's remaining capacity is 3, and the item is 2, then the new remaining capacity is 3 - 2 = 1. The Best Fit heuristic would prefer the bin where this value is smallest. So for two bins, one with new remaining 1 and another with 0.5, the second is better. So the priority for the first bin is -1, for the second is -0.5. Wait, but higher priority is better. So the second bin's priority is higher (-0.5 is higher than -1). So the code would select the bin with the smallest new remaining capacity. So this approach works.

But perhaps there's a better way. Let's think of another heuristic. For example, the "First Fit" heuristic would place the item in the first bin that can fit it. But that's not a priority-based approach. The priority for First Fit would be the order of the bins, but since the priority function can't track the order, perhaps it's not applicable here.

Another idea: the "Most Full" heuristic. For each bin that can fit the item, the priority is the current remaining capacity. The lower the remaining capacity (i.e., the more full the bin is), the higher the priority. So the priority is (original_remaining_cap - item) is not considered here. Wait, but the current remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap. So for a bin that is already more full (lower remaining capacity), but can fit the item, the priority is higher. So the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) must be >=0. So the priority is (original_remaining_cap - (bins_remain_cap - item))? No, perhaps not. Wait, the current remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap. The item is added to the bin, so the new remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap - item. But the priority could be based on the current remaining capacity (before adding the item). For example, a bin that is more full (smaller remaining capacity) but can fit the item would have higher priority. So the priority is (original_remaining_cap - (bins_remain_cap - item))? No, perhaps not. Wait, the current remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap. So the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) as before. Or perhaps the current remaining capacity (before adding the item) is considered. For example, a bin with a remaining capacity of 5 and item 3 would have a new remaining of 2. Another bin with remaining 4 and item 3 would have new remaining 1. The Best Fit would choose the second. But if we use the current remaining capacity, the first bin has higher remaining (5 vs 4), but after adding the item, the new remaining is 2 vs 1. So the current remaining capacity isn't directly useful here.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the way to go. But let's think of another possible heuristic. For example, the "Best Fit with Tie Breaker". If two bins have the same remaining capacity after placing the item, perhaps prefer the one that has a higher current remaining capacity. But how to encode that.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of the new remaining capacity and the current remaining capacity. For example, the priority could be (current_remaining_cap) * (new_remaining_cap). But I'm not sure. Let's see: if a bin has current_remaining_cap 5, item 3, new_remaining is 2. Another bin has current_remaining 4, item 3, new_remaining 1. The product for the first is 5*2=10, the second is 4*1=4. So the first would have higher priority, which is not what Best Fit would do. So this might not be a good approach.

Another idea: the priority is the negative of the new remaining capacity. So the code would be:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

This way, the bin with the smallest new remaining capacity (best fit) has the highest priority (since -1 is higher than -2). So this is the Best Fit heuristic.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think of a heuristic that tries to leave bins with remaining capacities that are as large as possible, to accommodate future items. Wait, that's the opposite of Best Fit. For example, Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining capacity after placement. But that's generally worse for bin packing. But perhaps in some cases, it's better. But according to the problem statement, we need to minimize the number of bins, so Best Fit is better.

So the priority_v2 could implement the Best Fit heuristic. Let's code that.

But wait, the code needs to return a priority score for each bin. So for each bin, if the bin can fit the item, the priority is -(remaining_cap - item), else -infinity. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item
    after_add = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Check if the item can fit
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # For bins that can fit, priority is the negative of the new remaining capacity (so higher is better)
    # For bins that can't fit, set priority to -infinity
    scores = np.where(can_fit, -after_add, -np.inf)
    return scores

Wait, but in this case, the priority is the negative of (remaining_cap - item). So for a bin that can fit the item, the score is -(remaining_cap - item) = item - remaining_cap. Wait, no. Let's see: after_add is bins_remain_cap - item. So the new remaining capacity is after_add. The priority is -after_add. So the smaller the after_add (i.e., the better the fit), the higher the priority. For example, if after_add is 1, the score is -1. If after_add is 0.5, the score is -0.5. So the bin with after_add 0.5 has a higher score (-0.5 is greater than -1). So this correctly implements Best Fit.

Yes, this should work. So the code for priority_v2 would be as above.

But perhaps there's a more sophisticated approach. For example, combining Best Fit with some other factors. For example, considering the number of items already in the bin. But the code doesn't have access to that information. It only has the remaining capacities.

Another idea: the priority could be the reciprocal of the new remaining capacity. So bins with smaller new remaining capacity have higher scores. For example, 1/(after_add + 1e-9). But this could lead to very large numbers when after_add is near zero. But in that case, the bin is almost full, which is good. So the code would be:

scores = np.where(can_fit, 1/(after_add + 1e-9), -np.inf)

This would also prioritize bins with the smallest after_add. But this might be more sensitive to small differences. For example, a bin with after_add 0.1 would have a score of 10, while a bin with after_add 0.2 would have 5. So the first is prioritized. This is similar to Best Fit but with a different scaling. However, using reciprocals might lead to numerical issues, but adding a small epsilon (1e-9) helps prevent division by zero.

Alternatively, using the negative of after_add (as in the previous approach) is simpler and avoids division. So which is better? Both would result in the same bin selection, as the order of the scores would be the same. For example, if after_add is 0.5 and 1.0, the first approach gives -0.5 and -1.0, so the first is higher. The reciprocal approach gives 2 and 1, so the first is higher. So both approaches would select the same bins. The difference is in the actual score values, but since the selection is based on the maximum, the outcome is the same. So the first approach (using -after_add) is more straightforward and avoids potential numerical issues.

Therefore, the code for priority_v2 can be written as:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    after_add = bins_remain_cap - item
    scores = np.where(can_fit, -after_add, -np.inf)
    return scores

But wait, what if there are no bins that can fit the item? Then all scores are -inf, and the code would have to create a new bin. But that's handled outside the priority function. The priority function's job is to return the scores, and the selection process would pick the highest. If all are -inf, then a new bin is created.

This should correctly implement the Best Fit heuristic. So this is a good candidate for priority_v2.

Alternatively, another heuristic could be to prioritize bins that, after adding the item, have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if future items are expected to be of certain sizes, but in online BPP, we don't know future items. So that's not applicable.

Another idea: the "Almost Worst Fit" heuristic, which tries to leave a remaining capacity that is as large as possible but not too large. But again, without knowing future items, this is hard.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after adding the item, but with a penalty for bins that are almost full. For example, if after adding the item, the remaining capacity is very small (like 0.1), maybe that's good. But if it's 0.5, maybe that's better for future items. But this is speculative.

But given the problem constraints, the Best Fit heuristic is a solid choice. So the code for priority_v2 would implement Best Fit as described.
