Okay, I need to create an improved priority_v2 function by combining elements from the better (v0) and worse (v1) versions, based on the analysis provided. Let me start by understanding what made v0 better and v1 worse.

From the analysis, the better code (v0) uses a geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, which creates synergy between tight packing and future flexibility. It also adds a perfection bonus for exact fits. The worse code (v1) introduces unnecessary complexity like dynamic exponents, non-linear scaling, and alignment bonuses that might add noise.

The key points from the analysis are that top heuristics balance simplicity with precision-tuned components. They avoid overengineering. So, I should take the best parts of v0 and maybe incorporate any useful elements from v1 that don't add too much complexity.

Looking at v0's approach: fill efficiency is item/bin capacity, residual potential is sqrt of remaining space. Then geometric mean of these. Also, a perfection bonus for exact fits.

v1 tried things like dynamic residual exponents and alignment bonuses, but those were overcomplicated. However, maybe the perfection bonus in v1 is size-proportional, which could be better. In v0, the perfection bonus is a fixed 2.0, while v1 uses (2.5 + 3*item). The analysis mentioned that v1's perfection bonus has size-proportional reward, which might be a good idea if calibrated properly.

But the analysis also said that the best heuristics use calibrated constants. So perhaps combining the geometric mean approach from v0 with a size-proportional perfection bonus from v1, but in a simpler way.

Another point from the analysis: avoid overparameterization. So, I should keep the core elements of v0 but maybe adjust the perfection bonus to be item-dependent, as that could better prioritize exact fits for larger items, which are harder to place.

Wait, in v0, the perfection bonus is a fixed 2.0 when remaining_after is close to zero. In v1, it's (2.5 + 3*item). Maybe using a scaled version of the item size for the bonus would help. For example, larger items that exactly fit a bin should get a higher bonus because placing them perfectly is more critical.

But I need to ensure that the scaling is not arbitrary. The analysis mentioned that v1's alignment bonus (0.4 * exp(...)) was unnecessary. So, perhaps the perfection bonus should be item-dependent but in a simple way.

So, the plan is:

1. Keep the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential (from v0).
2. Use a size-proportional perfection bonus (from v1) but with calibrated constants.
3. Avoid other complexities like dynamic exponents or alignment bonuses.

Also, ensure numerical stability with epsilons, as in v0.

Let me outline the steps:

- Calculate remaining_after as before.
- valid_mask for bins that can fit the item.
- fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps)
- residual_potential = sqrt(remaining_after + eps)
- synergy_score = sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential) (geometric mean)
- perfection_bonus: check if remaining_after is close to zero, then apply a bonus that's proportional to the item size. Maybe something like 1.0 + item, but need to calibrate. The v1 used 2.5 + 3*item, which might be too aggressive. Maybe a smaller multiplier.

Wait, in v0, the perfection_bonus is 2.0. In v1, it's (2.5 + 3*item). The analysis said that v0's approach was better, but perhaps combining the idea of a size-proportional bonus with a reasonable constant. For example, 1.0 * (1 + item), but need to test. However, since the analysis mentioned that the best heuristics use calibrated constants, maybe using a fixed bonus plus a scaled item part. But how to avoid overcomplicating?

Alternatively, perhaps the perfection bonus should be higher for larger items because fitting them exactly is more beneficial. So, the bonus could be a base value plus a multiplier based on the item's size. For example, 1.5 + 2*item. But need to ensure that this doesn't dominate the synergy score.

But the analysis also mentioned that the worse code had "perfection_bonus with size-proportional reward" which was part of the overengineering. Wait, the analysis said that the better code uses a "precision-aware exact fit bonus" while the worse code's perfection bonus was "size-proportional reward" which was part of the noise. So maybe the better approach is to keep the perfection bonus as a fixed value, as in v0.

Hmm, the analysis says that the better heuristic (v0) uses a "precision-aware exact fit bonus (better than ==0 for floating point)" while the worse code (v1) has "perfection_bonus with size-proportional reward" which is part of the overengineered features. So perhaps the size-proportional part is not helpful and adds noise. Therefore, the perfection bonus should remain a fixed value when there's an exact fit.

Therefore, in v2, I should retain the geometric mean approach from v0 and the fixed perfection bonus. But maybe adjust the residual potential calculation. Wait, in v0, residual potential is sqrt(remaining_after), which encourages leaving space that's a square, thus preferring mid-sized residuals. That's a good approach.

Another thought: the analysis mentioned that the best heuristics use "focused geometric mean" and "calibrated constants". So perhaps the core of v0 is solid. However, maybe the residual potential could be adjusted. For example, instead of sqrt, use a different function, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, the analysis said that v0's residual potential uses sqrt for mid-sized items, which is good.

So, the main elements to keep from v0 are:

- fill_efficiency = item / bin_capacity
- residual_potential = sqrt(remaining_after)
- synergy_score = sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)
- fixed perfection_bonus for exact fits.

The v1's problem was adding dynamic exponents, alignment bonuses, etc. So, to improve upon v0, perhaps the only adjustment is to the perfection bonus. Alternatively, maybe the residual potential could be adjusted slightly, but not in a complex way.

Wait, the analysis also mentioned that "adaptive weight balancing and residual forecasting can help, but requires careful calibration". So maybe a simple adjustment to the residual potential. For example, instead of sqrt, use a cube root or another function. But that's a risk. Alternatively, maybe the residual potential could be remaining_after raised to a power that's a function of the item size. But that's what v1 did with dynamic exponents, which was considered overengineered.

Alternatively, perhaps the residual potential could be remaining_after squared, but that would penalize larger residuals more. Wait, the sqrt in v0 makes the residual potential higher for mid-sized remaining capacities, which might be better for future items. So, perhaps keeping sqrt is better.

So, the main idea is to stick with v0's approach but perhaps enhance the perfection bonus. Alternatively, maybe the fill efficiency could be adjusted. For example, in v0, fill_efficiency is item/(bin_capacity), which measures how much the item fills the bin. But maybe for larger items, this is more important, so weighting it more. However, the geometric mean already balances the two factors.

Alternatively, the analysis mentioned that the better code uses "geometric mean for synergy", which is better than additive or multiplicative combinations. So, the synergy_score in v0 is good.

So, perhaps the only improvement is to adjust the perfection bonus. In v0, it's a fixed 2.0. Maybe making it a bit higher or scaling with the item's size in a simple way. But the analysis said that the worse code's size-proportional bonus was part of the problem. So, perhaps keeping it fixed is better.

Alternatively, maybe the perfection bonus could be a function of the item size, but in a way that's not too complex. For example, 1.0 + item. But if the item is 0.5, then the bonus is 1.5. If the item is 0.8, the bonus is 1.8. This would give a higher bonus for larger items that exactly fit, which makes sense because placing a larger item exactly is more critical. However, this introduces a dependency on the item size, which might be acceptable if it's a simple linear relationship.

But the analysis mentioned that the worse code's perfection bonus had "size-proportional reward" which was part of the overengineering. So, perhaps this is not a good idea. Therefore, the perfection bonus should remain a fixed value.

Alternatively, maybe the bonus could be scaled by the item's size in a calibrated way. For example, if the item is large, the bonus is higher. Let's say the bonus is 3.0 * item. But then, for an item of size 0.9, the bonus would be 2.7, which is higher than the fixed 2.0 in v0. But how to determine the multiplier? This requires calibration, which the analysis says is important.

But without testing, it's hard to know. However, the user is asking for an improved version based on the analysis. The analysis says that the best heuristics use "calibrated constants" and avoid "overparameterization". So, perhaps a small adjustment to the perfection bonus to make it item-dependent but in a simple, calibrated way.

Alternatively, maybe the perfection bonus in v0 is sufficient. The analysis said that the better code's bonus was "better than ==0 for floating point", which is handled with np.isclose.

So, perhaps the main improvement is to combine the geometric mean approach of v0 with a slightly adjusted perfection bonus. Alternatively, maybe introduce a minor element from v1 that's not overcomplicated.

Wait, the analysis mentioned that "adaptive weight balancing and residual forecasting can help, but requires careful calibration". So, perhaps a simple adaptive element. For example, the residual potential could be raised to a power that's a function of the item size, but in a very simple way. For instance, if the item is large, the residual potential is more important, so the exponent could be lower (making the residual potential higher for larger remaining_after). But this is getting into dynamic exponents, which was part of v1's problem.

Alternatively, maybe the residual potential could be remaining_after multiplied by (1 + item), which would give more weight to residual space when the item is larger. But again, this adds complexity.

Hmm. The key is to keep it simple but effective. The analysis says that the best heuristics are simple with precision-tuned components. So, perhaps the main elements of v0 are already good, and the improvement is to adjust the perfection bonus to be item-dependent in a simple way.

Let me try this: in v0, the perfection bonus is 2.0. Let's make it 2.0 + item. This way, larger items that exactly fit get a higher bonus. But need to ensure that this doesn't overshadow the synergy score. For example, if the item is 0.9, the bonus becomes 2.9, which is higher than before. But the synergy score is a product of fill efficiency and residual potential. For an exact fit, remaining_after is 0, so residual_potential is sqrt(0 + eps) which is near zero. But fill_efficiency would be item/(bin_capacity) = 0.9 / 0.9 = 1.0. So synergy_score is sqrt(1.0 * 0) = 0. But then the perfection bonus is added, so the total score is 0 + 2.9 = 2.9. Which would be higher than other bins where the item fits but doesn't fill exactly. So this makes sense: exact fits get a high score, and the bonus is higher for larger items.

But wait, in the case of an exact fit, the residual_potential is sqrt(0 + eps) which is very small, so the synergy score would be sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential) = sqrt(1.0 * small_value) = sqrt(small_value), which is near zero. Then adding the perfection bonus (2.9) would make the total score 2.9, which is much higher than other bins. So this would prioritize exact fits, which is correct.

But in v0, the perfection bonus is 2.0, so the total score for exact fits is 2.0. By making it 2.0 + item, larger items get a higher bonus, which could be beneficial. However, this introduces a dependency on the item size. The analysis mentioned that the worse code's "size-proportional reward" was part of the overengineering, but perhaps a simple linear scaling is acceptable if it's calibrated.

Alternatively, maybe the perfection bonus should be a fixed value, as in v0, to avoid overcomplicating. The analysis said that the better code uses a "precision-aware exact fit bonus" which is better than ==0. So perhaps the perfection bonus in v0 is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the perfection bonus can be a function of the bin's remaining capacity before placing the item. For example, if the bin was almost full, and the item exactly fills it, that's better. But that's already captured by fill_efficiency.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to stick with v0's structure but adjust the perfection bonus to be 3.0 instead of 2.0. Or perhaps the perfection bonus in v0 is already optimal. Without testing, it's hard to say, but according to the analysis, the better code uses a fixed bonus.

So, perhaps the main improvement is to retain the v0's approach but add a minor element from v1 that's useful. For example, in v1, the fill_efficiency is raised to the power of sqrt(item + 0.2). But the analysis said that non-linear scaling was part of the problem. So that's probably not a good idea.

Alternatively, the analysis mentioned that "geometric mean of tightness/utilization works better than exponential boosts". So, the synergy score in v0 is good.

Another idea: in v0, the residual potential is sqrt(remaining_after). Maybe using a different function, like remaining_after^0.7, which is between linear and sqrt. But this would require calibration and might complicate things. However, the analysis says that simplicity is key.

Alternatively, the residual potential could be remaining_after, but that would prioritize bins with more remaining space, which might not be ideal. The sqrt in v0 is a compromise, encouraging some remaining space for future items.

So, after considering all this, the best approach is to take the core of v0 (geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, fixed perfection bonus) and perhaps adjust the perfection bonus to be slightly higher or include a small item-dependent component, but in a simple way.

Let me draft the code:

def priority_v2(...):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps)
    residual_potential = sqrt(remaining_after + eps)
    synergy_score = sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)
    # Perfection bonus: if exact fit, add a bonus. Maybe 2.0 + item * 0.5
    perfection_bonus = np.isclose(...) * (2.0 + 0.5 * item)
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score + perfection_bonus, -inf)
    return scores

This way, the perfection bonus is 2.0 plus half the item's size. For a large item of 0.9, the bonus is 2.45, which is higher than v0's 2.0. This could help prioritize exact fits for larger items without overcomplicating the bonus. The multiplier 0.5 is arbitrary but a small value to avoid dominating the synergy score.

Alternatively, the analysis might prefer a fixed bonus. But the user wants to combine elements from both versions. Since v1's perfection bonus was size-proportional but overengineered, a simpler version could be better.

Another consideration: in v0, the perfection bonus is added to the synergy score. For an exact fit, the synergy score is very low (since residual_potential is near zero), so the perfection bonus is the main contributor. This makes sense because we want to prioritize exact fits regardless of other factors.

In the code above, the perfection bonus is 2.0 + 0.5*item. This is a simple linear scaling. The analysis mentioned that calibrated constants are good, so choosing 0.5 as a multiplier is a calibrated choice. It's a minor adjustment from v0's fixed 2.0.

Thus, the key idea is to maintain the geometric mean synergy score from v0 but enhance the perfection bonus with a simple item-dependent term to favor exact fits for larger items, which are more critical to place correctly.

So, the final code for priority_v2 would look like this, combining the best of v0 with a calibrated adjustment from v1's perfection bonus.
