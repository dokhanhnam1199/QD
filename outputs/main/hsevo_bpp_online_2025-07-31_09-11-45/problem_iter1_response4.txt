Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used, so we want to pack items efficiently.

First, the existing priority_v1 returns all zeros, which isn't helpful. So for priority_v2, I need to come up with a smarter way to assign scores to each bin.

Common heuristics for bin packing include First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. Best Fit places the item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space. That might be a good starting point. But how to translate that into a priority score.

Wait, the priority function returns a score for each bin. The bin with the highest score is chosen. So for Best Fit, the priority would be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but only if the item fits. If the bin can't accommodate the item, the priority should be very low (like negative infinity) so it's not selected.

But maybe we can add some creativity. What if we consider not just the remaining space but also how tightly packed the bin would be? For example, a bin that, after adding the item, has a remaining capacity that's a multiple of a certain value. Or maybe prioritize bins where the remaining space after adding the item is a prime number, which might encourage leaving space for future items that fit well. Hmm, that's a bit out there, but Tesla might think of something like that.

Alternatively, consider combining multiple factors. For example, the score could be a weighted sum of the remaining capacity after placing the item and how full the bin would be. Or maybe prioritize bins that are almost full but can still take the item, thus reducing fragmentation.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining space after placing the item. So bins that have the smallest remaining space (but non-negative) get the highest priority. That's essentially Best Fit. Let's see: for each bin, if the remaining capacity is >= item size, then the priority is (remaining_cap - item). But wait, Best Fit would choose the bin with the smallest remaining space after placing the item. So the priority should be (remaining_cap - item) if possible, but higher values are better. Wait, no. If we want the smallest remaining space, then the priority should be -(remaining_cap - item), so that the smallest value (most negative) becomes the highest priority. Wait, no. Because in the priority function, higher scores are better. So for Best Fit, the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) if the item fits, else -infinity. Then the bin with the highest priority (i.e., the smallest remaining space) is chosen.

But how to implement that. Let's see. For each bin in bins_remain_cap, check if the bin can take the item (i.e., bin_remain >= item). If yes, compute (bin_remain - item) and take the negative of that, so that the smallest remaining space (after placing the item) gives the highest priority. Wait, no. Let's say after placing the item, the remaining space is 0. That's the best case. So the priority for that bin would be 0. If another bin has remaining space 1 after placing the item, then priority is 1. Wait, but higher priority is better, so the bin with 0 would have higher priority than 1. Wait, no. If the priority is (remaining_cap - item), then for a bin that can exactly fit the item, the remaining space is 0. So the priority would be 0. For a bin that has more space, say 2, then the priority is 2. But we want the bin with the smallest remaining space. So higher priority would be worse here. So perhaps the priority should be the negative of (remaining_cap - item). Then, the bin with the smallest remaining space (after placing the item) would have the highest (most negative) value. Wait, but in that case, the maximum of the priorities would be the one with the smallest (remaining_cap - item). Wait, no. Let's see: if a bin has remaining capacity 5 and the item is 3, then after placing, remaining is 2. So (5-3) = 2. The negative is -2. Another bin with remaining 4 and item 3: (4-3)=1, negative is -1. So the second bin's priority is -1, which is higher than -2. So the second bin would be chosen, which is correct because it leaves 1 unit, which is better. Wait, but the first bin leaves 2, the second leaves 1. So the second is better. So the priority for the second bin is -1, which is higher than -2. So the maximum priority is -1, so that bin is selected. That works. So the priority is (remaining_cap - item) if the item fits, else -infinity. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) (i.e., the best fit) will have the highest priority (since (remaining_cap - item) is smallest, but when we take the negative, the largest value is the best). Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's say we have two bins:

Bin A: remaining 5, item is 3. After placing, remaining is 2. So (5-3) = 2. The priority is 2. But we want the bin that leaves the least space. So bin B with remaining 4, item 3: (4-3)=1. So priority is 1. So the priority for bin B is higher (1) than bin A (2). Wait, but that's the opposite of what we want. Because bin B leaves 1, which is better. So in this case, the priority should be higher for bin B. But according to this, the priority is 1 for bin B and 2 for bin A. So bin A's priority is higher, which is wrong. So this approach is incorrect.

Ah, right. So the problem is that if we use (remaining_cap - item) as the priority, then higher values (i.e., more remaining space) would have higher priority, which is the opposite of what we want. So instead, we need to invert that. So perhaps the priority is 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) if the item fits. Then, the smaller the remaining space, the higher the priority. Because 1 divided by a smaller number is larger. For example, if remaining is 0, 1/0.000000001 is a very large number. If remaining is 1, then 1/1 = 1. So the bin with 0 remaining would have higher priority. But division by zero is a problem, so adding a small epsilon.

Alternatively, the priority could be (bin_remain_cap - item) but we take the negative. So for bin A, 5-3=2, priority is -2. Bin B, 4-3=1, priority is -1. Then, the maximum priority is -1 (bin B), which is correct. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item) if the item fits. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) (i.e., the best fit) will have the highest priority (since -1 is higher than -2). So that's correct.

So the priority for each bin is:

if bin_remain >= item: priority = -(bin_remain - item)

else: priority = -infinity

But how to implement this in numpy.

So in code:

Compute the possible remaining capacities after placing the item: new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item

Then, for each bin, if new_remain >=0, then the priority is -new_remain. Else, -infinity.

So in numpy:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

priority_scores = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But wait, the Best Fit would select the bin with the smallest new_remain. So by taking the negative, the largest priority (most negative) would be the best. Wait, no. Wait, if new_remain is 0, then the priority is 0. If new_remain is 1, priority is -1. So the bin with new_remain 0 has higher priority (0) than -1. So the maximum priority is 0, which is correct.

Wait, no. Let's see:

If new_remain is 0, then the priority is 0.

If new_remain is 1, priority is -1.

So the maximum between 0 and -1 is 0, so the bin with new_remain 0 is selected. That's correct.

But in the code above, the priority is -(new_remain). So for a bin that can fit the item, the priority is -(new_remain). So the bin with the smallest new_remain (best fit) will have the highest priority (since -(new_remain) is largest when new_remain is smallest).

Yes. For example:

new_remain for bin1 is 0: priority is 0.

new_remain for bin2 is 1: priority is -1.

So bin1 is selected.

Another example: bin1 has new_remain 2, bin2 has 1. Then priorities are -2 and -1. So bin2 is selected (since -1 is higher than -2). Which is correct.

So this correctly implements Best Fit.

But the user wants a creative approach. Maybe Tesla would think of a more nuanced heuristic. For example, considering the square of the remaining space, or other factors.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is a multiple of a certain value, which could be useful for future items. For example, if the remaining space is a prime number, maybe that's better. But that's probably too arbitrary.

Alternatively, consider the sum of the reciprocal of the remaining space. Or perhaps the priority is the remaining capacity of the bin after placing the item, but with a penalty for bins that are almost full. Wait, but that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, combine Best Fit with some other heuristic. For example, if the item is large, prioritize bins that can fit it exactly. Or if the item is small, use a different strategy.

But since the priority function can't look ahead, it has to make decisions based on the current item and existing bins.

Another approach: the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a twist. For example, the priority is (remaining_cap - item) if the bin can fit the item, but multiplied by a factor that depends on how full the bin is. For example, if the bin is almost full after placing the item, that's better. So maybe the priority is (remaining_cap - item) + (1 / (remaining_cap_after + epsilon)), but that might not work.

Wait, perhaps the priority is the sum of the current remaining capacity and the inverse of the remaining after placing the item. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, use a weighted combination of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the current remaining capacity. For example, a balance between Best Fit and something else.

But perhaps the simplest and most effective is the Best Fit approach. But the user wants a creative version. So maybe Tesla would think of a more optimized version.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity. For example, if the item takes up a large portion of the remaining space, that's better. So for a bin with remaining capacity R, the priority is (item / R) if R >= item. So higher values (closer to 1) are better. For example, if R is exactly equal to item, the ratio is 1. If R is larger, the ratio is smaller. So this would prioritize bins where the item fills as much of the remaining space as possible. That's similar to Best Fit but using a ratio.

So in code:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

priority_scores = np.where(mask, item / bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

But wait, if R is 5 and item is 3, then 3/5=0.6. If R is 3, then 3/3=1. So the bin with R=3 (exact fit) gets priority 1, which is the highest. That's correct. This is similar to the Best Fit Decreasing heuristic but applied in an online setting.

This is called the "First Fit Decreasing" if items are sorted, but here it's online. But using the ratio could be a different approach. Let's call this the "Maximal Utilization" heuristic. The priority is the ratio of the item to the bin's remaining capacity. Bins that can fit the item and have the highest ratio (i.e., the item takes up the largest possible portion of the bin's remaining space) are chosen.

So this would also work. Let's compare with Best Fit. For example, if a bin has R=5, item=3: ratio 0.6. Another bin R=4, item=3: ratio 0.75. So the second bin is chosen. Which is better than the first. So this approach also selects the best fit. Wait, but in this case, the ratio is higher when the remaining space is smaller. So this is equivalent to Best Fit. Because the ratio item/R is maximized when R is as small as possible (but >= item). So this is the same as Best Fit. So perhaps this is another way to implement Best Fit.

Hmm. So maybe the user wants a different heuristic. Let's think of other possibilities.

Another heuristic is Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining space after placement. That would spread out the items more. For Worst Fit, the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) if possible, and select the maximum. So the priority is (remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit the item. But that's the opposite of Best Fit.

But the user wants a priority function that's better than the trivial one. So perhaps combining multiple factors.

Alternatively, consider the square of the remaining space after placing the item. For example, priority is -( (remaining_cap - item) ** 2 ). This would penalize larger remaining spaces more, thus preferring bins that leave as little space as possible. But this is similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a combination of the remaining space and the current bin's utilization. For example, the priority could be (current_utilization + item) / bin_size. But bin_size is fixed, so perhaps not.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a bonus for bins that are already more full. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of R, after placing the item, the new remaining is R - item. The priority could be (bin_capacity - (R - item)) which is the total used space. So higher used space is better. So priority = (bin_capacity - (R - item)) if R >= item. This is equivalent to (bin_capacity - R + item) = (item + (bin_capacity - R)). Since bin_capacity is fixed, (bin_capacity - R) is the used space before adding the item. So the priority is (used_space + item). Which is the same as the total used space after adding the item. So this would prioritize bins that, after adding the item, have the highest used space. Which is exactly the Best Fit approach. Because the highest used space implies the smallest remaining space.

So again, this is the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit is the standard approach here. But the user wants a creative version. Maybe Tesla would think of a different approach.

Another angle: consider the harmonic mean or other statistical measures. For example, the priority could be based on how well the remaining space after placing the item aligns with common item sizes. But without knowing future items, this is tricky.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that tries to leave bins with remaining capacities that are multiples of the item size. For example, if the item is size 2, then leaving a remaining space of 4 (which is a multiple of 2) might be better for future items. But this requires knowing future items, which isn't possible in online BPP.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a higher priority if that remaining capacity is a prime number, as primes are less likely to be divided into smaller items. But this is speculative and might not be effective.

Alternatively, use a scoring system that combines Best Fit with a penalty for bins that are almost full. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity after placing the item is very small (like 1 unit), it's better to leave that space for a small item. But again, without knowing future items, this is a gamble.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by electricity (since we're Tesla). Think of the remaining capacity as a potential energy. The goal is to minimize potential energy. So the priority is the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item. This is the same as Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a logarithmic scale. The priority could be the logarithm of the remaining capacity after placing the item. But this would prioritize smaller remaining spaces, similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a reciprocal with a twist. For example, priority = 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1) if the item fits. This way, bins that leave less space have higher priority. For example, if remaining after is 0, priority is 1/1 = 1. If remaining is 1, priority is 1/2 = 0.5. So the bin with 0 remaining gets higher priority. This is again Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems that many approaches boil down to Best Fit. So perhaps the user wants the Best Fit heuristic implemented. But the problem says to be creative and give priority_v2. So maybe the answer is to implement Best Fit, which is a standard heuristic.

But the user might expect a more creative approach. Let's think again.

Another approach: the priority is the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item size. Wait, that's not useful. Or the product of the item size and the remaining capacity. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a higher priority for even numbers. For example, if the remaining is even, multiply by 2. But this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, use a hybrid approach. For example, if the item is larger than half the bin size, prioritize placing it in an empty bin. Otherwise, use Best Fit. But how to determine that in the priority function.

But the priority function can't have conditional logic based on the item's size relative to the bin size, unless the bin size is known. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity of each bin. The bin's total capacity is fixed, but the function doesn't receive it as an argument. So we can't directly know the bin's total capacity. Unless we assume that the initial capacity is the same for all bins and can be inferred from the maximum value in bins_remain_cap. But that's not reliable, especially as bins are filled.

Hmm. So perhaps the function can't know the total bin capacity, which complicates some heuristics.

Given that, perhaps the Best Fit is the way to go. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    priority = np.where(mask, -new_remain, -np.inf)
    return priority

But let's test this. For example:

item = 3

bins_remain_cap = [5, 4, 3, 2]

mask would be [True, True, True, False]

new_remain = [2, 1, 0, -1]

priority = [-2, -1, 0, -inf]

So the priorities are [-2, -1, 0, -inf]. The highest is 0, so the third bin (which exactly fits the item) is selected. That's correct.

Another example: bins_remain_cap = [4, 3], item=3.

mask is [True, True]

new_remain = 1, 0.

priority = -1, 0. So the second bin is selected (priority 0), which is correct.

So this code correctly implements Best Fit.

But the user wants a creative approach. Maybe the answer is to implement Best Fit, but present it as a creative solution. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different heuristic.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a bonus for bins that are already more utilized. For example, the priority is (bin_capacity - (remaining_cap - item)) which is the total used space after adding the item. But since bin_capacity is not known, this isn't possible. Unless we assume that the initial bin capacity is the same for all bins and can be derived from the initial bins_remain_cap. For example, if the first bin's remaining capacity is the initial capacity. But this is not reliable in an online setting where bins are added dynamically.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the item size and the current used space of the bin. But again, without knowing the bin's total capacity, this isn't possible.

Hmm. Given the constraints, perhaps the Best Fit is the best approach here. So the code for priority_v2 would implement Best Fit.

But the user might expect a different approach. Let's think again.

What about the "Almost Worst Fit" heuristic? This places the item in the bin that leaves the second smallest remaining space. But that's more complex and not better.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that considers the sum of the squares of the remaining capacities. For example, the priority is the negative of the square of (remaining_cap - item). This would more heavily penalize larger remaining spaces, thus preferring tighter fits. But this is similar to Best Fit but with a different weighting.

So the code would be:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item

priority = np.where(mask, -(new_remain ** 2), -np.inf)

This would prioritize bins where (remaining_cap - item) is smallest, same as Best Fit, but with a different scaling. For example, a bin with new_remain 0 has priority 0, new_remain 1 has -1, new_remain 2 has -4. So the bin with new_remain 0 is selected. Same as Best Fit.

So this is just a different way to compute the same priority order. So the result is the same.

Thus, the Best Fit heuristic is the standard approach here. So the code for priority_v2 would implement Best Fit.

But the user wants a creative solution. Maybe the answer is to implement Best Fit but present it as a creative solution. Alternatively, perhaps there's another heuristic.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a higher priority if that remaining capacity is a multiple of the item's size. For example, if the item is 2, and the remaining after placement is 4 (which is a multiple of 2), then this bin is preferred. This could help in packing future items of the same size. But this requires knowing future items, which isn't possible. However, it's a creative approach.

But how to implement this. For example:

For each bin, if the bin can fit the item, compute (remaining_cap - item) and check if it's a multiple of the item. If yes, give higher priority.

But how to translate this into a score. For example:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item

is_multiple = (new_remain % item) == 0

priority = np.where(mask, (is_multiple * 1e6) - new_remain, -np.inf)

This way, bins where the remaining space is a multiple of the item get a high bonus (1e6) and then subtract the new_remain. So within the bins that are multiples, the one with the smallest new_remain is chosen. For non-multiples, the priority is just -new_remain. This prioritizes bins that leave a multiple of the item's size, which might be useful for future items of the same size.

But this is speculative and may not perform better than Best Fit. However, it's a creative approach that Tesla might think of.

But how to handle item size 0? Well, the problem states that item is a float, so assuming it's positive.

But this approach could be implemented. Let's see an example:

item = 2.

Bins_remain_cap = [6, 5, 4, 3].

After placing the item, new_remain = [4,3,2,1].

Check if new_remain is a multiple of 2.

4 is a multiple (yes), 3 no, 2 yes, 1 no.

So for these bins, the priority would be:

For bin 0: 1e6 -4 = 999996.

Bin 1: -3.

Bin 2: 1e6 -2 = 999998.

Bin3: -1.

So the highest priority is bin 2 (999998), then bin0 (999996), then bin3 (-1), then bin1 (-3). So the item is placed in bin2, which leaves 2 (a multiple of 2). This could be useful if future items are of size 2. But in online BPP, this is a gamble.

This is a creative approach. So the code would look like:

def priority_v2(...):
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    is_multiple = np.isclose((new_remain % item), 0)
    # Use a high weight for multiples
    priority = np.where(mask, (is_multiple * 1e6) - new_remain, -np.inf)
    return priority

But we need to handle floating point precision with np.isclose. Also, if item is zero, but the problem states item is a float, probably positive.

This is a creative heuristic that prioritizes leaving space that's a multiple of the item's size. It combines Best Fit with a preference for multiples.

But is this a good approach? It's hard to say without testing, but it's a creative idea that Tesla might propose.

Alternatively, another approach: prioritize bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity that is a prime number. This is more of a stretch, but let's see.

But checking for primes in numpy is computationally intensive and not straightforward. So perhaps not.

Another idea: prioritize bins that have a remaining capacity after placing the item that is a power of two. Again, this is arbitrary but creative.

But implementing this would require checking if (remaining_cap - item) is a power of two. But for floating-point numbers, this is complicated.

Alternatively, the priority could be the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item, plus a bonus if the remaining capacity is a power of two. But again, this is speculative.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the Best Fit approach is the most solid, but the user wants a creative version. So the code for priority_v2 could implement Best Fit, which is a standard heuristic but better than the trivial one.

So the code would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    new_remain = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Best Fit: prioritize smallest remaining space
    priority = np.where(mask, -new_remain, -np.inf)
    return priority

This is the Best Fit heuristic. It's a standard approach but much better than the trivial priority_v1.

But the user might expect a different approach. However, given the information, this is a valid and effective priority function.
