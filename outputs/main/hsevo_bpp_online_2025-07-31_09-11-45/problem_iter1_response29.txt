Okay, I need to create a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin based on the item's size and the remaining capacities of the bins. The highest priority bin will be chosen to place the item. 

Let me think about existing heuristics. The Best Fit algorithm places the item in the bin with the least remaining space that can still accommodate it. But maybe I can improve upon that. 

What if I consider both the remaining capacity after placing the item and how tightly packed the bin would be? For example, a bin that would have very little space left after adding the item might be better because it fills the bin more completely. But also, if the remaining space after placement is a value that's not useful for future items, that's not good. 

Wait, maybe I can calculate a score that combines the remaining space after placing the item and some function that rewards bins that would be filled to a certain level. For instance, if after placing the item, the bin's remaining capacity is small, that's good. But also, if the item fits perfectly, that's the best case. 

Another idea: use a weighted combination of factors. For each bin, if the bin can fit the item, compute a score that is the sum of the remaining capacity after placing the item (so smaller remaining is better, which would invert that value) and maybe the square of the used space. Or perhaps a function that prioritizes bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is a value that's less likely to be wasted. 

Alternatively, think about the "efficiency" of the bin after adding the item. The efficiency could be (item size + (original capacity - remaining capacity)) / original capacity. But original capacity is fixed, so maybe it's just (used space + item size) / bin size. But how does that help in the priority?

Wait, the priority function needs to assign a higher score to bins that are more desirable. So for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, the priority should be -infinity or something. Otherwise, the priority is a function of how good the fit is. 

Let me consider the following approach: For each bin that can fit the item, calculate the remaining space after placing the item (remain_cap - item). Then, the priority could be (1 / (remain_cap - item + 1e-9)) to prioritize bins where the remaining space is smallest. That's similar to Best Fit. But maybe add another term to encourage bins that are already more filled. 

Alternatively, use a combination of the remaining space after placement and the current utilization. For example, the score could be (current_used + item) / bin_size + (bin_size - (current_used + item)) / bin_size. Wait, that's just (current_used + item + bin_size - current_used - item)/bin_size = 1. That doesn't make sense. 

Hmm. Maybe the score should be a function that rewards higher utilization and penalizes leaving small unusable spaces. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining space is small, that's good. But also, if the bin is already nearly full, that's better. 

Another angle: consider the "waste" of the bin. The waste is the remaining capacity after placing the item. The smaller the waste, the better. So the priority could be inversely proportional to the waste. But maybe adjust it with a non-linear function. For example, (1 / (waste + 1e-9)) to make sure that bins with smaller waste get higher priority. 

But maybe also consider the current fill level. For example, a bin that is 80% full and adding the item would make it 90% full is better than a bin that's 10% full and adding the item makes it 20% full, even if the waste is the same. So perhaps the priority should be a combination of the new fill level and the inverse of the waste. 

Wait, let's formalize this. For each bin, if the bin can fit the item, the new remaining capacity is (remain_cap - item). The new fill level is (original capacity - (remain_cap - item)) / original capacity. So the fill level is (original_cap - remain_cap + item) / original_cap. But original_cap is fixed for all bins, so maybe it's (current_used + item) / bin_size. 

But how to get the original capacity? Wait, the input is bins_remain_cap. So the original capacity is not given. Wait, the bins are all of the same fixed size, right? Because in the bin packing problem, all bins have the same capacity. So the original capacity is a fixed value, say, 1.0 (assuming normalized sizes). Wait, but the problem statement says "fixed-sized bins" but the code's input is bins_remain_cap. So perhaps the original capacity is the same for all bins, but the code doesn't have access to it. Hmm, that's a problem. 

Wait, the priority function is given the remaining capacities. So the original capacity is not passed as an argument. So how can we compute the original capacity? For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.3, then the original capacity is 0.3 plus the sum of items already in it. But since the problem is online, the original capacity is fixed for all bins. So perhaps the original capacity is a known constant. But in the code, how do we handle that? 

Wait, the problem statement says "fixed-sized bins", but the code's priority function doesn't have access to the original bin size. So perhaps the code assumes that all bins have a fixed size, say 1.0, and the items are normalized. But in the code provided, the function is given bins_remain_cap, which is the remaining capacity. So the original capacity is (remaining capacity + sum of items in the bin). But since the function doesn't have that information, perhaps the original capacity is a fixed value. 

This is a problem. Because without knowing the original bin size, the priority function can't compute the fill level. For example, if the original bin size is 10, and a bin has a remaining capacity of 3, then the used space is 7. But if the original bin size is 100, then the same remaining capacity of 3 would mean a used space of 97. 

But in the online BPP, the original bin size is fixed. So perhaps the code assumes that the original bin size is 1.0, and all items and remaining capacities are normalized. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.2, then the original capacity is 1.0, and the used space is 0.8. 

Assuming that, then the fill level after adding the item would be (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) = 1.0 - remain_cap + item. 

But how to handle this in the code. Wait, the code's input is bins_remain_cap, which is the remaining capacities. So the original capacity is the same for all bins. Let's call it bin_capacity. But the code doesn't have access to bin_capacity. So perhaps the code is written under the assumption that the original bin capacity is 1.0, and all items and remaining capacities are fractions. 

In that case, the fill level after adding the item would be (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) = 1.0 - remain_cap + item. 

But how to use that in the priority function. 

Alternatively, perhaps the priority function can be designed without knowing the original bin capacity. For example, the priority could be based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. 

But let's proceed. 

So, for each bin, if the bin can fit the item (remain_cap >= item), then the priority is a function of (remain_cap - item). The smaller this value, the better. So the priority could be 1/(remain_cap - item + epsilon) to make higher values for smaller remaining space. 

But that's similar to Best Fit. 

But maybe we can add another term. For example, the current remaining capacity of the bin. Bins that are already more filled might be better to fill further. 

Wait, for example, a bin with remain_cap = 0.5 and item size 0.3. After placing, remain_cap becomes 0.2. Another bin with remain_cap 0.4 and item size 0.3. After placing, remain_cap 0.1. The second bin is better. So the Best Fit approach would choose the second bin. 

But perhaps we can also consider the current utilization. For example, a bin that is 0.8 full (remain_cap 0.2) and adding an item of 0.1 would make it 0.9 full. The remaining space is 0.1, which is better than a bin that was 0.5 full and adding 0.3 (remain_cap 0.2). So the first case is better. 

So the priority function should prefer bins where after placing the item, the remaining capacity is as small as possible. 

But how to combine that with the current state. 

Another idea: the priority could be a combination of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the reciprocal of the remaining capacity. For example, (1 / (remain_cap_after)) + (current_used / bin_capacity). But again, without knowing bin_capacity, this is tricky. 

Wait, if bin_capacity is 1.0, then current_used is (1.0 - remain_cap). So the current_used is (1.0 - bins_remain_cap). 

So, perhaps the priority can be calculated as (1.0 - (bins_remain_cap - item)) + (1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)). 

Wait, (1.0 - (bins_remain_cap - item)) is the new fill level. So that's (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) = 1.0 - remain_cap + item. Which is the same as (current_used + item). 

But how does that help? 

Alternatively, the priority could be the new fill level plus a term that rewards smaller remaining space. 

But perhaps a better approach is to use a weighted sum of the new fill level and the inverse of the remaining space. 

Alternatively, use a heuristic that combines Best Fit with something else. 

Another approach: the "Almost Full" heuristic. If placing the item in a bin would make the bin almost full (e.g., remaining capacity less than a certain threshold), that's good. So the priority could be higher for bins where (remain_cap - item) is below a certain threshold. 

But how to set the threshold. Maybe dynamically based on the item size. 

Alternatively, use a function that gives higher scores to bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is a value that is less than the average item size seen so far. But since this is online, we don't have future information. 

Hmm. Maybe a better approach is to use a combination of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the square of the new fill level. For example, the priority could be (new_fill_level)^2 - (remain_cap_after). 

But how to compute new_fill_level. If bin capacity is 1.0, then new_fill_level is (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) = 1.0 - remain_cap + item. 

So the priority would be (1.0 - remain_cap + item)^2 - (remain_cap - item). 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, the priority could be (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) + (1.0 / (remain_cap - item + 1e-9)). 

This would combine the new fill level (which is maximized) and the inverse of the remaining space (which is also maximized when remaining space is small). 

But this might lead to very large values when the remaining space is very small. 

Alternatively, use a weighted sum. For example, 0.7 * (new_fill_level) + 0.3 * (1.0 / (remain_cap_after + 1e-9)). 

But how to determine the weights. 

Alternatively, think of it as a multi-objective optimization: maximize the fill level and minimize the remaining space. 

But perhaps a better way is to use a heuristic that combines these factors. 

Another idea: the priority is the sum of the new fill level and the reciprocal of the remaining space. 

So for each bin that can fit the item:

priority = (new_fill_level) + (1 / (remain_cap_after + 1e-9))

But this would give higher priority to bins that are filled more and have less remaining space. 

But this could be problematic because the reciprocal term can dominate. For example, a bin with remain_cap_after = 0.1 would have a reciprocal term of 10, while a bin with remain_cap_after = 0.2 would have 5. The new fill level for the first is 0.9, and for the second, 0.8. So the first bin's priority is 0.9 +10=10.9, the second is 0.8+5=5.8. So the first is better. 

But maybe this is desired. 

But perhaps the reciprocal term is too strong. Maybe we can scale it down. For example, multiply by a small factor. 

Alternatively, use the square of the reciprocal. 

Alternatively, use the logarithm. 

Alternatively, use the new fill level multiplied by the reciprocal. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, think of it as a product of the new fill level and the reciprocal of the remaining space. 

priority = (new_fill_level) * (1 / (remain_cap_after + 1e-9))

This would give higher scores to bins that are both filled more and have less remaining space. 

For example, if a bin after placement is 0.9 full (new_fill_level=0.9) and remain_cap_after=0.1, the product is 0.9 * 10 =9. 

Another bin with new_fill_level=0.8 and remain_cap_after=0.2: 0.8 *5=4. 

So the first bin is better. 

But if a bin is 0.95 full (remain_cap_after=0.05), then 0.95 *20=19. 

This seems to prioritize bins that are almost full, which is good. 

But what about a bin that is filled 0.5 and the item is 0.5, making it full. Then new_fill_level=1.0, remain_cap_after=0. So the priority is 1.0 * (1/0.0000001) which is very high. So this would be the best possible case. 

Yes, that's correct. 

So this heuristic would prioritize bins that can be filled completely first, then those that are filled as much as possible. 

This seems like a good approach. 

But how to handle the case where remain_cap_after is zero. Adding 1e-9 avoids division by zero. 

So the code would compute for each bin:

if the bin can fit the item (remain_cap >= item):

new_fill = (1.0 - (remain_cap - item))  # assuming bin capacity is 1.0

remain_after = remain_cap - item

priority = new_fill * (1.0 / (remain_after + 1e-9))

Else:

priority = -infinity (or a very low value)

But wait, the code needs to return a priority score for each bin. So for bins that can't fit the item, their priority should be set to a very low value (like -np.inf) so they are not selected. 

So the code would first compute a mask of feasible bins (bins_remain_cap >= item). Then, for those bins, compute the priority as ( (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) ) * (1.0 / ( (remain_cap - item) + 1e-9 )) )

Wait, but (1.0 - (remain_cap - item)) is the new fill level. 

But if the bin's original capacity is not 1.0, this calculation is incorrect. 

Ah, here's the problem. The code's priority function doesn't know the original bin capacity. So the code as written assumes that the original bin capacity is 1.0, which may not be the case. 

But the problem statement says that the bins are fixed-sized. So the original capacity is the same for all bins. Let's call it 'C'. Then, the remaining capacity is given as bins_remain_cap. 

But the code doesn't have access to C. So how can we compute the new fill level? 

Wait, the new fill level is (C - (remain_cap - item)) / C = (C - remain_cap + item)/C = ( (C - remain_cap) + item ) / C. 

But (C - remain_cap) is the current used space. So the new fill level is (current_used + item)/C. 

But without knowing C, we can't compute this. 

So the code's current approach is flawed unless C is 1.0. 

But the problem statement doesn't specify that. So perhaps the code is intended to work with normalized bins where C=1.0. 

Assuming that, then the code can proceed. 

So, the priority function would be:

For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bin_remain_cap >= item:

    new_fill = 1.0 - (bin_remain_cap - item)  # since C=1.0

    remain_after = bin_remain_cap - item

    priority = new_fill * (1.0 / (remain_after + 1e-9))

else:

    priority = -inf

But how to implement this in numpy. 

In code:

def priority_v2(...):

    # Compute feasible bins

    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # Compute remain_after for all bins (but only feasible ones matter)

    remain_after = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Compute new_fill: 1.0 - remain_after (since C=1.0)

    new_fill = 1.0 - remain_after

    # Compute priority as new_fill / (remain_after + 1e-9)

    priority = new_fill / (remain_after + 1e-9)

    # Set non-feasible bins to -infinity

    priority = np.where(feasible, priority, -np.inf)

    return priority

Wait, but new_fill is (1.0 - remain_after) = 1.0 - (bins_remain_cap - item) = 1.0 - bins_remain_cap + item. 

But if C is 1.0, then bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the current used space is 1.0 - bins_remain_cap. Adding the item gives a new used space of (1.0 - bins_remain_cap) + item. Which is 1.0 - (bins_remain_cap - item). 

So new_fill is the new used space. 

But the priority is new_fill multiplied by the reciprocal of the remaining space. 

So the code would look like this. 

But let's test with an example. 

Example 1: item=0.5, bins_remain_cap = [0.6, 0.4, 0.3]

Feasible bins are all, since 0.6 >=0.5, 0.4 <0.5 (no?), wait 0.4 is less than 0.5. So feasible is only the first bin (0.6 >=0.5). 

Wait, no: 0.6 >=0.5 → feasible. 0.4 <0.5 → not feasible. 0.3 <0.5 → not feasible. 

So for the first bin, remain_after =0.6-0.5=0.1. new_fill=1.0 -0.1=0.9. priority=0.9 /0.1=9.0. 

Other bins have priority -inf. So the first bin is selected. 

Another example: item=0.3. Bins_remain_cap = [0.4, 0.3, 0.5]. 

Feasible bins are all. 

For each bin:

Bin 0: remain_after=0.4-0.3=0.1 → new_fill=0.7 → priority=0.7 /0.1=7. 

Bin 1: remain_after=0.0 → new_fill=1.0 → priority=1.0 / (0.0 +1e-9) = 1e9. 

Bin 2: remain_after=0.5-0.3=0.2 → new_fill=0.8 → priority=0.8/0.2=4. 

So bin 1 has the highest priority (1e9), so it's selected. That's correct because placing the item in bin 1 fills it completely. 

Another example: item=0.2. Bins_remain_cap = [0.3, 0.25, 0.2]. 

All bins are feasible. 

Bin 0: remain_after=0.1 → new_fill=0.9 → priority=0.9/0.1=9. 

Bin 1: remain_after=0.05 → new_fill=0.95 → priority=0.95/0.05=19. 

Bin 2: remain_after=0.0 → new_fill=1.0 → priority=1e9. 

So bin 2 is selected. 

This seems to work well. 

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    feasible = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remain_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    new_fill = 1.0 - remain_after  # Assuming bin capacity is 1.0
    priority = new_fill / (remain_after + 1e-9)
    priority = np.where(feasible, priority, -np.inf)
    return priority

But wait, the code uses 1.0 as the bin capacity. What if the actual bin capacity is different? For example, if the bin capacity is 100, and the remaining capacities are in that scale. Then, the code would not work correctly. 

But the problem statement says that the function is for online BPP, and the bins are fixed-sized. So the code's assumption that the bin capacity is 1.0 is a limitation, but perhaps the problem expects that the items and remaining capacities are normalized. 

Alternatively, perhaps the code should not assume the bin capacity is 1.0. But without knowing the original capacity, it's impossible to compute the fill level. 

So the code as written is based on the assumption that the bin capacity is 1.0. 

But the problem statement doesn't specify this. So perhaps the code is intended to work with normalized data. 

In that case, the code is correct. 

Another possible improvement: instead of using 1.0 as the bin capacity, perhaps the code can use the sum of the remaining capacity and the item's size. Wait, no. The original bin capacity is (current_used + remain_cap). But current_used is not known. 

So without knowing the original capacity, the code can't compute the fill level. 

Therefore, the code's approach is only valid if the original bin capacity is 1.0. 

But given that the problem statement doesn't provide the original capacity, this is a necessary assumption. 

So the code for priority_v2 is as written. 

Another test case: item=0.5, bins_remain_cap = [0.5, 0.6]. 

Feasible bins are both. 

For bin 0: remain_after=0.0 → new_fill=1.0 → priority=1.0 / 0.0000001 → 1e7. 

For bin 1: remain_after=0.1 → new_fill=0.9 → priority=0.9/0.1=9. 

So bin 0 is selected, which is correct. 

Another case: item=0.4, bins_remain_cap = [0.4, 0.5]. 

Bin 0: remain_after=0.0 → priority 1e9. 

Bin 1: remain_after=0.1 → new_fill=0.9 → priority 9. 

So bin 0 is selected. 

This seems to work. 

Thus, the code for priority_v2 is as written.
