Okay, I need to create a priority_v2 function that's better than the existing priority_v1 for the online bin packing problem. Let me first understand what priority_v1 does. 

The current heuristic checks for exact fits first, giving them infinite priority. For valid bins (where the item fits), it calculates a combined score using the geometric mean of tightness and utilization, plus an alignment bonus based on how well the remaining space matches the item size. 

The hints suggest thinking outside the box. The user mentioned possible ideas like residual harmonics, adaptive weighting, or physics-inspired terms. Let me brainstorm some improvements.

First, the exact fit is already handled well. Maybe the alignment bonus in v1 is a bit simplistic. Instead of comparing remaining space to the item, perhaps consider how the remaining space could fit future items. For example, if after placing this item, the bin has space that's a common size, that's better. But since it's online, we don't know future items, so maybe use the current item's size as a proxy for future items.

Another idea: Use a weighted combination that adapts based on the item size. For example, when the item is large, prioritize tight fits more. When it's small, maybe balance tightness and leaving useful remaining space.

Also, the v1 uses a fixed 0.15 weight for the alignment bonus. Maybe make this adaptive. For instance, when the item is a certain fraction of the bin size, adjust the weights.

What about introducing a term that encourages bins where the remaining space after placing the item is a multiple of the item's size? That could help in cases where similar items come in succession.

Alternatively, use a harmonic mean or other combination methods. The geometric mean in v0 is good, but maybe a different combination could better balance the factors.

Another angle: The residual alignment in v1 uses exp(-|remaining_space - item| / item). Maybe instead, use a term that rewards remaining spaces that are multiples of some base, like the item size. For example, if remaining_space is k*item, for some k, that's good because it can fit k items of the same size. But since it's online, we don't know, but perhaps using the item's size as a base makes sense.

Wait, the alignment bonus in v1 is trying to make the remaining space align with the item size. But maybe a better approach is to have the remaining space be a multiple of the item size. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining space is 2*item_size, then that's good because it can fit two more such items. But since we don't know future items, this is speculative. However, if the current item is part of a stream that might have similar items (which is common in some scenarios), this could help.

Alternatively, consider the remaining space's "usefulness" by taking the reciprocal of the remaining space modulo the item size. But that might be too complex.

Another thought: The combined_score in v1 is sqrt(tightness * utilization). Tightness is 1/(remaining_space + eps), utilization is 1/(bin_cap + eps). Wait, bin_cap is fixed for all bins, right? Because each bin has the same capacity. Wait, bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity of each bin. So utilization here is 1/(bins_remain_cap + eps), which would be higher for bins that are more full. Tightness is how close the remaining space is to zero after placing the item. So the combined_score is higher when the bin is more utilized and the fit is tight.

But maybe the utilization term isn't necessary because bins_remain_cap varies. Wait, utilization here is 1/(remaining capacity of the bin before placing the item). So for a bin that's already nearly full, adding this item would make it even fuller, which is good. But the tightness is about how much space is left after adding the item. So the combined_score is trying to balance how full the bin is before adding the item and how tight the fit is after.

Hmm. Maybe the utilization term is redundant because tightness already considers the remaining space after adding the item. Or perhaps they are complementary.

In any case, the v1 combines these two with a geometric mean. Let's think of other ways to combine them. Maybe add a term that considers the bin's current utilization before placing the item. For example, a bin that is already half-full might be preferable to a bin that's empty, depending on the item size.

Wait, the current utilization in v1 is 1/(bins_remain_cap + eps), which is higher when the bin is more full (since bins_remain_cap is the remaining space). So for a bin that's almost full (small remaining space), utilization is high. So the combined_score would be higher for bins that are already more full and where the item fits tightly.

But maybe we can introduce a term that encourages placing the item in a bin that, after placement, leaves a remaining space that is a "useful" size. For example, if the remaining space is a common item size, or if it's a multiple of the current item's size. But without knowing future items, this is speculative. However, using the current item's size as a proxy for future items could be a heuristic.

So, here's an idea: For each bin, after placing the item, calculate how many more such items could fit. For example, remaining_space_after = bin_remain_cap - item. Then, if remaining_space_after >= item, then you could fit floor(remaining_space_after / item) more items. The more such items fit, the better, perhaps. So a bonus based on that.

But this might be too optimistic. Alternatively, the bonus could be based on the remaining_space_after divided by the item size. For example, if remaining_space_after is 0.5*item, then it's 0.5, which is not useful. But if it's 2*item, then 2. So a higher value is better. But this would encourage leaving space for more items of the same size, which might not come. However, in an online setting where items are similar, this could help.

Alternatively, use a term like 1/(remaining_space_after % item + eps), which would be higher when remaining_space_after is a multiple of the item size. But modulo with floating points can be tricky.

Another angle: The alignment_bonus in v1 is 0.15 * exp(-|remaining_space - item|/(item + eps)). This gives a bonus when remaining_space (after placing the item) is close to the item size. But maybe instead, we want the remaining space to be a multiple of the item size. For example, remaining_space_after = bin_remain_cap - item. If remaining_space_after is equal to k*item, for some integer k >=0, then that's good. But how to compute that?

Alternatively, compute how close remaining_space_after is to a multiple of the item size. For example, the minimal distance to the nearest multiple. But that might be complex.

Alternatively, use the fractional part: remaining_space_after / item. If this is close to an integer, then it's good. But again, with floating points, this is tricky.

Alternatively, think of the remaining_space_after as a potential to fit another item of size 's', where 's' is the current item's size. So the bonus could be max(0, remaining_space_after - s) if remaining_space_after >= s, but that's not quite right.

Wait, perhaps the alignment bonus in v1 is trying to leave space that matches the item size, which could be useful if another similar item comes. But maybe a better approach is to leave space that is a multiple of the current item's size. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining space is 2*item_size, then two more such items could fit. So the bonus could be higher when remaining_space_after is a multiple of item_size.

But how to compute that? One way is to compute the absolute difference between remaining_space_after and the nearest multiple of item_size, then apply a Gaussian or exponential decay based on that difference.

For example:

nearest_multiple = item * np.round(remaining_space_after / item)
diff = np.abs(remaining_space_after - nearest_multiple)
alignment_bonus = np.exp(-diff / (item + 1e-9))

This would give a higher bonus when remaining_space_after is close to a multiple of the item size. But this might be computationally intensive. Alternatively, use the remainder when dividing remaining_space_after by item. The smaller the remainder, the better.

Another idea: Introduce a dynamic weighting between tightness and the alignment bonus based on the item size. For example, if the item is large, prioritize tightness more. If it's small, give more weight to the alignment bonus.

Also, the current combined_score uses sqrt(tightness * utilization), which is the geometric mean. Maybe use a weighted geometric mean, where the weights depend on the item size.

Additionally, the epsilon (1e-9) is fixed. Maybe adjust it based on the item size to avoid numerical issues when the item is very small or large.

Putting this all together, here's a plan for priority_v2:

1. Keep the exact fit handling as in v1.

2. For valid bins, compute tightness and utilization as before, but perhaps adjust their combination based on the item size.

3. Replace the alignment_bonus with a term that rewards remaining_space_after (bin's remaining capacity after placing the item) being a multiple of the item size. For example, compute how close remaining_space_after is to the nearest multiple of item_size, and apply an exponential decay based on that.

4. Introduce adaptive weights for combining the scores. For example, when the item is large, weight tightness more; when small, weight utilization or alignment more.

5. Use dynamic epsilon values based on the item size to handle numerical stability.

Let me try to draft this.

First, compute remaining_space_after = bins_remain_cap - item.

Exact fit is when remaining_space_after is close to zero.

For the alignment bonus, compute how close remaining_space_after is to a multiple of item. For example:

k = np.round(remaining_space_after / item)
desired_space = k * item
diff = np.abs(remaining_space_after - desired_space)
alignment_bonus = np.exp(-diff / (item * 0.1))  # The 0.1 is a scaling factor

This would give a higher bonus when remaining_space_after is close to a multiple of the item size.

Then, the combined_score could be a weighted geometric mean of tightness and utilization, with weights depending on the item size. For example, if the item is large (close to bin size), weight tightness more. If small, weight utilization more.

But how to compute the weights? Maybe:

item_ratio = item / bin_capacity  # Assuming bin_capacity is known. Wait, the function doesn't have bin_capacity as a parameter. Hmm. The bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity of each bin. The original bin capacity can be inferred as bins_remain_cap[0] + (original capacity - bins_remain_cap[0]), but that's not possible because the original capacity isn't known. Wait, the problem states that bins are fixed-size, but the function doesn't receive the bin size as a parameter. So this approach might not be feasible unless we can infer it.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible bin capacity is the maximum possible item size. But that's not necessarily true. This is a problem. Without knowing the bin capacity, we can't compute item_ratio. So this approach might not work.

Alternative idea: Use the item size itself. For example, if the item is large (e.g., > 0.5 * average bin capacity), but again, without knowing the bin capacity, this is tricky.

Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. The original bin capacity is fixed, say C. So for a bin that is empty, bins_remain_cap[i] = C. For a partially filled bin, it's C - sum of items in it. But the function doesn't have access to C. So we can't compute the original bin capacity. Therefore, any heuristic that depends on the original bin capacity can't be implemented unless we infer it. But that's not possible if all bins are empty except some. For example, if all bins are empty, bins_remain_cap is an array of C. But if some bins are partially filled, we can't know C unless we track it. Since the function is given bins_remain_cap, but not C, this complicates things.

Therefore, any terms that require knowing the original bin capacity are not feasible. So the previous idea of using item_ratio is not possible. So we need to adjust without that.

Alternative approach: Use the item size relative to the remaining space before placing the item. For example, if the item is a large fraction of the remaining space, then prioritize tightness.

Wait, the remaining space before placing the item is bins_remain_cap. So item_size / bins_remain_cap would be the fraction of the remaining space that the item occupies. If this is close to 1, then the item is a tight fit. So for such cases, we might want to prioritize tightness.

So, for each bin, compute fill_ratio = item / bins_remain_cap. Then, use this ratio to weight between tightness and utilization.

But how? Maybe the weight for tightness is fill_ratio, and the weight for utilization is 1 - fill_ratio. Then, the combined_score becomes (tightness^fill_ratio) * (utilization^(1 - fill_ratio)).

This way, when the item fills most of the bin's remaining space (fill_ratio close to 1), tightness is emphasized. When the item is small (fill_ratio close to 0), utilization is emphasized.

This is a form of dynamic weighting based on how much the item fills the bin's remaining capacity.

So, implementing this:

fill_ratio = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)
# To avoid division by zero, but bins_remain_cap is >= item for valid bins.

weight_tightness = np.clip(fill_ratio, 0, 1)
weight_util = 1 - weight_tightness

combined_score = (tightness ** weight_tightness) * (utilization ** weight_util)

This would dynamically adjust the weights based on how much the item fills the bin.

Then, the alignment bonus could be based on how close the remaining_space_after is to a multiple of the item size, as discussed earlier.

Putting it all together:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    remaining_space_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_space_after, 0, atol=1e-9)
    valid = remaining_space_after >= 0
    
    # Dynamic epsilon based on item size
    eps = max(1e-9, item * 1e-9)
    
    # Tightness: inverse of remaining space after placement
    tightness = 1 / (np.abs(remaining_space_after) + eps)
    
    # Utilization: inverse of remaining space before placement
    utilization = 1 / (bins_remain_cap + eps)
    
    # Adaptive weights based on how much item fills the bin's remaining capacity
    fill_ratio = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps)
    fill_ratio = np.clip(fill_ratio, 0, 1)  # Ensure ratio doesn't exceed 1
    weight_tightness = fill_ratio
    weight_util = 1 - fill_ratio
    
    # Weighted geometric mean
    combined_score = (tightness ** weight_tightness) * (utilization ** weight_util)
    
    # Multiples alignment: bonus for remaining space being multiples of item size
    k = np.round(remaining_space_after / (item + eps))
    ideal_remaining = k * item
    alignment_diff = np.abs(remaining_space_after - ideal_remaining)
    alignment_bonus = 0.2 * np.exp(-alignment_diff / (item + eps))
    
    # Future capacity bonus: encourage leaving space >= current item size
    future_space = remaining_space_after
    future_bonus = 0.1 * np.where(future_space >= item, 1/(future_space + eps), 0)
    
    priorities = np.where(
        exact_fit,
        np.inf,
        np.where(
            valid,
            combined_score + alignment_bonus + future_bonus,
            -np.inf
        )
    )
    
    return priorities

Wait, let's break this down:

1. remaining_space_after is computed as before.

2. exact_fit and valid are handled similarly.

3. eps is now dynamic, based on the item size. This helps with numerical stability when the item is very small or large.

4. tightness and utilization are computed as before.

5. fill_ratio is the item size divided by the bin's remaining capacity before placing the item. This gives how much of the bin's remaining space the item would take. Clipped to 0-1 to avoid issues when item > bins_remain_cap (but valid is already handling that).

6. The combined_score uses a weighted geometric mean, where the weights depend on fill_ratio. When the item fills most of the bin (fill_ratio high), tightness is weighted more. When the item is small (fill_ratio low), utilization is weighted more.

7. The alignment_bonus is now based on how close remaining_space_after is to a multiple of the item size. The 'k' is the nearest integer multiple, and the difference is the distance from that multiple. The exponential term gives a higher bonus when the difference is small.

8. Added a future_bonus term that rewards remaining_space_after being at least the item size. This is because if the remaining space is >= item, it can fit another item of the same size. The bonus is 0.1 * 1/(future_space + eps) when future_space >= item, else 0. This way, larger remaining spaces that can fit more items get a higher bonus, but inversely scaled by the space (so tighter fits are better).

The future_bonus term encourages leaving space that can fit at least one more item of the same size. This is speculative but could help in cases where similar items follow.

The weights 0.2 and 0.1 for alignment and future bonuses are arbitrary, but they can be adjusted. However, since the problem is online, these hyperparameters might need tuning based on expected item distributions.

Testing this function against v1 would be needed to see if it performs better, but the logic incorporates dynamic weighting, multiple bonuses for different desirable outcomes, and numerical stability.

Potential issues: 

- The future_bonus term could conflict with tightness. For example, a bin that after placement has a lot of space (which is bad for tightness) but can fit more items (good for future_bonus). However, the combined_score (tightness and utilization) and the future_bonus are added, so it's a balance.

- The alignment_bonus might not contribute much if the remaining_space_after is not close to a multiple of the item. But in cases where it is, it gives an extra boost.

Overall, this approach tries to balance immediate tight packing with potential future packing opportunities, using adaptive weights and multiple heuristic terms.
