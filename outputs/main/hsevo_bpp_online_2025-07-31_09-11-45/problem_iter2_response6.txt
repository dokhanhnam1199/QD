Okay, I need to create a priority_v2 function that combines elements from the better code (priority_v0) and the worse code (priority_v1), while incorporating the analysis and experience provided. Let me start by understanding the key points from the analysis.

The better code (v0) uses hyperbolic scoring for tight fits, includes a density bonus with square root, and gives a special reward for perfect fits. It also uses relativistic weights and handles near-fits with inverse square law penalization. The worse code (v1) combines tightness and utilization using harmonic mean but might over-penalize mid-range bins.

The analysis mentions that effective heuristics balance tight packing with flexibility, use smooth gradients, and handle floating-point precision. The best heuristics combine harmonic efficiency with residual potential. The worse ones use multiplicative terms that can be problematic.

So, to combine elements from both, I should take the hyperbolic fit score from v0 and the utilization concept from v1 but find a better way to combine them. The analysis also suggests using geometric mean for balanced tradeoffs. The v0 uses density_bonus (sqrt of bin capacity), which relates to existing utilization. The v1's utilization is 1 - (bin capacity), assuming bin size is 1.

Wait, in v1, the utilization is calculated as 1 - (bins_remain_cap / 1.0), which makes sense if the bin's total capacity is 1. So, if a bin has remaining capacity 0.3, it's 70% utilized. But in v0, the density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which might not directly relate to utilization. Hmm, maybe that's part of the problem. The better approach is to consider both how full the bin is and how tight the fit would be.

The analysis also mentions that combining factors with geometric mean (like in the best heuristics) is better than harmonic or multiplicative. So perhaps instead of harmonic mean (as in v1) or the combination in v0, use a geometric mean of tightness and utilization.

Wait, in the analysis, it says that the best heuristic combines harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt capacity) via geometric mean. So maybe the geometric mean of fit_score (1/remaining) and density_bonus (sqrt(bins_remain_cap))?

Wait, in v0, the fit_score is 1/(remaining_space + 1e-9), and density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Then they combine them as fit_score * (1 + density_bonus) divided by (1 + sqrt(remaining_space)). Hmm, but the analysis says that the best uses geometric mean. So perhaps the product of fit_score and density_bonus, then take the square root (geometric mean).

Alternatively, maybe the geometric mean of tightness and utilization. Let me think.

In v1, tightness is 1/(remaining_after) and utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap (since bin size is 1). Then they use harmonic mean. But the analysis says that multiplicative terms can over-penalize. So maybe using geometric mean would be better.

So, combining the hyperbolic fit (from v0) and utilization (from v1) using geometric mean. Also, include the perfect fit reward as in v0.

Another point from the analysis is handling floating-point precision with np.isclose, which v0 does. Also, smooth gradients are important, so avoid sharp penalties.

So, here's a plan:

1. Calculate remaining_space after placing the item. Valid_mask as before.
2. For valid bins, compute tightness (1/(remaining_space + eps)) and utilization (1 - bins_remain_cap, assuming bin capacity is 1). Wait, bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So utilization would be (original capacity - remaining) / original capacity. If the original bin capacity is 1, then utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap. So in v1, utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap, which makes sense.
3. Combine tightness and utilization using geometric mean (sqrt(tightness * utilization)) instead of harmonic mean. This would balance both factors.
4. Add a density bonus as in v0, but maybe adjust it. Wait, in v0, density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which is the remaining capacity. But utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap. So maybe the density bonus should be based on how full the bin is. For example, sqrt(1 - bins_remain_cap) to favor bins that are already more full.
5. Apply the perfect fit reward using np.isclose.

Wait, but in v0, the density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which is the remaining capacity. That seems counterintuitive because a higher remaining capacity means the bin is less utilized. But the comment says it's to favor higher existing density. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. If bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity, then a lower value means the bin is more full. So sqrt(bins_remain_cap) would be higher for bins with more remaining space. That might not align with favoring more utilized bins. Maybe the density_bonus should be based on the used space, not the remaining. So if the bin's remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap, then the used space is 1 - bins_remain_cap (assuming bin size 1). So density_bonus could be sqrt(1 - bins_remain_cap), which increases as the bin is more full.

But in v0, the density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which might be a mistake. Or perhaps the analysis mentions that the better code combines harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt capacity). Wait, residual potential could refer to the remaining capacity. So maybe the sqrt(bins_remain_cap) is intended to give a bonus to bins that have more remaining space, allowing for future flexibility. But that seems conflicting with the idea of favoring fuller bins. Hmm.

Wait, the analysis says that the best heuristic combines harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt capacity) via geometric mean. So residual potential here is sqrt of the bin's remaining capacity. So even though a bin with more remaining space is less full, the sqrt term gives a bonus for potential to fit future items. So the heuristic balances tight fit (1/remaining) with flexibility (sqrt remaining). That's an interesting approach. So in v0, the density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which is the remaining capacity. So combining tightness (which prefers less remaining) with residual potential (which prefers more remaining) via product, but normalized.

But in the v0 code, the scores are fit_score * (1 + density_bonus) divided by (1 + sqrt(remaining_space)). So fit_score is 1/(remaining_space), density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Then multiplied by (1 + density_bonus) and divided by (1 + sqrt(remaining_space)). Hmm, not sure. But according to the analysis, the best combines via geometric mean.

So perhaps the correct approach is to take the geometric mean of the tightness (1/remaining) and the residual potential (sqrt(remaining)), which would be (1/remaining * sqrt(remaining))^0.5 = (sqrt(remaining)/remaining)^0.5 = (1/sqrt(remaining))^0.5 = 1/remaining^0.25. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, the analysis says the best uses "harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt capacity) via geometric mean". So harmonic efficiency is 1/remaining, residual potential is sqrt(capacity), where capacity is the bin's total capacity. Wait, but in the problem, all bins have the same capacity, which is fixed. So maybe residual potential refers to the remaining capacity. So the residual potential is sqrt(remaining_capacity). Then the geometric mean would be sqrt( (1/remaining) * sqrt(remaining) ) = sqrt( sqrt(remaining) / remaining ) = (remaining^(-1/2))^0.5 = remaining^(-1/4). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the residual potential is the existing used capacity. So if a bin is more full, it has higher residual potential. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to combine the tightness (1/remaining) and the utilization (how full the bin is) in a balanced way. For example, tightness encourages putting the item in a bin where it fits exactly, while utilization encourages using bins that are already more full to fill them up.

So, for each valid bin, the score could be a combination of tightness and utilization. The v1 uses harmonic mean, which the analysis says is worse. The better approach is geometric mean.

So, tightness = 1/(remaining_after + eps)
utilization = 1 - bins_remain_cap (since bins_remain_cap is remaining, and bin size is 1)
combined_score = sqrt(tightness * utilization)

But wait, utilization here is how full the bin was before adding the item. Because bins_remain_cap is the current remaining capacity. So after adding the item, the remaining would be bins_remain_cap - item. But utilization is based on the current state before adding.

So combining tightness (how well the item fits) and utilization (how full the bin is) via geometric mean.

Additionally, for perfect fits, we give a bonus as in v0.

Also, handle near-fits with a smooth penalty, perhaps using inverse square as in v0.

Wait, in v0, they have fit_score * (1 + density_bonus) / (1 + abs(remaining_space)**0.5). The denominator adds a penalty based on remaining space. So maybe the denominator is a way to penalize bins with more remaining space after placement, but in a smoother way.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined score should be tightness * utilization, but with each term adjusted.

Putting this all together:

1. Calculate remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
2. valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
3. For valid bins:
   a. tightness = 1/(remaining_after + eps)
   b. utilization = 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) / bin_capacity. Wait, no. Wait, utilization before adding the item is 1 - bins_remain_cap (if bin capacity is 1). After adding, the utilization would be 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item). But we want the utilization before adding, because that's the current state. So utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap.

But in the combined score, we want to reward bins that are already more full (higher utilization) and have a tighter fit (higher tightness). So combining these two factors.

The analysis mentions that the best heuristics use geometric mean. So combined_score = sqrt(tightness * utilization). But tightness is 1/remaining_after, which is very large for small remaining_after. Utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap, which is higher for bins that are more full.

Wait, but utilization here is the current utilization of the bin before adding the item. So a bin that is already more full (higher utilization) would get a higher score, encouraging to fill it up more. Tightness is how well the item fits into the bin (small remaining_after is better).

So combining these two with geometric mean would balance both factors. For example, a bin that is very full (high utilization) but the item leaves a lot of space (low tightness) would have a moderate score. A bin that is not very full (low utilization) but the item fits tightly (high tightness) would also have a moderate score. The highest scores would be when both are high.

Additionally, for perfect fits (remaining_after ≈0), we boost the score as in v0.

Also, to handle floating-point precision, use np.isclose with a tolerance.

Another point from the analysis is that multiplicative terms can over-penalize, so maybe using a sum or another combination. But geometric mean is a product under a root, which is less harsh than pure product.

Putting this into code:

def priority_v2(...):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
    eps = 1e-9
    tightness = 1 / (remaining_after + eps)
    utilization = 1 - bins_remain_cap  # assuming bin capacity is 1
    # since after placing the item, the remaining is bins_remain_cap - item
    # but utilization here is before placing, which is 1 - bins_remain_cap
    combined = np.sqrt(tightness * utilization)
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, combined, -np.inf)
    # check for perfect fit
    perfect_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=eps)
    scores = np.where(perfect_fit, scores.max() + 1, scores)
    return scores

Wait, but utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap, which is the current utilization. However, when we place the item, the bin's utilization becomes (1 - bins_remain_cap) + item. But in the heuristic, we are considering the current state (before placing) and the fit after placing.

But maybe the utilization factor here is to prefer bins that are already more utilized, encouraging to fill them up. So even if placing the item in a nearly full bin leaves little remaining space, the fact that the bin was already full is good.

But in this case, the utilization is the current utilization, not after placement. So combining tightness (post-placement) and utilization (pre-placement).

Alternatively, maybe the utilization after placement is better. But that would be 1 - (bins_remain_cap - item) = 1 - bins_remain_cap + item. But item is the size of the current item. However, since the item varies, this might not be consistent. So perhaps using pre-placement utilization is better as a heuristic.

But I'm not sure. Let me think. The analysis says that the better code (v0) uses a density bonus which is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which is the remaining capacity. So in v0, higher remaining capacity gives a higher density bonus, which seems counterintuitive. But according to the analysis, this is part of the residual potential. So maybe the idea is that bins with more remaining space have more potential for future items, so we should balance between tight fit and residual potential.

Wait, perhaps the residual potential is the remaining capacity after placing the item. So in v0, the residual potential is remaining_space (after placing), and the density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap) (the remaining capacity before placing). Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the residual potential is the remaining capacity after placing the item. So in that case, the residual potential is remaining_after. Then, the heuristic in v0 combines tightness (1/remaining_after) with residual potential (sqrt(remaining_after)) via some combination.

But in v0's code, the density_bonus is sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which is the remaining capacity before placing the item. So that's the current remaining capacity, not after placing.

Hmm. Maybe the key is to balance between the tightness of the fit (1/remaining_after) and the bin's current utilization (1 - bins_remain_cap). So a bin that is already more utilized (higher 1 - bins_remain_cap) gets a higher utilization score, and a tighter fit (higher 1/remaining_after) gets a higher tightness score. Combining these via geometric mean would balance both.

So the combined score would be sqrt( (1/(remaining_after + eps)) * (1 - bins_remain_cap) )

But wait, 1 - bins_remain_cap is the current utilization. So this encourages placing the item in a bin that is already more full and where the item fits tightly.

But what if a bin is almost full (high utilization) but the item doesn't fit tightly? Or a bin is not full (low utilization) but the item fits exactly. The geometric mean would require both factors to be high for a high score.

This could be a good balance. Let's test with an example.

Example 1: Bin A has remaining capacity 0.1 (utilization 0.9). Item size is 0.09. remaining_after = 0.01. tightness = 1/0.01 = 100. utilization = 0.9. combined = sqrt(100 * 0.9) = sqrt(90) ≈9.49.

Example 2: Bin B has remaining capacity 0.5 (utilization 0.5). Item size 0.5. remaining_after=0. tightness=1/0.01 (wait, no, remaining_after is 0, so tightness is 1/(0 + 1e-9) = 1e9. utilization is 0.5. combined = sqrt(1e9 * 0.5) ≈ 22360. But since it's a perfect fit, we add a bonus. So in this case, the perfect fit would get a higher score.

But in this case, the tightness is very high, and utilization is 0.5. The combined score is sqrt(1e9 *0.5) ≈ 22360, which is higher than the first example. But the first example's bin is more utilized but the fit is not as tight. However, the second example's bin is less utilized but the fit is perfect. The combined score favors the perfect fit even if the bin is less utilized.

But after adding the item, Bin B would be full, which is good. So this seems acceptable.

Another example: Bin C has remaining capacity 0.2 (utilization 0.8). Item size 0.19. remaining_after=0.01. tightness=100. utilization=0.8. combined= sqrt(100 *0.8)= ~8.94. So lower than example 2 but higher than example 1.

But example 1's utilization is 0.9, tightness 100. So combined sqrt(100*0.9)= ~9.49. So higher than example C. So a bin that is more utilized and a tight fit gets a higher score than a less utilized but same tightness.

This seems reasonable.

Now, the perfect fit case: remaining_after is 0. So tightness is 1e9, utilization is 1 - (original remaining capacity). For example, if original remaining was 0.5, then utilization is 0.5. So combined score is sqrt(1e9 *0.5) ≈22360. Then, we apply the perfect fit bonus by setting the score to max_score +1. So if the max score in other bins is, say, 9.49, then the perfect fit gets 9.49 +1 =10.49. Wait, but in the code I wrote earlier, the perfect fit's score is set to scores.max() +1. But in this case, the perfect fit's original score is already 22360, which is much higher than others. So adding 1 may not be necessary. But in v0, the perfect fit is set to 2 * scores.max() +1. So perhaps in v0, even if the perfect fit's calculated score is high, they still boost it further.

But according to the analysis, the better code (v0) gives a special reward for perfect fits. So in the code, after calculating the scores, any bin with a perfect fit gets a score of 2 * max_score +1. This ensures that perfect fits are always chosen over others, even if their calculated score is already high.

So in the example where a perfect fit has a very high score, this boost may not be necessary, but it's a way to prioritize perfect fits above all else.

So incorporating that into the code:

In the combined score, after calculating, check for perfect fits and set their score to 2 * max_score +1.

But wait, in the code I sketched earlier, after calculating the combined score, we set the perfect fit's score to scores.max() +1. But if the perfect fit's original score is already the max, then adding 1 just makes it slightly higher. But in v0, they set it to 2 * max_score +1, which is a bigger boost.

So perhaps in v2, we should follow v0's approach for perfect fits.

Putting it all together:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Combines tight fit prioritization (1/remaining) with existing bin utilization
    using geometric mean. Boosts perfect fits to ensure selection.
    """
    eps = 1e-9
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    # Calculate components
    tightness = 1 / (remaining_after + eps)
    utilization = 1 - bins_remain_cap  # Prefer bins that are already fuller
    
    # Geometric mean balances tight fit and utilization
    combined = np.sqrt(tightness * utilization)
    
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, combined, -np.inf)
    
    # Apply perfect fit boost
    perfect_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=eps)
    if np.any(perfect_fit):
        # Boost perfect fits above all others
        scores = np.where(perfect_fit, scores.max() * 2 + 1, scores)
    
    return scores

Wait, but in the code above, utilization is 1 - bins_remain_cap, which is the current utilization of the bin before placing the item. The tightness is based on the remaining space after placing the item. So this combines the current utilization with the future tightness.

But is this the right approach? For example, a bin that is currently 90% full (remaining 0.1) and the item is 0.09, leaving 0.01. The utilization is 0.9, tightness is 100. Combined score sqrt(0.9 * 100) = ~9.49.

Another bin that is 50% full (remaining 0.5) and the item is 0.5, leaving 0. The utilization is 0.5, tightness is 1e9. Combined score sqrt(0.5 * 1e9) ≈ 22360. Then, the perfect fit boost would set it to 22360 *2 +1, which is even higher. So this bin would be selected.

But what if there's another bin that is 10% full (remaining 0.9) and the item is 0.9, leaving 0. Utilization is 0.1, tightness is 1e9. Combined score sqrt(0.1 * 1e9) ≈ 10,000. Then the perfect fit boost makes it 20,000 +1. So it's selected.

This seems to work well, as perfect fits are prioritized.

But what about a bin that is 50% full and the item fits with 0.4 remaining. Utilization is 0.5, tightness is 1/(0.4) = 2.5. Combined score sqrt(0.5 *2.5) ≈ sqrt(1.25) ≈1.118. Lower than other cases.

So this heuristic seems to balance both factors.

But according to the analysis, the better code (v0) also includes a density bonus and uses a relativistic weighting. However, the user wants to combine elements from both v0 and v1. The v1 uses utilization and tightness with harmonic mean, which is worse. The better approach is to use geometric mean.

Another element from v0 is the inverse square law for near-fit penalization. But in the current code, that's not included. Maybe adding a penalty term for remaining_after.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined score could be (tightness * utilization) / (1 + remaining_after), which would penalize larger remaining_after. But this is getting more complex.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the best heuristics use smooth gradients. The current code uses sqrt(tightness * utilization), which is smooth.

Another point from the analysis is that the better code handles floating-point precision with np.isclose, which is included here.

So the current code for v2 combines tightness and utilization via geometric mean, applies perfect fit boost, and uses valid_mask. This seems to align with the analysis.

Testing edge cases:

- Item exactly fits in a bin (remaining_after=0): boosted to highest priority.
- Item fits in multiple bins: the one with best combination of tightness and utilization is chosen.
- Bins with high utilization but not tight fit vs. bins with lower utilization but tight fit: balanced by geometric mean.

This should be better than v1's harmonic mean and avoid over-penalizing as in multiplicative terms.

Thus, the final code for priority_v2 combines tightness and utilization via geometric mean, applies perfect fit boost, and uses valid_mask to filter invalid bins.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Balances tight fit (1/remaining_space) with bin utilization (1 - bin_cap_remain)

    smooth gradient for near-optimal placements."""
    
    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_space >= 0
    eps = 1e-9  # Prevent division by zero
    
    # Core components
    tightness = 1 / (remaining_space + eps)  # Hyperbolic fit priority
    utilization = 1 - bins_remain_cap  # Existing bin fullness (assuming bin size=1)
    
    # Geometric mean balances immediate fit vs existing utilization
    combined = np.sqrt(tightness * utilization)
    
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, combined, -np.inf)
    
    # Exponential boost for perfect fits using tolerance-aware check

    scores = np.where(perfect_fits, scores * 2 + 1e6, scores)  # Maintain relative ordering
    
    return scores
```
