Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online Bin Packing Problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin for a given item, so that the bin with the highest score gets the item. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here.

First, the existing priority_v1 just returns zeros, which isn't helpful. So I need to come up with a smarter strategy. Let's recall common bin packing heuristics. The Best Fit algorithm places an item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space. That's effective because it tries to fill bins as much as possible. But maybe there's a way to enhance this.

Wait, the priority function needs to return a score for each bin. So for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, the priority should be very low (like negative infinity). Otherwise, we calculate a score based on some criteria.

Hmm, Best Fit would prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is minimized. So the priority could be the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item. But maybe we can add some other factors to make it more efficient.

Another idea: consider how "full" the bin would be after adding the item. Bins that are almost full are good because they reduce fragmentation. So maybe the priority is the new remaining capacity, but inverted. For example, if after adding the item, the bin has 0.2 left, that's better than 0.5. So the priority could be (1 - new_remaining) which is the used space. But that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe we can combine multiple factors. For example, the priority could be a combination of how well the item fits and how much space is left. Or maybe use exponential terms to prioritize bins that are almost full.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by electricity and resonance, since I'm supposed to be Nikola Tesla. Maybe the priority is based on how well the item "resonates" with the bin's remaining capacity. Like, the closer the item size is to the remaining capacity, the higher the priority. That's exactly Best Fit. But perhaps we can add a twist.

Another angle: consider the efficiency of the bin after adding the item. The efficiency is (sum of items in bin) / bin size. So if adding the item increases the efficiency, that's good. But how to translate that into a priority score.

Alternatively, think about the inverse of the remaining space. For example, if after adding the item, the remaining space is r, then 1/(r + epsilon) could be a priority. This way, smaller r gives higher priority, which is Best Fit. But maybe using a different function.

Wait, maybe we can use a non-linear function to prioritize bins that are almost full. For example, using an exponential function to heavily penalize larger remaining spaces. So the priority could be something like (1 - new_remaining) ** 3. That way, bins that are closer to being full get much higher scores.

Another factor: the "wasted space" if the item is placed here. If the bin's remaining capacity after adding the item is r, then r is the wasted space. We want to minimize that. So the priority could be -r. But that's the same as Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe we can also consider the current remaining capacity of the bin. For example, if a bin has a lot of space left, maybe it's better to leave it for larger items. But in online BPP, we don't know future items. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, but in online scenarios, we have to make decisions based on current information. So the priority should be based on how well the current item fits into the bin, and how that affects the overall packing.

Another thought: the priority could be a combination of the fit (remaining after placement) and the current utilization. For example, a bin that is already half full might be a better candidate if the item fits well. But how to combine these.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum. For example, priority = (current remaining capacity - item size) * weight1 + (current remaining capacity) * weight2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think of the priority function as follows: for each bin, if the item fits, calculate a score that encourages placing the item in a bin that results in the least remaining space, but also maybe prefers bins that are already more full. Because a bin that's 80% full and can take a 15% item (leaving 5%) is better than a bin that's 10% full and takes the same item (leaving 85%).

So the priority could be (current remaining capacity - item size) which is the new remaining capacity. But we want to maximize this value. Wait, no, because if the new remaining is smaller, that's better. So the priority should be the negative of the new remaining capacity. So for each bin, the priority is -(remaining_cap - item) if the item fits, else -infinity. That's exactly the Best Fit approach.

But maybe we can add a term that also considers the current remaining capacity. For example, if the bin's current remaining capacity is very small, even if the item doesn't fit, but that's not possible. Wait, no. The item can only be placed in bins where remaining_cap >= item.

Wait, perhaps the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) + (remaining_cap) * 0.1. Wait, but that would mean that even if the remaining after is the same, a bin with higher initial remaining cap would have higher priority. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the priority is (remaining_cap - item) + (1 - (remaining_cap - item)/bin_size). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, use a non-linear function. For example, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) + (remaining_cap)^2. But this might not be effective.

Wait, perhaps the key is to use a function that heavily penalizes larger remaining space. For example, using the reciprocal of the new remaining space. So priority = 1 / (new_remaining + epsilon). This way, bins with smaller new_remaining get higher priority. But this is similar to Best Fit, just scaled differently.

Alternatively, use an exponential function. For example, priority = exp(-new_remaining). This way, as new_remaining decreases, the priority increases exponentially. That could work.

But how to handle bins where the item doesn't fit. Those bins should have a priority of -infinity, so they are not selected.

Putting this together, the steps for the priority function would be:

1. Calculate the new remaining capacity for each bin if the item is added. new_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item.

2. For bins where new_remaining >=0, compute the priority as some function of new_remaining. For others, set priority to -infinity.

So for the priority function, let's try using the exponential of the negative new_remaining. So priority = np.exp(-new_remaining). This way, smaller new_remaining (better fit) gives higher priority.

But wait, when new_remaining is 0, exp(0) is 1. If new_remaining is 0.1, exp(-0.1) is ~0.9. So the priority decreases as new_remaining increases. That's correct. So the highest priority is when new_remaining is 0.

But maybe we can also multiply by the current utilization. For example, the current utilization is (bin_size - bins_remain_cap) / bin_size. If the bin is already more full, maybe that's better. But how to incorporate that.

Alternatively, the priority could be (1 - new_remaining) * (current utilization). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: the priority could be the sum of the item size and the current used space in the bin. For example, if a bin has 0.5 remaining, and the item is 0.3, then the used space after adding is 0.5 (original used) + 0.3 = 0.8. The priority could be 0.8. But this is similar to the First Fit Decreasing approach, which prioritizes putting items into bins that are already more full. But in this case, the priority is the new used space. So bins that would be more full after adding the item get higher priority. That's a good approach. This is called the "Best Fit" strategy, where you choose the bin that leaves the smallest possible gap. But in this case, the priority is the new used space, which is equivalent to (bin_size - new_remaining). So the priority would be (bin_size - (bins_remain_cap - item)) = (bin_size - bins_remain_cap + item) = (used_space + item). Wait, but the bin's original used space is (bin_size - bins_remain_cap). Adding the item gives a new used space of (bin_size - bins_remain_cap) + item. But the bin's remaining capacity after adding is (bins_remain_cap - item). So the new used space is bin_size - (bins_remain_cap - item) = (bin_size - bins_remain_cap) + item. So the priority could be this value. But since bin_size is fixed, this is equivalent to (current_used + item). But since all bins have the same bin_size, this is a valid approach. However, this would prioritize bins that have more used space, which is similar to Best Fit. Because if two bins can fit the item, the one that ends up with more used space (i.e., less remaining) is better.

Wait, but in this case, the priority is (current_used + item) = (bin_size - bins_remain_cap + item) = bin_size - (bins_remain_cap - item) = bin_size - new_remaining. So the priority is higher when new_remaining is smaller. So this is equivalent to using (bin_size - new_remaining) as the priority. Since bin_size is a constant for all bins, this is the same as using -new_remaining as the priority. Which is the same as Best Fit. So this approach would be equivalent to Best Fit.

But the user wants a priority function. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is a good starting point. But maybe we can enhance it.

Another idea: combine Best Fit with a look-ahead for potential future items. But since it's online, we can't do that. So perhaps we can use a heuristic that not only considers the remaining space but also the "efficiency" of the bin.

Alternatively, use a weighted combination of the remaining space and the square of the remaining space. For example, priority = - (new_remaining + 0.1 * new_remaining^2). This would penalize larger remaining spaces more heavily.

Alternatively, use a reciprocal function. For example, priority = 1 / (new_remaining + 1e-9). This way, bins with smaller new_remaining get much higher priority. But this could lead to very large numbers when new_remaining is near zero, but that's okay.

Wait, but in code, how to handle this. Let's outline the steps:

For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

- Check if the bin can fit the item (bins_remain_cap[i] >= item)
- If yes, compute new_remaining = bins_remain_cap[i] - item
- The priority for this bin is some function of new_remaining
- If no, priority is -infinity

So the code would first compute a mask of feasible bins (where bins_remain_cap >= item). Then compute the priority for those bins, and set others to -infinity.

So for the priority function, let's try using the reciprocal of new_remaining. But to avoid division by zero, add a small epsilon.

But wait, when new_remaining is zero, the reciprocal is infinity. But in practice, we can use 1/(new_remaining + epsilon). So the priority would be higher for smaller new_remaining.

Alternatively, use the negative of new_remaining. That's the Best Fit approach.

But perhaps combining multiple factors. For example, the priority could be (1 / (new_remaining + epsilon)) + (current_used / bin_size). This way, bins that are already more full get a higher priority, even if the new_remaining is the same. But since current_used is (bin_size - bins_remain_cap), and bin_size is fixed, this is equivalent to adding (bin_size - bins_remain_cap)/bin_size. But this might not be necessary.

Alternatively, use a combination of the reciprocal and the square. For example, priority = 1/(new_remaining + 0.1) + 1/(new_remaining^2 + 0.1). This would give higher priority to bins with very small new_remaining.

But perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let's think of a simple yet effective heuristic.

Another approach: the "Almost Full" heuristic. If a bin can fit the item and after adding, the remaining capacity is very small (e.g., less than a certain threshold), prioritize that bin. Otherwise, use Best Fit. But how to implement that in a priority function.

Alternatively, the priority could be a step function where bins that can fit the item and have remaining capacity after adding the item less than a certain value (like 0.1) get a very high priority, and others are prioritized by Best Fit.

But this requires setting thresholds, which may not be optimal for all item distributions.

Alternatively, use a sigmoid function to give a boost to bins that are close to being full. For example, priority = (1 / (1 + np.exp(-k*(1 - new_remaining)))) where k is a scaling factor. This would give higher scores to bins where new_remaining is small.

But this might complicate the code.

Alternatively, use a power function. For example, priority = (1 - new_remaining) ** 3. This way, bins that are almost full get a much higher priority. For example, if new_remaining is 0.1, (0.9)^3 = 0.729. If new_remaining is 0.2, 0.8^3=0.512. So the priority decreases as new_remaining increases.

But how does this compare to Best Fit? Let's see. Suppose two bins: after adding the item, one has 0.1 remaining, another 0.2. Using the power function, the first has higher priority. Which is correct. So this is similar to Best Fit but with a non-linear scaling.

So the code would compute new_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item. For feasible bins, compute priority as (1 - new_remaining) ** 3. For others, -infinity.

But wait, 1 - new_remaining is (1 - (bins_remain_cap - item)) = (1 - bins_remain_cap + item). But bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity before adding the item. So 1 - bins_remain_cap is the current used space. So 1 - new_remaining = current_used + item. Which is the same as the new used space. So (new_used_space) ** 3. So the priority is the cube of the new used space. This would prioritize bins that are more full, which is a good strategy.

But in this case, the priority is higher for bins that are more full. For example, a bin that after adding the item is 90% full (new_used=0.9) would have a priority of 0.9^3=0.729, while a bin that is 80% full would have 0.8^3=0.512. So this gives a higher weight to more full bins.

This could be a better heuristic than Best Fit because it more aggressively favors filling bins to higher capacities.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    # Compute new_remaining for all bins
    new_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Check which bins can fit the item
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # Initialize priorities to -infinity
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    # For feasible bins, compute priority as (1 - new_remaining) ** 3
    feasible_new_remaining = new_remaining[mask]
    priorities[mask] = (1 - feasible_new_remaining) ** 3
    return priorities

Wait, but 1 - new_remaining is the new used space. So for each feasible bin, the priority is (new_used_space) cubed. This would indeed prioritize bins that are more full.

Alternatively, maybe use the square instead of cube. But the cube would give a stronger preference.

Another idea: use the negative of new_remaining. So priorities[mask] = -new_remaining. Which is Best Fit. But the cube approach is different.

So the code for priority_v2 would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    new_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    priorities[mask] = (1 - new_remaining[mask]) ** 3  # Cube of new used space
    return priorities

But wait, 1 - new_remaining is the new_used_space. For example, if a bin had 0.5 remaining, and the item is 0.3, new_remaining is 0.2. 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, which is the new_used_space. So the priority is 0.8^3 = 0.512.

Another bin with new_remaining 0.1 would have priority 0.9^3=0.729. So this bin is preferred.

Yes, this seems like a good approach. It's a variation of Best Fit but with a non-linear scaling that heavily favors bins that are closer to being full.

Alternatively, maybe use the reciprocal of new_remaining. Let's see:

priorities[mask] = 1 / (new_remaining[mask] + 1e-9)

In this case, a bin with new_remaining 0.1 would have priority 10, while a bin with 0.2 would have 5. So the first is preferred. This is similar to Best Fit but with a different scaling.

But which approach is better? The cube approach might be more aggressive in favoring nearly full bins, which could lead to better packing in some cases.

Alternatively, combine both factors. For example, priorities could be (1 - new_remaining) ** 3 + 1/(new_remaining + 1e-9). But this might not be necessary.

But given the problem statement, the user wants a creative approach. So using the cube of the new_used_space (1 - new_remaining) is a creative twist on Best Fit.

Another idea inspired by electricity: think of the bins as capacitors. The item is a charge that needs to be placed in a capacitor. The priority could be based on how much the capacitor's voltage (remaining capacity) matches the charge (item size). But this is a bit abstract.

Alternatively, use a logarithmic function. For example, priorities[mask] = -np.log(new_remaining[mask] + 1e-9). This way, smaller new_remaining gives higher priority (since log approaches -infinity as new_remaining approaches zero). But this would invert the priorities. Wait, no: if new_remaining is 0.1, log(0.1) is -2.3, so the priority would be 2.3. If new_remaining is 0.2, log(0.2) is -1.6, priority 1.6. So higher priority for smaller new_remaining. But this is similar to the reciprocal approach.

But perhaps using the cube is more novel.

So the final code for priority_v2 is as follows. It uses the cube of the new_used_space (1 - new_remaining) as the priority for feasible bins. This should encourage packing items into bins that will be more full, potentially reducing the number of bins used.
