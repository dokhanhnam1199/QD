Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about what strategies are effective here.

First, the goal is to minimize the number of bins used. So, we want to pack items efficiently. A common heuristic is the Best Fit algorithm, which places an item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space. But maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, Isaac Newton's perspective... Maybe considering physical principles. Like, gravity or forces. Hmm. How can that apply here?

Alternatively, think of the bins as containers. When adding an item, we want to maximize the density of the bin. Or perhaps prioritize bins where adding the item would make the remaining capacity as small as possible, but not negative. That's similar to Best Fit.

But maybe we can add a penalty for bins that are too full. Or use a function that rewards bins that can fit the item and have the least space left, but also considers other factors.

Another idea: use a non-linear scoring. For example, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but inverted. So, if a bin has exactly enough space, that's the highest priority. But if there's more space, maybe the priority decreases. But how to model that?

Wait, Newton might think in terms of optimization. Maybe the priority should be a function that combines the fit of the item and the current state of the bin. For example, a bin that can fit the item and has a remaining capacity close to zero is ideal. But also, bins that are already partially filled might be better to fill up first.

So, for each bin, calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item. If the item doesn't fit (remaining capacity <0), the priority is -infinity or a very low value. Otherwise, the priority could be (remaining_capacity_after) or (1 / (remaining_capacity_after + epsilon)) to favor bins that leave less space.

But maybe we can make it more nuanced. For example, the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining space after placing the item. That way, bins that have the least space left get higher priority. But we need to handle cases where the item can't fit.

Wait, the standard Best Fit uses the maximum of (remaining capacity - item size) that is non-negative. So the priority would be (bins_remain_cap - item), and we pick the bin with the smallest non-negative value. But in terms of priority scores, we can assign higher scores to bins where (bins_remain_cap - item) is smallest and non-negative.

So, for each bin, if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item, then the priority is (1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + 1e-9)), which would be higher for smaller remaining space. If the bin can't fit the item, assign a very low priority like -infinity.

But how to implement this in numpy?

Alternatively, use the remaining capacity after placing the item. For bins that can fit, the priority is (1 / (remaining_cap_after + 1e-9)), which would be higher for smaller remaining. Bins that can't fit get a priority of -infinity.

Wait, let's code that. For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item: then priority[i] = 1 / (bins_remain_cap[i] - item + 1e-9)

else: priority[i] = -np.inf

This would make the best fit (smallest remaining space) have the highest priority. But maybe we can add another term to consider the current utilization of the bin. For example, the existing filled space. So, a bin that is already half full might be better to fill up more.

Alternatively, the priority could be a combination of the remaining space after adding the item and the current filled space. For example, (filled_space + item) / bin_capacity, which is the utilization. But how to combine these.

Wait, another approach: the score could be the sum of the filled space after adding the item, but only if it fits. So, filled = (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap) + item. The utilization is filled / bin_capacity. Higher utilization is better. So the priority would be filled if the item fits, else -infinity. But that's similar to Best Fit Decreasing.

Alternatively, the priority could be (filled) if it fits, which would prefer bins that are filled the most. But that's the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. Let's think of a different angle. Maybe use a heuristic inspired by physics. For example, the "potential" of a bin. The potential could be higher when the bin is more filled, and when adding the item brings it closer to full. So, the potential function could be something like (current filled + item) / capacity. But again, similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a quadratic term. For example, the priority is (current filled + item)^2. This would prioritize bins where the sum is higher, which might lead to better packing. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: when you add the item to a bin, the remaining space is (bins_remain_cap[i] - item). We want this to be as small as possible but non-negative. So, the priority for each bin is (1 / (remaining_space_after + 1e-9)) if it fits, else -infinity. This would assign higher priority to bins where the remaining space is smallest. That's exactly the Best Fit approach.

So, implementing that in code:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = remaining_after >= 0
    priority = np.where(valid, 1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return priority

But maybe we can add a term that also considers the current remaining capacity. For example, bins that are already more full (i.e., smaller remaining capacity) might be better to fill up. So, the priority could be a combination of the current remaining capacity and the remaining after adding the item.

Wait, but if a bin has a remaining capacity of 5, and the item is 3, then after adding, remaining is 2. Another bin with remaining 4 and item 3 would have remaining 1. The second bin is better. So the Best Fit approach works here.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a weighted sum of the current remaining and the remaining after. But I'm not sure. The standard Best Fit is known to perform reasonably well, so perhaps the priority_v2 can be an implementation of Best Fit.

But the user wants a creative approach. Let's think of another heuristic. For example, the priority could be the product of the current filled space and the filled space after adding the item. Or some other function.

Alternatively, use a penalty for bins that are almost full. Wait, no. The goal is to fill them up. So maybe the priority is higher for bins that can fit the item and have the least remaining space.

Another idea: use the square of the filled space after adding the item. So, (filled)^2. This would prioritize bins that are more full, as the square term would give higher weight to higher utilization.

For example, filled_after = (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]) + item. Then priority is filled_after^2 if it fits, else -infinity. This is similar to the "Maximal Rectangles" heuristic in some packing problems.

But how does that compare to Best Fit? Let's see. Suppose bin A has 4 units filled (remaining 6), and the item is 5. After adding, filled is 9 (assuming bin capacity is 10). So filled_after^2 is 81. Bin B has 5 units filled (remaining 5), item is 5. After adding, filled is 10, squared is 100. So bin B would be chosen. That's correct. But if the item is 3, bin A has remaining 6, after adding 3, remaining 3. filled_after is 7, squared 49. Bin B has remaining 5, after adding 3, remaining 2. filled_after is 8, squared 64. So bin B is chosen. That's better. So this heuristic would prefer bins that, after adding the item, have higher filled space. Which is similar to Best Fit but with a squared term.

But how to code this. The bin's current remaining capacity is bins_remain_cap[i]. The filled after adding is ( (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]) + item ). But bin_capacity is not given. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the filled after adding is ( (original capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]) + item ). But original capacity is not known. Wait, the problem states that the bins are fixed-sized. So each bin has the same capacity. Let's call it bin_capacity. But the function doesn't receive bin_capacity as an argument. Hmm. So how can we compute the filled space after adding the item?

Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the filled space before adding the item is (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]). After adding the item, the filled space is (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i] + item). But the remaining capacity after adding is (bins_remain_cap[i] - item). So the filled after is bin_capacity - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) = (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]) + item. But bin_capacity is not known. Wait, but the bins_remain_cap is the current remaining capacity. So the filled after adding is (original filled) + item. But original filled is (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]). So filled_after = (bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i] + item). But bin_capacity is a fixed value. However, the function doesn't have access to bin_capacity. So this approach is not possible unless we can infer it.

Wait, the problem says that the bins are fixed-sized. So each bin's total capacity is the same. But the function only receives the remaining capacities. So the original capacity is not known. Therefore, we can't compute the filled space after adding the item unless we can infer the original capacity. For example, if the bins_remain_cap is [5,3,2], then the original capacity must be at least 5 (assuming all bins are initially empty). But that's not possible. Wait, no. The bins are initially empty. So the original capacity is the maximum possible remaining capacity. Wait, no. When a bin is empty, its remaining capacity is equal to the original capacity. So the original capacity is the maximum possible value in bins_remain_cap. But when bins are being filled, the remaining capacity decreases. So, for example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 5, then the original capacity is 5 if it's empty, but if it's been used, then the original capacity is higher. Wait, no. The original capacity is fixed. For example, all bins have capacity 10. So when a bin is empty, its remaining capacity is 10. When you add an item of size 3, the remaining capacity becomes 7. So the original capacity is the same for all bins, but the function doesn't have access to it. Therefore, the filled_after can't be computed unless we know the original capacity.

This is a problem. So the previous idea of using filled_after squared is not feasible because we don't know the original capacity. Therefore, we can't compute filled_after. So that approach is not possible.

Hmm. So back to the original approach. The Best Fit approach can be implemented with the code I thought earlier. But perhaps we can add a twist. For example, prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is a perfect square, or some other mathematical property. But that's probably not useful.

Alternatively, use a combination of the remaining capacity after adding the item and the current remaining capacity. For example, the priority could be (current remaining capacity) - (remaining after adding). But that's (item) for bins that can fit. So all bins that can fit the item would have the same priority. That's not helpful.

Another idea: the priority is the sum of the reciprocal of the remaining after adding and the reciprocal of the current remaining capacity. So 1/(remaining_after) + 1/(current_remaining). But this would prioritize bins that are already more full and can fit the item. For example, a bin with current remaining 5 and item 3: remaining_after is 2. So 1/2 + 1/5 = 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.7. Another bin with current remaining 4 and item 3: remaining_after 1. 1/1 + 1/4 = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25. So the second bin has higher priority. That's better. But this approach might favor bins that are already more filled. But how does this compare to Best Fit?

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of the reciprocals. 1/(remaining_after) * 1/(current_remaining). For the first example: (1/2)*(1/5) = 0.1. Second example: (1/1)*(1/4) = 0.25. So the second bin is better. But this might not be better than the simple reciprocal of remaining_after.

Alternatively, the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining_after multiplied by the current filled space. But again, without knowing the original capacity, we can't compute the filled space.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the best we can do given the information available. But the user wants a creative v2. So maybe we can add a tie-breaker. For example, when two bins have the same remaining_after, prefer the one with the smaller current remaining capacity. But how to encode that.

Wait, the remaining_after is the same, so the priority is the same. To break ties, we can add a small term based on the current remaining capacity. For example, priority = 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9) + (current_remaining * 1e-10). This way, if two bins have the same remaining_after, the one with smaller current_remaining (i.e., more filled) gets a slightly higher priority. But this is a very minor adjustment.

Alternatively, the priority could be 1/(remaining_after) + (current_remaining_cap / (original_capacity)). But again, original_capacity is unknown.

Alternatively, use the remaining_after and the current_remaining in a different way. For example, the priority is (current_remaining - remaining_after) / (current_remaining + 1e-9). This is the ratio of the item size to the current remaining capacity. But for bins that can fit the item, current_remaining >= item. So (current_remaining - remaining_after) is item. So the ratio is item / current_remaining. This would be higher for bins where the item is a larger fraction of the current remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has remaining 5 and item 3, the ratio is 3/5=0.6. Another bin with remaining 4 and item 3: ratio 3/4=0.75. So the second bin has higher priority. This is different from Best Fit. This heuristic prefers to place the item into a bin where the item takes up a larger proportion of the remaining space. So it's a kind of "proportional fit" heuristic.

But how does this compare to Best Fit? Let's see. Suppose two bins: bin A has remaining 5, bin B has remaining 4. Item is 3. Best Fit would choose bin B (remaining_after 1). The proportional ratio would be 3/5=0.6 vs 3/4=0.75. So bin B is chosen. Same as Best Fit. Another example: bin A has remaining 6, item 3. Bin B has remaining 3.5, item 3. Best Fit would choose bin B (remaining_after 0.5). The proportional ratio for A is 3/6=0.5, for B 3/3.5≈0.857. So B is chosen. Same as Best Fit. Another case: bin A has remaining 4, item 3. Bin B has remaining 5, item 3. Best Fit picks A (remaining_after 1 vs 2). The proportional ratio for A is 3/4=0.75, for B 3/5=0.6. So A is chosen. Same as Best Fit. So in these cases, the proportional ratio gives the same result as Best Fit. But maybe in other cases, it's different.

Wait, let's take a case where Best Fit and this ratio differ. Suppose bin A has remaining 3, item 2. Bin B has remaining 4, item 2. Best Fit would choose A (remaining_after 1) over B (remaining_after 2). The ratio for A is 2/3≈0.666, for B 2/4=0.5. So A is chosen. Same as Best Fit. Another example: bin A has remaining 5, item 3. Bin B has remaining 4, item 3. Best Fit picks B (remaining_after 1). Ratio for A is 3/5=0.6, B is 3/4=0.75. So B is chosen. Same as Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems that the proportional ratio approach gives the same results as Best Fit in these cases. So maybe this approach is equivalent to Best Fit. But how?

Wait, the priority for Best Fit is 1/(remaining_after). The priority for the ratio approach is (item / current_remaining). But remaining_after = current_remaining - item. So item = current_remaining - remaining_after. So the ratio is (current_remaining - remaining_after)/current_remaining = 1 - (remaining_after / current_remaining). So higher ratio means lower remaining_after. So maximizing the ratio is equivalent to minimizing remaining_after. So the ratio approach is equivalent to Best Fit. Therefore, this approach is the same as Best Fit.

So perhaps the initial approach of using 1/(remaining_after) is the same as Best Fit. So the code I wrote earlier for priority_v2 is implementing Best Fit.

But the user wants a creative version. Maybe we can combine Best Fit with another heuristic. For example, if two bins have the same remaining_after, prefer the one that has been used longer (but the function doesn't track that). Or, in the absence of that information, perhaps prefer bins that are closer to being half-full, to balance the distribution.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum of remaining_after and the current remaining capacity. For example, priority = -remaining_after - 0.1 * current_remaining. This would prioritize smaller remaining_after and smaller current_remaining. But this might not be better.

Alternatively, use a non-linear function. For example, priority = (current_remaining - item) if it fits, else -infinity. But that's the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. Maybe the priority function can be designed to prefer bins where the item fills the bin exactly. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity is exactly equal to the item size, that bin gets the highest priority. Otherwise, use Best Fit. This is known as the "Exact Fit" heuristic. So the priority would be highest for bins where remaining_after is zero, then for others, use Best Fit.

So the code can be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    exact_fit = (remaining_after == 0)
    # For exact fit, assign highest priority. Then for others, use 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9)
    priority = np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, np.where(remaining_after >=0, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf))
    return priority

This way, any bin that can exactly fit the item (remaining_after=0) is chosen first. If none, then Best Fit is used. This is a combination of Exact Fit and Best Fit.

This could be more efficient in some cases. For example, if there's a bin that exactly fits the item, it's better to use it, as it perfectly fills the bin, leaving no space. This reduces fragmentation.

So this would be a creative improvement over the standard Best Fit.

Another idea: use a harmonic mean of the current remaining and the remaining_after. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use a penalty for bins that are almost full but not exactly. For example, if remaining_after is very small but not zero, maybe it's better to leave that for future items. But that's more of a look-ahead approach, which isn't possible in online BPP.

Alternatively, use a scoring function that encourages packing items into bins that are already more filled. For example, the priority is (current_remaining - item) if it fits, but multiplied by the current filled space. But again, without knowing the original capacity, we can't compute the filled space.

Wait, the current filled space is (original_capacity - bins_remain_cap[i]). But original_capacity is unknown. So this approach isn't feasible.

Hmm. So given the constraints, the best approach is to implement a combination of Exact Fit and Best Fit. So the priority_v2 function first checks for bins where the item exactly fits (remaining_after=0), assigns them the highest priority (infinity), and for others, uses the Best Fit heuristic.

This would be a valid and creative approach. So the code would look like:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    exact_fit_mask = (remaining_after == 0)
    # For exact fit, priority is infinity. Else, if fits, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), else -inf
    priority = np.where(exact_fit_mask, np.inf, 
                        np.where(remaining_after >= 0, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf))
    return priority

This way, exact fits are prioritized first, then Best Fit is used for others. This can lead to better packing in cases where an item exactly fills a bin, reducing the need for future items to fit into small gaps.

Another possible heuristic is the "Worst Fit", which is the opposite of Best Fit. It places the item into the bin with the largest remaining capacity after insertion. But that's generally worse than Best Fit. So probably not useful here.

Alternatively, a modified Best Fit that also considers the square of the remaining_after. For example, priority is 1/(remaining_after^2 + 1e-9). This would more heavily penalize larger remaining_after values, making the selection more aggressive towards smaller remaining_after.

But I think the combination of Exact Fit and Best Fit is a good creative approach. So the code for priority_v2 would be as above.
