Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used, so we want to pack items efficiently.

First, the existing priority_v1 just returns zeros, which isn't helpful. For v2, I should consider common bin-packing heuristics. The First Fit algorithm places an item in the first bin that has enough space. But since we're assigning priorities, maybe we can do better.

Wait, the Best Fit heuristic places the item in the bin that leaves the least remaining space after placement. That could be a good starting point. So for each bin, calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item. If the item fits, the priority could be the negative of the remaining space (so higher priority for smaller remaining space). But bins that can't fit the item should have a very low priority, maybe negative infinity.

But how to handle that in numpy? Let's see. We can compute the remaining capacity after placing the item: bins_remain_cap - item. Then, for each bin, if the result is >=0, the priority is (remaining_cap_after) but inverted, so that smaller remaining space is better. But maybe we can add other factors.

Alternatively, another approach is to prioritize bins that are almost full but can still fit the item. For example, if a bin has space exactly equal to the item, that's perfect. So maybe the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a higher value for smaller remainders. So for bins that can fit the item, the priority is (1 / (remaining_cap_after + 1e-9)) to avoid division by zero. Bins that can't fit get a priority of -infinity.

Wait, but in numpy, we can compute the remaining capacity after placing the item. Then, for each bin, if the bin can fit the item (i.e., bins_remain_cap >= item), then the priority is (bins_remain_cap - item) but inverted. So higher priority for bins where (bins_remain_cap - item) is smallest. So maybe the priority is 1/(bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9) for valid bins, and -inf otherwise. That way, the bin with the tightest fit gets the highest priority.

But maybe there's a better way. Another heuristic is to look at how full the bin would be after adding the item. For example, the priority could be the sum of the current used space plus the item, divided by the bin's total capacity. But since bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity, the used space is (total_cap - bins_remain_cap). Adding the item would make it (total_cap - bins_remain_cap + item). So the utilization would be (total_cap - bins_remain_cap + item)/total_cap. But we don't know the total capacity of each bin. Wait, the problem states that the bins are fixed-size, but the function doesn't receive the total capacity. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity, but the total capacity isn't given. So maybe we can't use that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the bins all have the same total capacity, say 1.0. But the problem statement doesn't specify. So maybe the priority function can't assume that. So we have to work with the remaining capacity.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is as small as possible, but also considering the current remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.3, and the item is 0.3, then after placing, the bin is full. That's ideal. So the priority for that bin would be higher than a bin that has 0.4 remaining and the item is 0.3, leaving 0.1.

So the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) for bins that can fit, but we want to maximize the negative of that (since smaller remaining is better). So maybe the priority is -(bins_remain_cap - item) for valid bins, and -inf otherwise. That way, the bin with the smallest (bins_remain_cap - item) (i.e., tightest fit) gets the highest priority.

But in code, how to handle that. Let's see:

valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
priority = np.where(valid, -remaining_after, -np.inf)

This would assign higher priority (since -remaining_after is larger when remaining_after is smaller) to bins that can fit the item, with the tightest fit first. That's the Best Fit approach.

But maybe we can combine this with other factors. For example, also considering how full the bin is. For instance, a bin that is already 80% full and can take the item might be better than a bin that is 10% full and can take the item, even if the remaining space is the same. Because filling up a bin that's already mostly full helps in closing that bin sooner.

Wait, but if two bins can fit the item and after placing, one has 0.1 remaining and the other has 0.1 remaining, but one was previously more filled, then they are the same. But perhaps the priority should also take into account the current utilization. For example, a bin that is already 90% full and can take a 0.05 item (leaving 0.05) is better than a bin that is 50% full and can take a 0.45 item (leaving 0.05). Because the first bin is now full, which is better.

But how to model that. The problem is that the priority function only has the remaining capacity of each bin. So the current used space is (total_cap - remaining_cap). But without knowing the total capacity, we can't compute the current utilization. So perhaps the priority function can't take that into account. Therefore, the Best Fit approach (minimizing remaining space after placement) is the best we can do with the given parameters.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the remaining capacity after placement, but also add a term that encourages using bins that are already more filled. For example, the priority could be (current remaining capacity) + (remaining after placement). Wait, but that's not helpful. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the priority could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item size. But that's not directly useful. Alternatively, the priority could be the current remaining capacity minus the item size. But that's the same as the remaining after placement. So that's the same as Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a combination of Best Fit and First Fit. For example, if two bins have the same remaining after placement, we prefer the one that was created earlier (i.e., has a lower index). But how to model that in the priority function. Since the bins_remain_cap array is given, perhaps the order of the bins in the array represents the order in which they were created. So for bins with the same priority, the one with a lower index would be chosen. But the priority function can't track the order. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is sufficient.

So the priority function for v2 would be:

For each bin, if the bin can fit the item (remaining_cap >= item), then the priority is -(remaining_cap - item) (so higher priority for smaller remaining after placement). Bins that can't fit get -infinity. So the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    return np.where(valid, -remaining_after, -np.inf)

But wait, in numpy, the where function returns elements from the second argument where the condition is True, else the third. So in this case, for valid bins, the priority is -remaining_after, else -inf. That would make the bins that can fit the item have higher priority (since -remaining_after is higher when remaining_after is smaller). The bin with the smallest remaining_after (tightest fit) would have the highest priority. That's exactly the Best Fit heuristic.

But maybe we can add a tie-breaker. For example, if two bins have the same remaining_after, perhaps we prefer the one with a higher current remaining capacity. Wait, no. Because if two bins can fit the item and after placement have the same remaining_after, but one has a higher current remaining capacity, that means the item is smaller. Wait, no. Let's see: bin1 has remaining_cap = 0.5, item is 0.3. remaining_after is 0.2. bin2 has remaining_cap = 0.4, item is 0.2. remaining_after is 0.2. So both have same remaining_after. But bin1's current remaining is higher. But after placing, both have same. So in this case, perhaps it's better to choose the bin that was already more filled. Because bin2's current remaining is 0.4, which after placing 0.2 becomes 0.2. But bin1's current remaining is 0.5, placing 0.3 gives 0.2. So after placement, they are the same. But the current utilization before placing is higher for bin2 (since 0.4 remaining implies 0.6 used, assuming total capacity is 1.0). So perhaps in this case, we should prefer the bin that was already more filled. But how to model that without knowing the total capacity.

Wait, the problem is that the total capacity isn't given. So the priority function can't know the total capacity, only the remaining. So if two bins have the same remaining_after, but different current remaining capacities, how to break the tie. For example, bin1 has remaining_cap 0.5, item 0.3 → remaining_after 0.2. bin2 has remaining_cap 0.4, item 0.2 → remaining_after 0.2. Both can fit. Which one is better? If the total capacity is 1.0, then bin1 was 0.5 used, bin2 was 0.6 used. After placing, both are 0.8 used. So in this case, it doesn't matter. But if the total capacity is different, say bin1 is 0.5 remaining (total 0.5?), but that's impossible. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So the total capacity of each bin is fixed, but the function doesn't know it. So perhaps the bins are all of the same total capacity. For example, all bins have a total capacity of 1.0. Then, the current used space is 1.0 - bins_remain_cap. But the function doesn't have that information. So the priority function can't use that.

Therefore, the Best Fit approach is the best possible with the given parameters. So the code would be as described.

But maybe there's another approach. For example, the Worst Fit heuristic, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining space. But that's the opposite of Best Fit. But Worst Fit is known to perform worse in many cases. So Best Fit is better.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a penalty for bins that are almost full. Wait, no. The goal is to fill bins as much as possible.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the item fills the bin exactly. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity is exactly equal to the item size, that's the best possible. So in that case, the priority should be highest. Then, for other bins, the priority is based on how close they are to that.

So the priority could be:

if bins_remain_cap == item → highest priority (e.g., 1.0)
else if bins_remain_cap > item → priority is (1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)) → higher for smaller gaps
else → -inf

But in code, how to handle that. For example:

exact_fit = (bins_remain_cap == item)
valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
priority = np.where(exact_fit, 1.0, np.where(valid, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf))

This way, exact fits get the highest priority, followed by other valid bins with priority inversely proportional to the remaining space after placement. This would prioritize exact fits first, then the tightest fits. But in practice, exact fits are rare. But when they exist, they should be chosen.

But in floating point numbers, exact equality is rare. So perhaps we can check if the remaining_after is very close to zero. But that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe we can just use the inverse of the remaining_after, which would naturally give a very high priority to bins where remaining_after is near zero.

But using 1/(remaining_after) would make the priority very high for small remaining_after. So in code:

valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
priority = np.where(valid, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)

This would assign higher priority to bins with smaller remaining_after. The +1e-9 is to avoid division by zero. This approach is similar to Best Fit but uses the inverse to prioritize tighter fits more aggressively.

Comparing the two approaches:

- Best Fit: priority is -(remaining_after)
- Inverse Fit: priority is 1/(remaining_after + eps)

Which is better? Let's see. For example, if two bins have remaining_after of 0.1 and 0.2, the inverse approach would give 10 and 5, so the first bin is prioritized. The Best Fit approach would give -0.1 and -0.2, so the first bin (higher priority). Both approaches would select the same bin. But for very small differences, the inverse approach would have a larger spread. However, in practice, both approaches are similar. But the inverse approach might have numerical issues if remaining_after is very small. But with the epsilon, it's manageable.

Another consideration: combining multiple heuristics. For example, a hybrid of Best Fit and another heuristic. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity after placing the item is small, and the bin's current remaining capacity is large, that's good. Wait, but how to combine these factors.

Alternatively, the priority could be a weighted sum of the remaining_after and the current remaining capacity. For example:

priority = (remaining_after * -1) + (current_remaining_cap * 0.1)

But this is arbitrary. Without knowing the total capacity, it's hard to balance these terms. So perhaps this isn't a good approach.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the current remaining capacity and the item. Wait, that's the same as the remaining capacity after placing the item. So that's not helpful.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the most straightforward and effective here. But let's think of other possibilities.

Another heuristic is the Almost Full heuristic. For example, prioritize bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity below a certain threshold. But how to set the threshold without knowing the total capacity.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a bonus for bins that are closer to being full. For example, priority = (1 - (remaining_after / total_cap)), but again, without knowing total_cap, this isn't possible.

So given the constraints, the Best Fit approach seems best. But perhaps the inverse approach (using 1/remaining_after) is better because it gives a higher weight to tighter fits. Let's code that.

So the code would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Use inverse of remaining_after to prioritize tighter fits
    # Add a small epsilon to avoid division by zero
    scores = np.where(valid, 1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    return scores

This way, bins that can fit the item get a priority score inversely proportional to the remaining space after placing the item. Bins that can't fit get -infinity. This should implement a Best Fit-like heuristic but with a more aggressive prioritization of tighter fits.

But wait, what if two bins have the same remaining_after? Then their scores are the same, and the one with the lower index (earlier bin) would be selected. That's acceptable.

Another test case: item is 0.3. Bin1 has remaining_cap 0.3 → remaining_after 0.0 → score 1/(0.0 + 1e-9) = 1e9. Bin2 has remaining_cap 0.4 → remaining_after 0.1 → score 10. So Bin1 is selected. That's correct.

Another case: item is 0.3. Bin1 has remaining_cap 0.4 (score 1/0.1=10), Bin2 has 0.5 (score 1/0.2=5). So Bin1 is selected. Correct.

This approach should work well. So the code for priority_v2 is as above.
