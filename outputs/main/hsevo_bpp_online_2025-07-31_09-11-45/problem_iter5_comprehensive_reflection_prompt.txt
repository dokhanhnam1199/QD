{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective heuristics require: 1) Synergistic balance of competing objectives via multiplicative/geometric means 2) Precision-aware exact fit handling 3) Calibrated epsilon constants for numerical stability 4) Avoidance of ungrounded complexity (quantum/entropic metaphors). Optimal solutions emerge from principled tradeoffs, not additive feature creep.\nEffective heuristics: 1) Balance tight packing with future flexibility using theoretically grounded ratios 2) Handle floating precision rigorously 3) Prefer smooth score gradients over abrupt boosts 4) Combine factors multiplicatively only when they represent independent dimensions 5) Favor interpretable physics/math metaphors over arbitrary biological/cosmic analogies.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
