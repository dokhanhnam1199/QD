Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin when a new item arrives, so that the bin with the highest score gets the item. Let me think about different heuristics that could work better than the trivial version.

First, the existing priority_v1 returns all zeros, which probably just picks the first bin or something. Not useful. So for v2, I need a smarter approach.

Common bin packing heuristics include Best Fit, which places the item in the bin with the least remaining space that can still fit the item. But how to translate that into a priority score. Maybe the priority is the remaining capacity after placing the item, but only if it fits. For bins that can't fit the item, their priority should be very low (like negative infinity) so they are not chosen.

Wait, but the function needs to return a score for each bin. So for each bin, if the bin's remaining capacity is >= item size, then calculate a score, else set a very low value. For Best Fit, the score would be (remaining_cap - item), which is the space left after adding the item. The bin with the smallest remaining space (i.e., largest score in this case) would be chosen. Wait, no: if you subtract the item from the remaining cap, then the bin that has remaining_cap exactly equal to the item would have a score of 0. Bins with more space would have higher scores. Wait, no: if remaining_cap is 0.8, item is 0.5, then remaining_cap - item is 0.3. But Best Fit would prefer the bin where remaining_cap - item is as small as possible (so that the remaining space is minimized). So maybe the priority should be (remaining_cap - item), but we want to maximize that? No, because Best Fit picks the bin that leaves the smallest possible space. So for example, if two bins have remaining capacities 0.6 and 0.4, and the item is 0.5, the first bin can't take it (0.6-0.5=0.1, but wait, 0.6 is the remaining capacity. Wait, the item's size is 0.5. So the bin's remaining capacity must be >= item. So in this case, the first bin (0.6) can take the item, leaving 0.1. The second bin (0.4) can't. So Best Fit would choose the first bin. So the priority for a bin that can take the item is (remaining_cap - item), and we want the smallest such value. But since the priority function returns a score where higher is better, we need to invert that. So maybe the priority is -(remaining_cap - item), so that the smallest remaining space gives the highest priority. But for bins that can't fit, their priority is set to -infinity or a very low value.

Alternatively, for bins that can fit the item, the priority is (remaining_cap - item) but multiplied by -1. So the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) (i.e., tightest fit) gets the highest score. For bins that can't fit, their priority is -infinity. So the code would compute for each bin: if bin_remain >= item, then -(bin_remain - item), else -inf. Then the bin with the highest score (i.e., the tightest fit) is selected. That's the Best Fit approach.

But maybe there are other heuristics. For example, First Fit, which just picks the first bin that can fit. But that's not a priority-based approach. Alternatively, Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the most remaining space, to leave larger spaces for future items. In that case, the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit, and we want the largest value. So the priority is (remaining_cap - item) for valid bins, and -inf otherwise. Then the bin with the highest remaining space after placing the item is chosen.

But the user is asking for a creative approach. Maybe combining multiple factors. For example, considering both the fit and the current utilization of the bin. Or maybe a heuristic that tries to balance between tight packing and leaving some space for potential future items.

Another idea: prioritize bins where adding the item would result in a remaining capacity that's a multiple of a certain value. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining space is 0.2, which is a common item size, that's good. But how to encode that without knowing future items?

Alternatively, use a scoring function that combines the remaining capacity after placing the item and the current remaining capacity. For example, a weighted sum of (remaining_cap - item) and remaining_cap. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the online scenario, we don't know future items, so heuristics have to be based on current state. Best Fit is known to perform reasonably well. But maybe there's a variation that can be better.

Another approach: the priority could be the reciprocal of the remaining capacity after placing the item. So for bins that can fit, priority is 1/(remaining_cap - item + epsilon) to avoid division by zero. This way, bins that leave less space have higher priority. But this is similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a function that gives higher scores to bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is a small fraction of the bin's total capacity. For example, (1 - (remaining_cap - item)/bin_capacity), but since bin_capacity is fixed (assuming all bins are same size, which they are in BPP), this is equivalent to (bin_capacity - (remaining_cap - item)) / bin_capacity. But bin_capacity is fixed, so it's proportional to (bin_capacity - remaining_cap + item) = (item + (bin_capacity - remaining_cap)). The (bin_capacity - remaining_cap) is the used space in the bin. So this would prioritize bins where the used space plus the item is higher. But that's the same as the used space after adding the item. So the priority is the sum of the current used space plus the item. Which is the same as (bin_capacity - remaining_cap) + item. But since bin_capacity is fixed, this is (item - remaining_cap) + bin_capacity. But this might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the current used space and the item. So for a bin, the used space is (original capacity - remaining_cap). Adding the item would make it (original capacity - remaining_cap + item). The priority is this value. So higher used space after adding the item is better. But this is equivalent to (original capacity - (remaining_cap - item)), which is the same as (original capacity + item - remaining_cap). But original capacity is fixed, so the priority is (item - remaining_cap) plus a constant. But this is similar to Best Fit, which is (remaining_cap - item). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the priority is the remaining capacity after placing the item. For Best Fit, we want the smallest such value, so the priority is negative of that. For Worst Fit, we want the largest, so priority is the value itself. But the user wants a priority function, so perhaps the Best Fit approach is a good starting point.

So, for priority_v2, implementing Best Fit:

For each bin, if the bin's remaining capacity >= item, compute (remaining_cap - item), and assign the priority as -(remaining_cap - item) so that the smallest (tightest) fit has the highest priority. Bins that can't fit get a very low priority, like -infinity.

Wait, but in code, how to handle that. Let's see.

In code:

def priority_v2(...):
    # compute for each bin
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # for bins that can fit, compute (remaining_cap - item)
    # priority is -(remaining_cap - item) to prefer smaller remaining space
    # for bins that can't fit, set to -inf
    scores = np.where(can_fit, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)
    return scores

Wait, but in that case, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) would have the highest score. For example, if a bin has remaining_cap 0.5 and item is 0.5, then (remaining_cap - item) is 0, so score is 0. Another bin with remaining_cap 0.6 and item 0.5 would have (0.1) and score -0.1. So the first bin (score 0) is better. That's correct for Best Fit.

But wait, the priority is the score. So the highest score is selected. So in this case, the bin that can exactly fit the item (remaining_cap == item) would have a score of 0. Any other bin that can fit would have a negative score (since (remaining_cap - item) is positive, so -(that) is negative). Wait, no. For example, if remaining_cap is 0.6 and item is 0.5, then (0.6 - 0.5) is 0.1, so the score is -0.1. The bin with remaining_cap 0.5 (exact fit) has a score of 0. So the exact fit bin is selected. That's correct.

But if there are multiple bins that can fit, the one with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) (i.e., the tightest fit) will have the highest score (since -(remaining_cap - item) is largest when (remaining_cap - item) is smallest). For example, if two bins have remaining capacities 0.5 and 0.6. The item is 0.5. The first bin's score is 0, the second's is -0.1. So the first is selected. Correct.

But if the item is 0.4, and two bins have remaining capacities 0.5 and 0.6. Then (0.5-0.4)=0.1, score -0.1. (0.6-0.4)=0.2, score -0.2. So the first bin (score -0.1) is better. So the tightest fit is selected. That's Best Fit.

So this code would implement Best Fit. But the user might want a different heuristic. But the problem says to be creative. Maybe combining Best Fit with another factor.

Alternatively, maybe a heuristic that considers both the remaining capacity after placing the item and the current utilization. For example, a bin that is almost full except for this item might be better. Or perhaps, the priority is the sum of the used space plus the item. For example, (original_cap - remaining_cap) + item. But original_cap is fixed (assuming all bins are the same size, which they are in BPP). So the priority would be (original_cap - remaining_cap + item). But original_cap is a constant, so it's (item - remaining_cap) + original_cap. But this is equivalent to (original_cap + item - remaining_cap). Since original_cap is fixed, this is the same as (item - remaining_cap) plus a constant. So the priority is higher when (item - remaining_cap) is higher. But (item - remaining_cap) is the same as -(remaining_cap - item). So this is similar to the Best Fit approach. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the priority is the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity. For example, item / remaining_cap. But this would be higher for bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining space. But this would prioritize bins where the item is a large fraction of the remaining capacity. For example, if a bin has 0.6 remaining, and the item is 0.5, the ratio is 0.5/0.6 ≈ 0.83. If another bin has 0.5 remaining, the ratio is 1.0. So the second bin is better. So this is similar to Best Fit, but the ratio is considered. So the priority would be item / remaining_cap for bins that can fit. But in this case, higher ratio is better. So the code would be:

scores = np.where(can_fit, item / bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

This would give higher scores to bins where the item takes a larger portion of the remaining space. For example, a bin with remaining 0.5 and item 0.5 gives 1.0. A bin with remaining 0.6 and item 0.5 gives 0.833. So the first bin is selected. That's the same as Best Fit. But maybe this approach is different in some cases. For example, if two bins have remaining capacities 0.3 and 0.4, and the item is 0.2. The first bin's ratio is 0.2/0.3 ≈ 0.666, the second is 0.2/0.4=0.5. So the first bin is better. Best Fit would choose the first bin (remaining after is 0.1) over the second (remaining after is 0.2). So same result. So this ratio approach is similar to Best Fit.

But perhaps combining multiple factors. For example, a weighted sum of the remaining capacity after placing the item and the ratio. But without knowing future items, it's hard to say which is better.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining capacity is 0.1, which is a common small item size. But how to encode that without knowing future items. Maybe assume that small items are more common. So if the remaining capacity after placing the item is a small value (like 0.1), give higher priority. So the priority could be 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) if (remaining_cap - item) is small. But this is similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) but inverted. So the smaller the (remaining_cap - item), the higher the priority. Which is exactly what the Best Fit code does.

But the user wants a creative approach. Maybe a heuristic that tries to leave the remaining capacity as a value that's a multiple of the average item size seen so far. But since this is online, we don't have that information. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that combines Best Fit with a penalty for bins that are almost full. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity after adding the item is very small (like 0.1), maybe that's good. But if it's a medium value (like 0.5), maybe that's worse. So the priority could be higher for bins that leave a very small remaining capacity, but lower for those that leave a medium. But how to model that.

Alternatively, use a sigmoid function to prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after adding the item is close to zero. For example, the priority is 1 / (1 + exp(-k*(x - c))) where x is (remaining_cap - item), and k and c are parameters. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, use a piecewise function. For example, if (remaining_cap - item) is less than 0.2, then priority is 1.0. If between 0.2 and 0.5, priority is 0.5. Else, 0.0. But this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, the priority could be the square of (remaining_cap - item) but inverted. So -( (remaining_cap - item) )^2. This would penalize larger remaining capacities more. For example, a remaining of 0.1 would have a score of -0.01, while 0.2 would be -0.04. So the smaller the remaining, the higher the score (since -0.01 is higher than -0.04). So this would also select the tightest fit, similar to Best Fit.

But perhaps the user wants a different approach. Let's think of other heuristics.

Another idea: the "Almost Full" heuristic. Prioritize bins that are almost full (i.e., their remaining capacity is just enough to fit the item). For example, if a bin has remaining capacity exactly equal to the item, that's the best. If not, then the next best is the bin with the smallest remaining capacity that can still fit the item. Which is again Best Fit.

Alternatively, consider the sum of the current used space and the item. The higher the sum, the better. For example, used space is (original_cap - remaining_cap). Adding the item gives (original_cap - remaining_cap + item). The priority is this value. So higher values are better. This would prefer bins where adding the item would make them as full as possible. Which is the same as Best Fit, because (original_cap - remaining_cap + item) = original_cap - (remaining_cap - item). So maximizing this is equivalent to minimizing (remaining_cap - item), which is Best Fit.

So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the way to go. But the user wants a creative v2. Maybe the code for Best Fit is what they want. But the example given in the problem statement is a trivial v1, and the user wants a better v2.

So the answer would be to implement Best Fit as the priority function. Let's code that.

Wait, but in the code, the bins_remain_cap is an array of the remaining capacities. So for each bin, check if it can fit the item. If yes, compute the remaining capacity after placing the item (remaining_cap - item), and assign the priority as the negative of that (so that the smallest remaining gets the highest priority). Bins that can't fit get a very low priority.

So the code would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # For bins that can fit, priority is -(remaining_after) to prefer tighter fits
    # For bins that can't fit, set to -infinity
    priorities = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return priorities

This code first checks which bins can fit the item. For those that can, it calculates the remaining capacity after placing the item. The priority is the negative of that value, so bins with smaller remaining_after (tighter fits) have higher priorities. Bins that can't fit get -infinity, so they are not selected.

This should implement the Best Fit heuristic. But the user might consider this a standard approach. However, the problem says to be creative. Maybe there's a more innovative approach.

Alternatively, maybe a hybrid approach. For example, prioritize bins that can fit the item and have the smallest remaining capacity, but also have a certain minimum remaining capacity. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining capacity is at least 0.1, to allow for future small items. But this requires knowing future items, which is not possible in online BPP.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that combines Best Fit with a look-ahead for potential future items. But again, online BPP doesn't allow that.

Another idea: the priority could be the remaining capacity of the bin after placing the item, but inverted. So for bins that can fit, priority is 1/(remaining_after + epsilon), where epsilon is a small value to prevent division by zero. This way, bins with smaller remaining_after have higher priorities. This is similar to Best Fit but uses a different scoring mechanism.

In code:

def priority_v2(...):
    epsilon = 1e-9
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    priorities = np.where(can_fit, 1/(remaining_after + epsilon), -np.inf)
    return priorities

This would assign higher scores to bins with smaller remaining_after. For example, if remaining_after is 0.1, the priority is 10. If it's 0.2, priority is 5. So the bin with 0.1 is selected. This is similar to Best Fit but uses reciprocal.

But this approach might have numerical issues if remaining_after is very small. But with epsilon, it's manageable.

Alternatively, use the negative of remaining_after, which is the same as the first approach. So the first code example (using -remaining_after) is equivalent to Best Fit.

But the user might want a different heuristic. Let's think of another approach.

Another heuristic: the "Worst Fit" which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining capacity after placing the item. This is the opposite of Best Fit. The priority would be remaining_after for bins that can fit. So the code would be:

priorities = np.where(can_fit, remaining_after, -np.inf)

Then the bin with the highest remaining_after (largest space after adding the item) is chosen. This is Worst Fit.

But the user asked for a creative approach. Maybe combining Best Fit and Worst Fit based on some condition. For example, if the item is large, use Best Fit; if small, use Worst Fit. But how to determine the threshold.

Alternatively, use a dynamic approach where the priority is a weighted average between Best Fit and another heuristic. But without knowing future items, it's hard to adjust the weights.

Alternatively, consider the number of items already in the bin. For example, prefer bins with more items, as they are more utilized. But the bins_remain_cap array doesn't provide the number of items, only the remaining capacity. So this information isn't available.

Another idea: prioritize bins where the item size is close to the remaining capacity. For example, the priority is the negative absolute difference between the item size and the remaining capacity. So bins that have remaining capacity close to the item size get higher priority. This is similar to Best Fit but allows for some flexibility. For example, if the item is 0.5, a bin with remaining 0.5 is perfect (difference 0), but a bin with remaining 0.6 (difference 0.1) is better than one with 0.4 (difference 0.1). But this would prioritize bins that can fit the item exactly. For bins that can't fit, they are ignored.

But this is similar to Best Fit, but with a different metric. For example, if a bin has remaining 0.5 and item is 0.5: difference is 0. If a bin has remaining 0.6 and item 0.5: difference is 0.1. So the first bin is better. But if a bin has remaining 0.4 and item 0.3: difference is 0.1. Another bin has remaining 0.5 and item 0.3: difference 0.2. So the first bin is better. But this approach might not be as effective as Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be the negative of (remaining_cap - item) squared. So bins that have remaining_cap close to item get higher priority. This would prefer bins where the item fills the bin as much as possible. For example, if remaining_cap is 0.5 and item is 0.5: (0.5-0.5)^2=0, priority is 0. If remaining_cap is 0.6 and item 0.5: (0.1)^2=0.01, priority is -0.01. So the first bin is better. This is similar to Best Fit.

But perhaps the user wants a different approach. Let's think of a heuristic that tries to balance the load across bins. For example, after placing the item, the remaining capacities of the bins should be as uniform as possible. But this is complex to model in a priority function.

Alternatively, the priority could be based on the sum of the squares of the remaining capacities. This is similar to the "variance" minimization approach. But again, this is more complex.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that prefers bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is a multiple of the item size. For example, if the item is 0.3, and a bin has remaining capacity 0.6, then after placing the item, remaining is 0.3, which is a multiple. This might allow for future items of the same size to fit. But this requires knowing future items, which we don't have.

But in the online scenario, this is not possible. So this approach isn't feasible.

Another idea: prioritize bins that have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain fraction, like 0.5. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining capacity is 0.5, which is a common size. But again, without knowing future items, this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but with a bonus for certain values. For example, if remaining_after is 0.0 (exact fit), give a high priority. Otherwise, use Best Fit.

But this is already covered in the Best Fit approach.

After considering various options, the Best Fit heuristic seems to be a solid and effective approach for the priority function. So the code for priority_v2 would implement Best Fit by assigning priorities as the negative of the remaining capacity after placing the item for bins that can fit, and -infinity otherwise.
