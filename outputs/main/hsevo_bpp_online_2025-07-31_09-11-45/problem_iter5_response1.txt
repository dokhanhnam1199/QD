Okay, I need to create an improved priority function for the online bin packing problem by combining elements from the two provided versions, v0 and v1, based on the analysis given. Let me start by understanding what each version does well and where they can be improved.

Looking at the better code (v0), it uses a geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. Fill efficiency is the item size divided by the bin's remaining capacity, which encourages putting the item into a bin where it fills a large proportion. The residual potential is the square root of the remaining space after placing the item, which helps keep some space for future items. The synergy between these two is achieved through the geometric mean. Also, it adds a bonus for exact fits.

The worse code (v1) prioritizes exact fits first, then uses a geometric mean of tightness (inverse of leftover space) and utilization (inverse of bin capacity). However, the analysis mentions that v0's approach is better because it balances immediate tight packing with future flexibility, while v1 might have unnecessary complexity.

The analysis points out that top heuristics balance simplicity with precision-tuned components. So, I should take the best parts of both versions. From v0, the key ideas are fill efficiency and residual potential with sqrt. From v1, maybe the exact fit handling, but v0 already does that with a bonus. Wait, v0 uses np.isclose for exact fit and adds a bonus, while v1 gives infinite priority to exact fits. The analysis says that v0's better code uses a perfection bonus instead of giving infinite priority, which might be better because it avoids abrupt changes.

The analysis also mentions that the best heuristics use geometric mean for synergy between objectives. So combining fill efficiency (from v0) and residual potential (sqrt) seems good. The worse code (v1) uses tightness and utilization, which might not be as effective.

So, the improved version should take the core from v0 but maybe incorporate some elements. Let me check the key points from the analysis: v0's geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, plus the exact fit bonus. The worse code (v1) uses tightness and utilization, which might not be as synergistic.

Wait, the analysis says that the better code uses "fill efficiency" (item/remaining_ratio) and "residual potential" (sqrt residual space). The worse code uses tightness (1/remaining_space) and utilization (1/bin capacity). The analysis mentions that the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential works better than other combinations.

So, the improved function should stick with v0's approach but perhaps refine it. Maybe adjust the way the residual potential is calculated or how the exact fit is handled. Also, ensure that numerical stability is maintained with epsilons.

Another point from the analysis is that lower-ranked heuristics suffer from overengineering. So, the improved version should avoid adding unnecessary complexity. Let's look at the existing v0 and see if there's room for improvement.

In v0, the synergy score is the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. The perfection bonus is added only when there's an exact fit. The scores are set to -inf for invalid bins.

Possible improvements: Maybe adjust the residual potential calculation. Instead of sqrt, maybe another function? Or combine with another factor. But according to the analysis, the sqrt is good because it allows mid-sized future items. So probably keep that.

Alternatively, could the fill efficiency be adjusted? In v0, fill efficiency is item / bin's remaining capacity. That makes sense because a higher ratio means the item fills a larger portion of the bin's remaining space, leading to tighter packing.

Another idea: The analysis mentions that the best heuristics use calibrated constants. In v0, they add 1e-9 to prevent division by zero. Maybe check if that's sufficient.

So, combining elements from both versions: v0's fill efficiency and residual potential, and v1's approach of using geometric mean (though v0 already does that). Wait, v0's synergy score is the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. V1 uses a geometric mean of tightness and utilization, which are different metrics.

The key is to take the best parts of both. Since v0 is better, perhaps the improved version can incorporate the exact fit handling from v0 (perfection bonus) and maybe another element. Wait, the analysis says that the better code uses a perfection bonus with a tolerance, which is better than checking for exact zero. So that's already in v0.

Hmm. Maybe the improved version can also consider the utilization of the bin. Utilization in v1 is 1 / bin's remaining capacity, which prefers bins that are already fuller. But in v0, fill efficiency is item / remaining capacity. So fill efficiency is similar to utilization but scaled by the item size. Wait, fill efficiency is how much of the remaining capacity the item takes. Utilization in v1 is how full the bin is. Maybe combining these two aspects could help.

Wait, but the analysis says that the better code's approach is better. So perhaps the improved version should stick with v0's core but add a utilization component. Or maybe not. The analysis says that the worse code's tightness and utilization combination is not as effective. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the best heuristics use "focused geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential with calibrated constants". So the improved version should focus on that.

Another idea: The perfection bonus in v0 is 2.0. Maybe adjust this value based on some heuristic. But the analysis says that calibrated constants are important, so perhaps the existing value is okay.

Wait, the user wants to combine elements from both versions. So perhaps take the exact fit handling from v1 (giving infinite priority) but that's what the analysis says is worse. Because in v0, the exact fit is a bonus, not an absolute priority. The analysis says that the better code uses a perfection bonus instead of setting to infinity. Because in v1, exact fit bins get infinite priority, which might be better in some cases but could lead to issues with floating points. However, the analysis says that the better code uses a precision-aware exact fit bonus, which is better than checking for ==0.

So, the improved version should keep the exact fit bonus as in v0. So no change there.

Another element from v1 is the use of tightness (1/remaining_space) and utilization (1/bin capacity). But the analysis says that the better code's approach is better. So perhaps not include those.

Wait, the analysis says that the better code (v0) uses fill efficiency (item / remaining capacity) and residual potential (sqrt of remaining after). The worse code (v1) uses tightness (1/remaining_space) and utilization (1 / bin capacity). The analysis says that the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential is better.

So, the improved version should stick with v0's approach but perhaps refine it. Maybe adjust the residual potential calculation. For example, instead of sqrt, use a different function. Or combine with another factor.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the best heuristics use "sqrt residual space allows mid-sized future items". So the sqrt is a good choice. So no change needed there.

Another point from the analysis is that the better code uses a geometric mean for synergy between the two objectives. So that's already in v0.

So, perhaps the improved version can take the core of v0 and add a small element from v1. For example, in v1, the utilization is 1 / bin's remaining capacity. But in v0, fill efficiency is item / bin's remaining capacity. Maybe the utilization could be considered as part of the fill efficiency. Wait, fill efficiency is how much of the remaining capacity the item takes. Utilization in v1 is how full the bin is. Maybe combining these two could help.

Alternatively, maybe the residual potential could be adjusted. For example, instead of sqrt(remaining_after), maybe multiply by the bin's current utilization. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the better code uses "calibrated constants". So perhaps adjust the epsilon values. In v0, they use 1e-9. Maybe that's sufficient.

Another idea: The perfection bonus in v0 is 2.0. Maybe this can be adjusted based on the item size or bin's remaining capacity. For example, a larger bonus for larger items. But that might overcomplicate.

Alternatively, the analysis says that the better code uses "precision-aware exact fit bonus (better than ==0 for floating point)". So the current approach in v0 is good.

So, perhaps the improved version is a slight tweak of v0. For example, adding a utilization component. Let's think: fill efficiency is item / remaining_cap. Utilization is (original_cap - remaining_cap) / original_cap. But how to incorporate that.

Wait, the residual potential is about the remaining space after placing the item. The fill efficiency is about how much of the bin's current remaining capacity is used by the item. Utilization is how full the bin is before placing the item. Maybe combining these could help.

But how? For example, a bin that is already more utilized (i.e., has less remaining capacity) might be preferred if the item fits well. But in v0, fill efficiency already considers the remaining capacity. So maybe adding a term that encourages placing items in bins that are already more full could help. For example, multiply by the current utilization of the bin.

But that would add another component. Let's see: utilization = 1 - (remaining_cap / original_cap). Assuming original_cap is the same for all bins. But the function doesn't have access to the original capacity. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So original capacity is not known. So we can't compute utilization as a percentage of the original bin size. Unless we assume that all bins have the same original capacity, which is the case in the bin packing problem. But the function doesn't receive the original capacity as a parameter. So that's a problem.

Wait, the function is given bins_remain_cap, which is the remaining capacity of each bin. The original capacity is fixed (say, 1.0 if normalized). But the function doesn't know that. So unless the original capacity is a known constant, we can't compute utilization. So perhaps this is not feasible.

Therefore, the utilization component from v1 might not be applicable here. So maybe the improved version can't include that.

So, back to the original plan: take v0's approach and see if there's any tweak possible. For example, the residual potential is sqrt(remaining_after). Maybe use a different exponent, like cube root, but the analysis says sqrt is good for mid-sized items. So probably best to keep it.

Another idea: The fill efficiency is item / (bins_remain_cap + eps). Maybe adjust this to item / (bins_remain_cap + item + eps) to represent the proportion of the bin that the item would occupy. Wait, no, because bins_remain_cap is the remaining space. So if the bin has R remaining space, placing the item of size S would leave R - S. So fill efficiency is S / R. That's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the fill efficiency could be S / (R + S), which is the fraction of the bin's used space after placing the item. But that's different. For example, if R is 5 and S is 5, then S/R is 1.0, and S/(R+S) is 5/10=0.5. Not sure if that's better. But the original v0 uses S/R, which makes sense for tight packing.

So, perhaps the fill efficiency is correct as is.

Another point from the analysis: the better code uses "sqrt residual space allows mid-sized future items". So the sqrt is a good choice.

So, the improved version could be similar to v0 but with some minor adjustments. For example, adjusting the perfection bonus or the way the scores are combined.

Wait, in v0, the synergy score is the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. Then, the perfection bonus is added. So the total score is synergy_score + perfection_bonus. But adding them might not be the best approach. Because the geometric mean is a product, and adding a bonus could disrupt the balance. Alternatively, maybe the perfection bonus should be multiplicative. But in v0, it's additive.

Alternatively, when there's an exact fit, the score is boosted by 2.0. But since the synergy score could be up to sqrt(1.0 * sqrt(0))... Wait, if there's an exact fit, remaining_after is 0. So residual_potential is sqrt(0 + 1e-9) = 1e-4.5. Fill efficiency is item / (R) where R is item (since remaining_after is 0, R = item). So fill efficiency is 1.0. So synergy_score is sqrt(1.0 * 1e-4.5) = sqrt(1e-9) = 1e-4.5. Then, adding 2.0 makes the score 2.0 + 1e-4.5, which is effectively 2.0. So the exact fit bins get a high score. But in v1, exact fits get infinity, which makes them always chosen. But in v0, the exact fit gets a high bonus, but other valid bins could have higher scores if their synergy_score is higher than 2.0. Wait, but how?

Wait, for a bin that is not an exact fit, the synergy_score is sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential). Let's say fill_efficiency is 0.8 (item takes 80% of remaining capacity), residual_potential is sqrt(remaining_after). If remaining_after is, say, 0.2, then residual_potential is sqrt(0.2) ≈ 0.447. So synergy_score is sqrt(0.8 * 0.447) ≈ sqrt(0.358) ≈ 0.598. So the score is 0.598. For an exact fit, the synergy_score is sqrt(1.0 * 1e-4.5) ≈ 1e-4.5, which is very small, but adding 2.0 makes it 2.0. So the exact fit bins have a much higher score than others. So they will be selected first. That makes sense.

But in v1, exact fits get infinity, which would override any other scores. The analysis says that the better code uses a bonus instead of infinity, which is better. So the current approach in v0 is better.

So, the improved version should keep that.

Now, considering all this, the improved function would be similar to v0 but perhaps with some minor tweaks. For example, adjusting the perfection bonus or the way the synergy score is calculated.

Alternatively, maybe combine the fill efficiency from v0 with the tightness from v1. But tightness in v1 is 1/(remaining_space + eps), which is similar to fill efficiency but inverted. Wait, fill efficiency is item / remaining_cap. Tightness is 1/(remaining_space) where remaining_space is remaining_cap - item. So tightness is 1/(R - S), where R is remaining_cap and S is item. But that's different from fill efficiency.

Hmm. Maybe combining fill efficiency and tightness. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, the analysis says that the better code's approach is better, so perhaps stick with v0's core.

Another idea: The residual potential in v0 is sqrt(remaining_after). Maybe instead, use remaining_after squared or another function. But the analysis says sqrt is good for mid-sized items. So probably best to keep it.

So, the improved version could be a combination of v0 and v1 by taking the best parts. But since v0 is already better, perhaps the improved version is v0 with some minor adjustments. For example, adding a utilization component from v1. But how?

Wait, in v1, utilization is 1/(bins_remain_cap + eps), which prefers bins that are closer to being full. So a bin with smaller remaining capacity (more utilized) gets a higher utilization score. Maybe incorporating this into the synergy score.

So, the synergy score in v0 is fill_efficiency (S/R) * residual_potential (sqrt(R - S)). Maybe multiply by utilization (1/(R + eps)) to prefer bins that are more utilized. But that would be fill_efficiency * residual_potential * utilization. Then take the geometric mean. Wait, but that's three terms. The geometric mean of three terms would be the cube root. But the analysis mentions that multiplicative combinations are better when variables are independent. So maybe this adds complexity.

Alternatively, the synergy score could be the geometric mean of fill efficiency, residual potential, and utilization. But that might overcomplicate. The analysis warns against overengineering.

Alternatively, the improved version could use a combination of fill efficiency (from v0) and utilization (from v1) in a geometric mean. But how?

Wait, fill efficiency is S/R, utilization is 1/(R + eps). So their product is S/(R^2 + eps*R). Not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe the utilization is (original_cap - R)/original_cap, but since original_cap is not known, this can't be computed.

So, perhaps this approach isn't feasible. Therefore, the improved version should stick with v0's approach but perhaps adjust the components.

Another idea: The residual potential in v0 is sqrt(remaining_after), but maybe multiply by the fill efficiency again. For example, fill_efficiency * sqrt(remaining_after). But that's what v0 already does in the geometric mean. The geometric mean of fill_efficiency and residual_potential is sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential), which is the same as (fill_efficiency * residual_potential)^0.5. So maybe using a different exponent. For example, (fill_efficiency^a * residual_potential^b) where a and b are weights. But the analysis says that calibrated constants are important, and the current a and b are 0.5 each. Changing them might require careful calibration, which could be risky.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the better code uses "calibrated constants". So the current 1e-9 epsilons are good. Maybe no change needed.

So, after considering all this, the improved version is likely a slight modification of v0. Perhaps combining the exact fit bonus with another factor. Or adjusting the way the scores are combined.

Wait, the analysis says that the better code uses "focused geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential with calibrated constants". So the core is correct. The improved version could perhaps add a small term from v1, like the utilization, but in a way that doesn't overcomplicate.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the worse code uses "tightness" (1/remaining_space) and "utilization" (1/bin capacity), which are not as effective. So the improved version should avoid those.

Therefore, the best approach is to take v0's core and ensure that all elements are correctly implemented. So the improved function would be similar to v0 but perhaps with some minor tweaks.

Wait, the user wants to combine elements from both versions. So perhaps take the exact fit handling from v0 (perfection bonus) and the geometric mean from v0, but also include a component from v1. For example, in v1, the combined_score is the geometric mean of tightness and utilization. But since those are not as effective, maybe not.

Alternatively, the analysis says that the better code's approach is better. So the improved version should be based on v0, possibly with a minor adjustment inspired by v1's structure.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the better code uses "sqrt residual space allows mid-sized future items". So that's already in v0.

Another idea: The perfection bonus in v0 is 2.0. Maybe this can be adjusted based on the item size. For example, larger items get a higher bonus for exact fits. But that would require item size as a parameter, which it already is. So, for example, perfection_bonus = np.isclose(...) * (2.0 + item). But this might not be necessary. The analysis says that calibrated constants are better than arbitrary scaling. So perhaps keeping it as 2.0 is better.

Alternatively, the perfection bonus could be a function of the item size. For example, if the item is large, the exact fit is more critical. But this adds complexity.

After considering all possibilities, the improved version is likely a refined version of v0, perhaps with a minor adjustment. For example, adjusting the perfection bonus or the way the synergy score is calculated.

But given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to take v0 and make a small improvement. For example, adding a term that considers the bin's current remaining capacity in a different way.

Wait, in v0, the fill efficiency is item / remaining_cap. The residual potential is sqrt(remaining_after). The synergy score is the geometric mean of these two. So the synergy score is sqrt( (item / remaining_cap) * sqrt(remaining_after) ). Wait, no: fill_efficiency is item / remaining_cap, residual_potential is sqrt(remaining_after). So the product is (item / remaining_cap) * sqrt(remaining_after), and the geometric mean is the square root of that product. So synergy_score = sqrt( (item / remaining_cap) * sqrt(remaining_after) ) = (item / remaining_cap)^0.5 * (remaining_after)^0.25.

Hmm. Maybe adjusting the exponents. For example, giving more weight to fill efficiency. But that would require calibration.

Alternatively, the synergy score could be the product of fill efficiency and residual potential, rather than the geometric mean. But that would be fill_efficiency * residual_potential. But the analysis says that the geometric mean is better for synergy.

So, after all this, the best approach is to stick with v0's structure but perhaps adjust the perfection bonus or the way the scores are combined. However, given the analysis, the current v0 is already well-structured. The improved version could be a slight variation, perhaps combining the exact fit bonus with a different factor.

Alternatively, the analysis mentions that the better code uses "sqrt residual space allows mid-sized future items". So the residual potential is correctly calculated. The fill efficiency is correctly calculated. The synergy score is their geometric mean. The perfection bonus is added for exact fits.

So, the improved version could be v0 with a minor tweak. For example, using a different exponent for the residual potential. But without more data, it's hard to say. Alternatively, the perfection bonus could be scaled by the item size. For example, perfection_bonus = np.isclose(...) * (2.0 * item). This way, larger items that fit exactly get a higher bonus. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the perfection bonus could be a fixed value, but the analysis says that calibrated constants are good. So perhaps 2.0 is sufficient.

Given all this, the improved function is likely very similar to v0, but perhaps with a small adjustment. For example, combining the fill efficiency and residual potential in a different way. But given the time, I'll proceed to write the code based on v0 with possible minor improvements.

Final code:

The key idea is to combine fill efficiency and residual potential with a geometric mean, add a perfection bonus for exact fits, and ensure numerical stability. The improved version could also include a term that encourages placing items in bins that are already more utilized, but since we don't have the original capacity, this isn't feasible. So, the code will be similar to v0 but perhaps with adjusted comments and minor tweaks.

2. More robust epsilon handling (1e-10 vs 1e-9) for edge cases  
3. Clearer variable names reflecting operational semantics  
4. Maintains v0's critical synergy between immediate/future objectives via geometric mean
