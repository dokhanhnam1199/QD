<think>
Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here. The goal is to pack items into the fewest bins possible. So, the priority function should determine which bin is best to place the current item into, based on the remaining capacities.

First, I remember that common heuristics for bin packing include First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. Best Fit tries to place the item in the bin that leaves the least space left, which might be efficient. But maybe there's a way to combine different strategies or add some dynamic elements.

Wait, the priority function returns a score for each bin. The bin with the highest score gets the item. So, for each bin, I need to calculate a score based on how suitable it is to place the item there.

Let me think about possible factors. The remaining capacity after placing the item is important. If a bin has exactly enough space, that's perfect. Also, maybe bins that are almost full but can still fit the item should be prioritized. Alternatively, leaving bins with a small remaining capacity might be good because they can't take many more items, so filling them up is better.

Another idea: consider the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity. If the item fits perfectly (item == remaining capacity), that's the best case. So maybe give a very high priority to bins where the remaining capacity is exactly the item size. For other bins, maybe prioritize those where the remaining capacity is just a bit larger than the item, to minimize leftover space.

But also, we might want to avoid creating very small leftover spaces, which can't fit future items. For example, if placing the item leaves a small fragment, that's bad. So perhaps the priority should balance between fitting the item tightly and leaving space that's useful for other items.

Hmm. Let's formalize this. For each bin, calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item (if possible). If the bin can't fit the item, the priority is zero or negative. For bins that can fit it, the priority could be based on the remaining space after insertion. But Best Fit would choose the bin with the smallest remaining space. So the priority would be higher for smaller remaining space. But how to represent that as a score.

Alternatively, maybe use a combination of factors. For example, the score could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but inverted. So higher scores for smaller remaining capacities. But also, maybe add a bonus for bins that are almost full, to encourage filling them up.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the "Best Fit" heuristic but with a twist. Let's compute for each bin the remaining capacity after inserting the item. Then, the priority is the negative of that remaining capacity. So bins that have the least remaining space after insertion get the highest priority. That's exactly Best Fit. But maybe we can add another term to the priority to handle edge cases better.

Alternatively, maybe use a weighted combination of factors. For example, the priority could be (remaining_capacity - item) if the item fits, else -infinity. But that's just Best Fit. But perhaps we can add a term that gives a higher score when the remaining capacity after insertion is a multiple of some value, like the average item size seen so far. But since this is online, we don't have future items' information.

Wait, but the problem is online, so the algorithm can't look ahead. So the heuristic must be based only on the current item and the current bins.

Another approach: prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is as close as possible to zero. So, the priority could be 1/(remaining_capacity_after + epsilon), where epsilon is a small value to prevent division by zero. Bins that can't fit the item get zero priority.

But division might lead to very high values when the remaining capacity is very small. That would heavily prioritize those bins, which is what Best Fit does. So this would be similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe use a different function. For example, the priority could be (remaining_capacity_after) but inverted. So for a bin that can fit the item, the priority is (bin_remaining_cap - item). Wait, no. If the bin's remaining capacity is 5, and the item is 3, then after insertion, the remaining is 2. So the priority would be 5-3=2. But if another bin has remaining 4, and the item is 3, then after insertion, remaining is 1, and the priority is 4-3=1. Wait, that's the opposite of Best Fit. Because the first bin would have a higher priority (2 vs 1), but the second bin leaves less space. So that's not right.

Ah, right. So perhaps the priority should be (remaining_capacity_after) but in a way that smaller values are better. So for each bin that can fit the item, compute (remaining_cap - item), which is the remaining space after insertion. Then, the priority is the negative of that. So higher priority (more negative) for smaller remaining space. Wait, no. Let's see: if remaining_cap is 5, item is 3, remaining after is 2. So (5-3) is 2. The negative would be -2. If another bin has remaining 4, item 3, remaining after is 1. (4-3)=1, negative is -1. So the second bin has a higher priority (-1 is higher than -2). So the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) * -1. So the bin with the smallest remaining after gets the highest priority. That's exactly Best Fit. So the priority function would be (bins_remain_cap >= item) * (bins_remain_cap - item) * -1. But then, bins that can't fit the item would have a priority of zero. Wait, but in code, we can mask out the bins that can't fit.

But the user's example code returns a priority array. So for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item, the priority is zero. Otherwise, compute the score.

So for Best Fit, the priority for each bin is (remaining_cap - item) if the bin can fit, else -infinity. Then, the bin with the maximum priority (smallest remaining space) is chosen.

But in code, how to represent that. Let's see. For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:

   priority[i] = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)  # because higher is better. So the smaller (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) is, the higher the priority.

else:

   priority[i] = -infinity (or a very low value)

But in numpy, we can compute the mask where bins_remain_cap >= item, then compute the priority as (bins_remain_cap - item) for those, and set others to a very low value.

Wait, but in the code, the function returns the priority array. So for bins that can't fit the item, their priority should be set to a very low value (like negative infinity) so they are not selected. Then, for bins that can fit, the priority is (remaining_cap - item) * -1, so that the smallest remaining cap after gets the highest priority.

Alternatively, the priority could be (1 / (remaining_cap_after + 1e-9)), which would make the bins with smaller remaining space have higher priority.

But perhaps the user wants a more creative approach than just Best Fit. Let's think of other heuristics.

Another heuristic is to consider the "exact fit". If a bin's remaining capacity is exactly equal to the item size, that's the best possible. So in that case, the priority should be highest. For other bins, maybe use Best Fit.

So the priority function could first check if any bin has remaining capacity exactly equal to the item. If yes, those bins get the highest priority. Otherwise, use Best Fit.

But how to encode that. For each bin, if remaining_cap == item, then priority is a very high value (like 1e9), else compute the Best Fit priority. That way, exact fits are prioritized.

Another idea: combine multiple heuristics. For example, the priority could be a weighted sum of two factors: the remaining capacity after insertion, and the reciprocal of the remaining capacity. Or perhaps, the priority is the sum of the remaining capacity after insertion (to minimize) and the square of the remaining capacity (to penalize larger leftovers). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the "fragmentation" of the remaining space. If placing the item in a bin leaves a remaining capacity that is a multiple of some common item size, that might be better. But since this is online, we don't know future items. So maybe that's not applicable.

Wait, but the problem is online, so the algorithm can't know future items. So the heuristic must be based on current information.

Another approach: prioritize bins that have the largest remaining capacity that is still larger than the item. Wait, that's Worst Fit. Worst Fit places the item in the bin with the largest remaining capacity that can hold the item. The idea is to leave larger spaces for future items. But Worst Fit generally performs worse than Best Fit in many cases.

But maybe combining Best Fit and Worst Fit in some way. For example, if the item is small, use Best Fit; if it's large, use Worst Fit. But how to determine the threshold.

Alternatively, use a dynamic approach where the priority is a function that balances between minimizing the current waste and leaving room for future items. For example, the priority could be (remaining_cap_after) * (remaining_cap_after < average_item_size), but again, without knowing future items, this is tricky.

Hmm. Let's think of a different angle. The priority function could be designed to prefer bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if the average item size is known, but in online scenarios, that's not available. So perhaps this isn't feasible.

Alternatively, use the harmonic mean or some other statistical measure. But again, without historical data, this is hard.

Wait, here's a creative idea inspired by the "Almost Exact Fit". For each bin, compute how close the remaining capacity is to the item size. The closer, the higher the priority. But also, give a bonus to bins where the remaining capacity after insertion is a multiple of a certain fraction. For example, if after inserting the item, the remaining capacity is 0.2, and if many items are around 0.2, that's good. But again, without knowing future items, this is not possible.

Alternatively, use a scoring function that combines the remaining capacity after insertion and the current bin's utilization. For example, the priority could be (item / (bin_remaining_cap)) if the bin can fit the item. This would prioritize bins where the item takes up a larger proportion of the remaining space. For example, if a bin has 5 units left and the item is 3, the ratio is 3/5=0.6. If another bin has 4 units left, the ratio is 3/4=0.75. So the second bin would have a higher priority. This is similar to Best Fit, but scaled by the item size. Wait, but this ratio is higher when the remaining capacity is smaller. So this would also prioritize bins where the item fills a larger portion of the remaining space, which is similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be (item + remaining_cap_after) / bin_size. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: consider the sum of the item size and the remaining capacity after insertion. Wait, that's just the original remaining capacity. Because remaining_cap_after = remaining_cap - item. So sum is remaining_cap. But that's not helpful.

Hmm. Let's think of a different strategy. Maybe the priority function should not only consider the current item but also the current state of the bins. For example, if there are bins that are almost full, it's better to fill them up first. So, for a bin that has a remaining capacity of 0.1 (assuming bin size is 1), and the item is 0.1, then placing it there is perfect. But if the item is 0.05, then placing it there leaves 0.05, which is better than creating a new bin. But how to model this.

Wait, perhaps the priority function can be designed to maximize the sum of the squares of the filled portions of the bins. This is inspired by the "resource allocation" problem where spreading resources evenly is better. But in bin packing, the goal is to minimize the number of bins. However, using the sum of squares might encourage more filled bins. For example, a bin that is 90% full is better than two bins that are 45% full each. So, the priority could be the square of (1 - remaining_cap_after / bin_size) if the bin can fit the item. But bin_size is fixed, say 1. So remaining_cap_after is (remaining_cap - item). So the filled portion is (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - remaining_cap + item. Wait, but the filled portion before adding the item is (1 - remaining_cap). After adding, it's (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - remaining_cap + item. So the filled portion increases by the item's size. The sum of squares would be higher if the filled portions are as large as possible. So placing the item in a bin that, after insertion, has a higher filled portion would contribute more to the sum. So the priority could be the filled portion after insertion. For example, if a bin has remaining_cap 0.2, and the item is 0.1, then after insertion, filled is 0.9. The square is 0.81. If another bin has remaining_cap 0.3 and the item is 0.1, filled is 0.8, square is 0.64. So the first bin would have higher priority. This encourages filling bins as much as possible, which aligns with Best Fit. But the priority here is the filled portion squared. So the priority function would be (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) ** 2 for bins that can fit the item. This is a variation of Best Fit but with a squared term to prioritize higher filled bins more aggressively.

Alternatively, use the filled portion without squaring. But the squared term would give higher weight to bins that are closer to being full.

Another idea: combine the Best Fit heuristic with a look-ahead for potential future items. For example, if the remaining capacity after insertion is a common item size, then it's better. But again, without knowing future items, this is not possible. So perhaps this is not applicable.

Wait, but maybe we can assume that future items are similar in size to the current one. For example, if the current item is of size 0.3, then future items might also be around 0.3. So placing the current item in a bin that leaves a remaining capacity of 0.3 would be good. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, the priority could be calculated as the remaining capacity after insertion divided by the item size. For example, if after insertion, the remaining capacity is 0.2 and the item is 0.3, then 0.2 / 0.3 ≈ 0.666. If another bin leaves 0.1, then 0.1/0.3 ≈ 0.333. Lower values are better, so the priority could be the negative of this ratio. But this would prioritize bins where the remaining capacity is a small fraction of the item size, which is similar to Best Fit.

But this approach might not work well if items vary in size. For example, if the next item is larger than the remaining capacity, then that space is wasted.

Hmm. Let's think of a different approach. The priority function could be designed to prefer bins where the remaining capacity after insertion is as small as possible, but also, if possible, to leave a remaining capacity that is a multiple of the current item's size. For example, if the item is 0.3, then a remaining capacity of 0.6 (which can fit two more 0.3 items) is better than 0.5. But this is speculative and requires knowing future items.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity after insertion, but with a bonus if that remaining capacity is a multiple of the item's size. For example, if remaining_cap_after is 0.3 and the item is 0.3, then that's a multiple (1x), so add a bonus. But again, this is speculative.

But since the problem is online, we can't know future items, so such heuristics may not be reliable.

Let's get back to the original task. The user wants a priority function that's better than the trivial one. The example given is priority_v1, which returns all zeros. The user wants priority_v2.

The key is to design a priority function that effectively selects the best bin for the current item to minimize the total number of bins used.

The Best Fit heuristic is known to perform well in many cases. So perhaps implementing a Best Fit-like priority function would be a good start. But maybe with some tweaks.

So, for each bin, if the bin can fit the item, the priority is (remaining_cap - item) * -1. This way, the bin with the smallest remaining capacity after insertion gets the highest priority. Bins that can't fit the item get a priority of zero (or a very low value). Wait, but in code, how to handle that.

Wait, in code:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) (i.e., the tightest fit) will have the highest priority (since it's the most negative multiplied by -1). Wait, no. Let's see: remaining_cap - item is the space left after insertion. For example, if a bin has 5 units left, and the item is 3, then remaining_cap - item is 2. So the priority is -2. Another bin with 4 units left and item 3 gives 1, priority -1. So the second bin has higher priority (-1 > -2). So this correctly implements Best Fit.

But in code, the priority would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    # Calculate remaining capacity after inserting the item
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    # Check which bins can fit the item
    can_fit = remaining_after >= 0
    # For bins that can fit, priority is the negative of remaining_after (so smaller remaining_after gives higher priority)
    # For bins that can't fit, set priority to -infinity
    priority = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after, -np.inf)
    return priority

This would work. But maybe we can add a tweak. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity after insertion is zero, give it the highest possible priority. Because that's a perfect fit. So in code, we can add a bonus for exact fits.

So:

remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
exact_fit = (remaining_after == 0)
priority = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after + 1e9 * exact_fit, -np.inf)

Wait, but how to handle that. For example, if a bin has remaining_after = 0, then the priority would be 0 (from -0) plus 1e9, making it 1e9. Other bins would have priority of -remaining_after. So exact fits get a very high priority, ensuring they are selected first.

This combines Best Fit with exact fit prioritization.

Another idea: give a higher priority to bins that are closer to being filled. For example, the priority could be (1 - (remaining_after / bin_size)) where bin_size is the total capacity. But since bin_size is fixed (e.g., 1), this is (1 - remaining_after). But this is the same as the filled portion after insertion. So the priority would be higher for bins that are more filled. But this is similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a combination of Best Fit and the filled portion. For example, priority = (1 - remaining_after) * 1000 - remaining_after. This would prioritize bins that are more filled, but within that, prefer those with smaller remaining_after. But this might not add much.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that prioritizes bins which, after inserting the item, have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value, like the average item size. But again, without knowing future items, this is not possible.

Another approach: consider the sum of the current filled space and the item. For example, a bin that is already 80% full and adding a 15% item would be 95% full, which is better than a bin that is 50% full and adding a 15% item (65%). So the priority could be the sum of the current filled space plus the item. But the current filled space is (bin_size - remaining_cap). So (bin_size - remaining_cap) + item = bin_size - remaining_cap + item = bin_size - (remaining_cap - item) = bin_size - remaining_after. So this is the same as (filled after insertion). So again, this is similar to Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems that many heuristics boil down to variations of Best Fit. So perhaps the best approach is to implement Best Fit but with a tweak for exact fits.

So, the code for priority_v2 would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    can_fit = remaining_after >= 0
    exact_fit = (remaining_after == 0)
    # For bins that can fit, priority is negative remaining_after, but exact fits get a huge boost
    priority = np.where(can_fit, -remaining_after + 1e9 * exact_fit, -np.inf)
    return priority

This way, exact fits are prioritized first. If there are multiple exact fits, they all have the same high priority. Otherwise, the Best Fit heuristic is used.

Alternatively, the exact fit could be given a higher priority than any possible Best Fit score. For example, if the maximum possible Best Fit priority is 0 (when remaining_after is 0), but wait, in the code above, for exact fits, remaining_after is 0, so -0 is 0, plus 1e9. So the priority is 1e9, which is higher than any other possible priority (since other priorities are negative numbers, like -1, -0.5, etc.). So this ensures that exact fits are chosen first.

Yes, this makes sense. So the code would first check for exact fits. If any bin can exactly fit the item, it will be selected. Otherwise, use Best Fit to choose the bin with the smallest remaining space after insertion.

This should be more efficient than standard Best Fit because it first checks for exact fits, which are optimal.

Another possible tweak: if there are no exact fits, then use Best Fit, but also consider the current utilization of the bin. For example, bins that are more filled might be prioritized even if the remaining_after is the same. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when there's no exact fit, the priority could be a combination of the remaining_after and the current filled space. For example, priority = (current filled + item) - remaining_after. But current filled is (bin_size - remaining_cap). So (bin_size - remaining_cap + item) - (remaining_cap - item) = bin_size - 2*remaining_cap + 2*item. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, the priority could be the filled space after insertion. So (bin_size - remaining_after) = bin_size - (remaining_cap - item) = (bin_size - remaining_cap) + item. Which is the current filled space plus the item. But this is the same as the filled space after insertion. So the priority would be higher for bins that are more filled after insertion, which is the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. So perhaps the code I wrote earlier is sufficient. Let's test it with an example.

Example 1:

item = 3

bins_remain_cap = [5, 4, 3, 2]

remaining_after = [2, 1, 0, -1]

can_fit = [True, True, True, False]

exact_fit = [False, False, True, False]

priority = [ -2 + 0, -1 + 0, 0 + 1e9, -inf ]

So the priorities are [ -2, -1, 1e9, -inf ]

The third bin (exact fit) has the highest priority and is selected.

Example 2:

item = 2

bins_remain_cap = [3, 2, 1]

remaining_after = [1, 0, -1]

can_fit = [True, True, False]

exact_fit = [False, True, False]

priority = [ -1, 1e9, -inf ]

The second bin is selected.

Example 3:

item = 2

bins_remain_cap = [4, 3, 2]

remaining_after = [2, 1, 0]

exact_fit = [False, False, True]

priority = [ -2, -1, 1e9 ]

Third bin is selected.

If there are no exact fits, then the priorities are based on Best Fit.

For example:

item = 2

bins_remain_cap = [3, 3, 3]

remaining_after = [1, 1, 1]

exact_fit = [False, False, False]

priority = [-1, -1, -1]

All have the same priority, so the first one is selected (assuming the code returns the same priority and the selection is based on first occurrence).

But in practice, the code would return the same priority for all three bins, and the algorithm would pick the first one (First Fit behavior in case of ties). But the priority function's job is to return the scores; the selection is done by choosing the highest score, and in case of ties, the first one.

So this code effectively combines exact fit checking with Best Fit. This should perform better than standard Best Fit in cases where exact fits are possible, which are optimal.

Therefore, the code for priority_v2 would be as follows.
</think>

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritize bins that exactly fit the item, then use inverse remaining capacity."""
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    can_fit = remaining_after >= 0
    exact_fit = (remaining_after == 0)
    
    # Give extreme priority to exact fits, then prioritize smallest remaining space
    priority = np.where(
        can_fit,
        -remaining_after + 1e9 * exact_fit,  # Exact fits get +1e9 boost
        -np.inf  # Infeasible bins get lowest priority
    )
    return priority
```
