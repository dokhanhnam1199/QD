Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online Bin Packing Problem. Let's think about what makes a good heuristic here. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. So, the priority function should determine which bin is best to place the current item into.

First, I remember common heuristics like First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit. Best Fit places the item into the bin that leaves the least remaining space after placement. That might be a good starting point. But maybe there's a way to improve upon that.

Wait, the priority function needs to assign a score to each bin. The highest score gets chosen. So for Best Fit, the priority would be the remaining capacity after inserting the item, but only if it's non-negative. But if the bin can't fit the item, the priority should be low or negative.

But perhaps we can combine multiple factors. For example, consider both the remaining space after placing the item and how well the bin's remaining capacity is utilized. Also, maybe we can prioritize bins that are almost full but still have space for the item. That way, we fill bins as much as possible.

Another idea: if a bin has exactly the item's size left, that's perfect. So maybe give a very high priority to bins where remaining capacity equals the item size. Then, for other bins, prioritize those where the remaining capacity after adding the item is as small as possible. But also, maybe we should prefer bins that have more remaining capacity first, but that's the opposite of Best Fit. Hmm.

Wait, Best Fit minimizes the leftover space. So the priority for each bin would be (remaining_capacity - item), but only if that's >=0. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_capacity - item) would be best. But how to translate that into a priority score. Since higher scores are better, maybe the priority is 1/(remaining_capacity - item + 1) if the item fits. That way, the smaller the leftover space, the higher the priority.

Alternatively, the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) but set to negative infinity if the bin can't fit. Then, the maximum of that would be the best fit. But in the function, we need to return a score for each bin.

Wait, the function should return a priority score array. So for each bin, if the bin can't fit the item (item > bin's remaining capacity), the priority is -infinity. Otherwise, the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item) but inverted so that smaller values are better. Wait, but higher scores are better. So for bins that can fit the item, the priority could be (1 / (remaining_cap - item + 1e-9)), which would make bins with exactly the right space have the highest priority. Because if remaining_cap - item is 0, then 1/0.000000001 is very large. Wait, but adding 1e-9 to avoid division by zero. So the priority is higher when the leftover space is smaller.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think of other factors. For example, the "exact fit" case is very good. So maybe give a very high score to bins where remaining capacity equals the item. Then, for others, use the Best Fit approach.

So the priority function could be:

For each bin in bins_remain_cap:

if item > bin_remain_cap: priority is -infinity

else:

   if bin_remain_cap == item: priority is 1e20 (a very high value)

   else: priority is (bin_remain_cap - item) but inverted. Wait, but how? Because we want to prioritize smaller (bin_remain_cap - item). So maybe the priority is 1/(bin_remain_cap - item + 1e-9). That way, smaller (bin_remain_cap - item) gives higher priority.

Alternatively, maybe use the negative of (bin_remain_cap - item), so that the largest negative (i.e., the smallest leftover) is the highest. But since we need to return a score where higher is better, the priority could be -(bin_remain_cap - item). But then, the maximum of that would be the smallest leftover.

Wait, let's see. Suppose bin A has remaining capacity 5, item is 3. Then leftover is 2. So -(5-3) = -2. Bin B has remaining 4, item 3. Leftover 1. -(4-3) = -1. So bin B's priority is higher (-1 > -2). So the maximum of the priorities would select bin B. So yes, using -(leftover) as the priority would work. But in that case, the priority is higher when the leftover is smaller.

But in code, we can compute the possible leftover as (bins_remain_cap - item). Then, for bins that can fit (item <= bins_remain_cap), the priority is -(leftover). For those that can't fit, set the priority to -infinity. Then, the bin with the highest priority (i.e., the smallest leftover) is selected.

But how to handle the exact fit. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity is exactly the item size, then leftover is zero. So the priority would be -0 = 0. But if another bin has leftover 1, priority is -1. Wait, no. Wait, if the priority is -(leftover), then a leftover of 0 gives a priority of 0, leftover 1 gives -1. So the exact fit has higher priority. So that's correct.

But in code, we can compute:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

priority = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But then, the maximum priority would be the bin with the smallest leftover. That's the Best Fit approach.

But maybe we can enhance this by giving a higher priority to exact fits. For example, if a bin's remaining capacity is exactly the item size, we can assign a very high priority (like 1e20) to ensure it's selected first. Then, for other bins that can fit, use the Best Fit approach.

So the priority function would be:

for each bin:

if bin can't fit item: priority is -inf

elif bin's remaining capacity == item: priority is 1e20

else: priority is -(remaining_cap - item)

This way, exact fits are prioritized first. Then, among others, the smallest leftover is chosen.

So in code:

mask_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item

exact_fit = (bins_remain_cap == item)

priority = np.where(exact_fit, 1e20, np.where(mask_fit, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf))

But in numpy, we can compute this with:

priority = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

valid_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item

priority[valid_mask] = -(bins_remain_cap[valid_mask] - item)

exact_mask = (bins_remain_cap == item) & valid_mask

priority[exact_mask] = 1e20

But perhaps a more concise way using np.where.

So putting it all together:

def priority_v2(...):

    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item

    exact = (bins_remain_cap == item)

    # For valid bins, compute base priority as -(remaining_cap - item)

    base_priority = -(bins_remain_cap - item)

    # Set invalid bins to -inf

    base_priority = np.where(valid, base_priority, -np.inf)

    # For exact matches, set to a very high value

    priority = np.where(exact, 1e20, base_priority)

    return priority

Wait, but the 'exact' mask is only valid if the bin can fit. So exact is (bins_remain_cap == item) and valid. So in code:

exact = (bins_remain_cap == item) & valid

But in the code above, the 'exact' is (bins_remain_cap == item), which may include bins that can't fit (if item is larger than bin's capacity, but that's impossible because valid is bins_remain_cap >= item. So if bins_remain_cap == item, then valid is True. So the code is okay.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):

    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item

    exact = (bins_remain_cap == item)

    base_priority = -(bins_remain_cap - item)

    base_priority = np.where(valid, base_priority, -np.inf)

    priority = np.where(exact, 1e20, base_priority)

    return priority

This way, exact fits get the highest priority, then the best fit (smallest leftover) among others.

But maybe there's another factor. For example, sometimes it's better to leave a bin with a small remaining capacity, which can be filled by future small items. So perhaps we can also consider the remaining capacity after placing the item, and give higher priority to bins that leave a remaining capacity that is as small as possible, but also, if possible, that remaining capacity is a size that is common in future items. But since this is online, we don't know future items. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the "Almost Worst Fit" or other heuristics. But the user asked for a priority function, so combining exact fit and best fit seems reasonable.

Another idea: prioritize bins that, after placing the item, have the smallest remaining capacity. But also, if a bin's remaining capacity after placement is very small (like 0.1), that's better than a bin that leaves 0.5. So the Best Fit approach.

But the code above does that. The exact fit is the best, then the next best is the one with the smallest leftover.

So this should be a good priority function. Let's test with an example.

Suppose bins_remain_cap = [5, 3, 2], item is 2.

Valid bins are all (5,3,2 >=2). Exact fits are bins where 5==2? No. 3==2? No. 2==2? Yes. So the third bin (index 2) has exact fit, priority 1e20. The other bins have base_priority: 5-2=3 → -3; 3-2=1 →-1; 2-2=0 → but exact fit is already handled. So the third bin is selected.

Another example: item is 3, bins_remain_cap [4, 3, 5]. Exact fit is bin 1 (3). So priority is 1e20. The other bins (4 and 5) have base_priority -(4-3)= -1 and -(5-3)=-2. So bin 1 is selected.

Another example: item is 3, bins_remain_cap [4, 2, 5]. No exact fits. So base_priority for bins 0 and 2: 4-3=1 → -1; 5-3=2 →-2. So bin 0 (remaining 4) is selected because -1 is higher than -2. So the item is placed in bin 0, leaving 1.

This is the Best Fit approach.

So this priority function combines exact fit and best fit. That should be better than the standard Best Fit because exact fits are prioritized first, which is optimal.

Therefore, the code for priority_v2 would be as above.
