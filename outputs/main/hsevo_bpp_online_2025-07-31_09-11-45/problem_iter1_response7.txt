Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. Let's think about how Richard Feynman might approach this. He was known for his creative problem-solving, so maybe applying some principles from physics or probability here.

First, the goal is to pack items into bins such that the number of bins is minimized. The priority function should decide which bin to place the next item into. The existing priority_v1 returns all zeros, which isn't helpful. So, what heuristics are effective for bin packing?

Common heuristics include First Fit (place in the first bin that fits), Best Fit (place in the bin that leaves the least space), and Worst Fit (opposite of Best). But maybe we can do better by combining different factors.

Wait, Feynman might consider the efficiency of the bin's remaining space. For example, if placing the item in a bin leaves a small remaining capacity, that's good because it fills the bin more. But also, maybe considering the probability that future items can fit into the remaining space. Like, if the remaining space after placing the item is a size that's more likely to be filled by future items, that's better.

Alternatively, think in terms of entropy or maximizing the utilization. Maybe a scoring system that combines the remaining space after placing the item and some measure of how useful that remaining space is. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining capacity is a common item size, that's better.

But how to quantify that? Since we don't know future items in online BPP, perhaps we can model the expected distribution of item sizes. For instance, if items are more likely to be small, then leaving a small remaining space is better. But without prior knowledge, maybe we can assume that smaller items are more common. So, a bin that after placement has a small remaining capacity is better.

Alternatively, use a function that gives higher priority to bins where the item fits exactly (perfect fit), then to those with the smallest remaining space. But also, maybe consider the ratio of the remaining space to the bin's total capacity. For example, a bin that's 90% full is better than one that's 50% full, but if adding the item would make it 95%, that's even better.

Wait, the Best Fit heuristic chooses the bin with the smallest remaining capacity after placing the item. So the priority could be the negative of (remaining capacity - item size), but only for bins where remaining capacity >= item. But maybe we can add some other factors.

Another idea: use a weighted score that combines how well the item fits now and how likely the remaining space can be filled later. For example, if the remaining space after placing the item is R, then the priority could be (1/(R + epsilon)) if R >=0, else -infinity. That would prioritize bins where the item fits and leaves the least space. But that's similar to Best Fit.

But maybe Feynman would think of a more nuanced approach. For example, considering the harmonic mean or some other mathematical function that captures the 'usefulness' of the remaining space. Or perhaps using a function that penalizes bins with remaining capacities that are not divisors of common item sizes. But without knowing the item distribution, that's tricky.

Alternatively, use a heuristic inspired by quantum states. For example, treating each possible remaining space as a state and assigning a probability amplitude based on some potential function. But that's abstract. Maybe a more practical approach.

Another angle: the priority could be a combination of the immediate fit and the potential to accommodate future items. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining space is R, then the priority is (current utilization) + (R * some weight). Wait, but higher R is worse. Hmm.

Wait, here's an idea inspired by the "Sum of Squares" heuristic. The sum of squares of the remaining capacities in each bin. Placing the item in a bin that reduces the sum of squares the most. But how to translate that into a priority function. The priority for a bin would be the negative of ( (remaining_cap - item)^2 - remaining_cap^2 ), which simplifies to 2*item*remaining_cap - itemÂ². But since we want higher priority for better fits, maybe the priority is (remaining_cap - item) if it's >=0, else -infinity. Wait, but that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) / remaining_cap, which would prioritize bins where the remaining space after placement is a smaller fraction of the original remaining space. For example, if a bin has 5 units left, and the item is 3, then (5-3)/5 = 0.4. If another bin has 4 units left and the item is 3, then (4-3)/4=0.25. So the first bin would have higher priority. Wait, but that's the opposite of Best Fit. Because in this case, the first bin leaves 2 units, the second leaves 1. But according to this calculation, the first has higher priority. That's not right. So maybe this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) but only for bins where remaining_cap >= item. Then, the highest priority is the smallest (remaining_cap - item), which is Best Fit. So the priority would be -(remaining_cap - item) for valid bins, so higher values (less remaining space) get higher priority.

But how to implement that. For example:

def priority_v2(...):
    # compute remaining after placing item
    after_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = after_remaining >=0
    # for valid bins, priority is -after_remaining (so higher when after_remaining is smaller)
    # for invalid, set to -infinity
    scores = np.where(valid, -after_remaining, -np.inf)
    return scores

That's the Best Fit heuristic. But maybe Feynman would add some twist. For example, considering the square of the remaining space to penalize larger leftovers more. So priority could be -(after_remaining)^2, which would prioritize bins where after_remaining is smallest. That's similar to Best Fit but more aggressive in reducing larger gaps.

Alternatively, use a combination of factors. For example, the priority could be (bins_remain_cap - item) / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9), which is the fraction of the bin's remaining capacity that the item would fill. So higher fractions are better. For example, if a bin has 5 capacity left and the item is 3, the fraction is 3/5=0.6. If another bin has 4 left and item is 3, 3/4=0.75. So the second bin would have higher priority. This is called the "Best Fit Decreasing" if items are sorted, but here it's online. This approach would prioritize putting the item into the bin where it uses the highest proportion of the remaining space. That's different from Best Fit. For example, a bin with 10 remaining and item 9 would have 0.9, which is higher than a bin with 2 remaining and item 1 (0.5). So this would prefer the first bin, even though the second leaves 1 unit (which is better). Hmm, but maybe this is a better heuristic in some cases.

Alternatively, combine both the absolute remaining and the relative. For example, a weighted sum: (remaining_cap - item) + alpha * (item / remaining_cap). But how to choose alpha.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that considers the inverse of the remaining space. So priority is 1/(after_remaining + epsilon) for valid bins. This way, smaller after_remaining gives higher priority. That's similar to Best Fit but using reciprocal.

But perhaps Feynman would think of a more creative approach. For example, using the concept of entropy. The entropy of the remaining space could be considered. Or maybe using a probabilistic model where the priority is the probability that the remaining space can be filled by future items. But without knowing the distribution, this is tricky.

Another angle: quantum superposition. Maybe each bin's priority is a combination of multiple factors, like a wavefunction. But how to translate that into code. Maybe using a product of different terms. For example, the product of (1 - after_remaining) and some other term. But not sure.

Alternatively, use a heuristic inspired by the harmonic series. For example, the priority is 1/(after_remaining) if after_remaining is a divisor of common item sizes. But again, without knowing the item distribution, this is not feasible.

Wait, here's a different idea. The "Almost Worst Fit" heuristic places the item in the bin that leaves the largest remaining space, but not the very worst. Maybe combining Best Fit with some other consideration. But how.

Alternatively, the priority could be the remaining capacity of the bin after placing the item, but only if it's possible. So for valid bins, the priority is (bin_remain_cap - item), and we select the smallest (so highest priority is the smallest value). Wait, but that's exactly Best Fit. So the code would be:

scores = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, bins_remain_cap - item, np.inf)
return -scores  # because lower scores (smaller remaining) are better.

But in code, the priority function returns a score where higher is better. So for bins that can fit the item, the priority is -(remaining_after), which is higher when remaining_after is smaller. For others, it's -infinity.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    after_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = after_remaining >= 0
    scores = np.where(valid, -after_remaining, -np.inf)
    return scores

But this is exactly the Best Fit heuristic. However, the user wants a more creative approach. So perhaps Feynman would think of a different heuristic.

Another approach: consider the sum of the current bin's remaining capacity and the item's size. For example, if a bin has R remaining, then after placing the item, the remaining is R - item. The priority could be R (original remaining) + (R - item). Wait, that's R + (R - item) = 2R - item. But why? Maybe this gives higher priority to bins that had more space and can still fit the item. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the product of the item size and the remaining capacity after placement. For example, item * (R - item). But that would be higher for larger items and larger remaining. Not sure.

Wait, here's a different idea inspired by the "First Fit" but with a twist. Maybe prioritize bins that have a remaining capacity close to the item size. For example, the priority is higher for bins where the remaining capacity is just enough to fit the item. But that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, use a scoring function that combines the remaining capacity after placement and the current utilization. For example, the score is (1 - (after_remaining / bin_capacity)) where bin_capacity is fixed. But since bins_remain_cap is the current remaining, the original bin capacity is not known. Wait, the problem states that bins are fixed-sized. So the original bin capacity is a fixed value, say 1 (assuming normalized sizes). If the bins are of size 1, then the remaining capacity after placing the item is (1 - sum of items in bin). So the original capacity is 1. Then, the utilization after placing the item would be (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - (remaining_cap - item) = 1 - remaining_cap + item. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If the bin's remaining capacity is R, then after placing the item of size s, the new remaining is R - s. The utilization is (original capacity - new remaining) / original capacity. If original capacity is C, then utilization is (C - (R - s)) / C = (C - R + s)/C. But since C is fixed, perhaps this isn't useful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the sum of the current utilization plus the item's size. For example, if a bin has R remaining, then the current utilization is (C - R)/C. Adding the item would add s/C to the utilization. So the new utilization is (C - R + s)/C. The priority could be this value. So higher utilization is better. So the priority is (C - R + s)/C. But since C is fixed, this is equivalent to (C - R + s), which is (C - R) is the used space before adding the item. So the priority is (used + s) / C. But since C is the same for all bins, this is equivalent to (used + s), which is the same as (C - R + s) = C - (R - s). But R - s is the new remaining. So higher priority is given to bins where (C - (R - s)) is higher, which is equivalent to (R - s) being smaller. So again, this is the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems that many heuristics boil down to Best Fit. But perhaps there's a more nuanced approach.

Wait, here's a paper that suggests using a heuristic called "Best Fit with Worst Case" or something similar. Alternatively, considering the sum of the squares of the used space in each bin. The goal is to minimize the sum of squares, which tends to keep bins as full as possible. The priority for placing an item in a bin is the increase in the sum of squares. The sum of squares after placing the item would be (used + s)^2. The increase is (used + s)^2 - used^2 = 2*used*s + sÂ². So the priority is 2*used*s + sÂ². But used is (original capacity - remaining_cap). So used = C - R. So the priority becomes 2*(C - R)*s + sÂ². Since C is fixed, this can be simplified. For example, if C is 1, then it's 2*(1 - R)*s + sÂ². The bin with the highest priority (highest increase in sum of squares) is chosen. This heuristic tends to favor placing items into bins that are already more full, which helps in consolidating items into fewer bins.

So the priority function would calculate for each bin the value 2*(C - R)*s + sÂ², where R is the bin's remaining capacity, s is the item size, and C is the bin's total capacity. But since the bins_remain_cap is given, and assuming the total capacity is known (say, 1), then:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    C = 1.0  # assuming bins are of size 1
    used = C - bins_remain_cap
    increase = 2 * used * item + item**2
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    scores = np.where(valid, increase, -np.inf)
    return scores

This would prioritize bins where adding the item increases the sum of squares the most. This heuristic is known to perform better than Best Fit in some scenarios.

But how do we handle varying bin capacities? The problem states that bins are fixed-sized, so C is a constant. So this approach is valid.

So this is a different heuristic from Best Fit. Let's test with an example. Suppose C=1.0.

Case 1: item=0.3, bins_remain_cap = [0.5, 0.7].

For each bin:

Bin 0: R=0.5, used=0.5. increase = 2*0.5*0.3 + 0.09 = 0.3 + 0.09 = 0.39.

Bin 1: R=0.7, used=0.3. increase = 2*0.3*0.3 +0.09= 0.18 +0.09=0.27.

So bin 0 has higher priority. So the item is placed in bin 0, which after placement has R=0.2. This is better than placing in bin 1 (R=0.4), as it leaves less space. So this heuristic works here.

Another example: item=0.4.

Bins_remain_cap = [0.5, 0.6].

Bin 0: used=0.5, increase=2*0.5*0.4 +0.16= 0.4 +0.16=0.56.

Bin 1: used=0.4, increase=2*0.4*0.4 +0.16=0.32 +0.16=0.48.

So bin 0 is chosen. After placing, R=0.1. Which is better.

But if the item is 0.6, and bins_remain_cap are [0.7, 0.6].

Bin 0: R=0.7, used=0.3. increase=2*0.3*0.6 +0.36=0.36 +0.36=0.72.

Bin 1: R=0.6, used=0.4. increase=2*0.4*0.6 +0.36=0.48 +0.36=0.84. So bin 1 is chosen. After placing, R=0.0. Which is perfect.

This seems to work well. So this heuristic, which is based on the sum of squares, could be a good candidate.

So the code would be:

import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    bin_capacity = 1.0  # Assuming bins are of size 1.0
    used_space = bin_capacity - bins_remain_cap
    # Calculate the increase in sum of squares if item is placed here
    sum_squares_increase = 2 * used_space * item + item**2
    # Only consider bins that can fit the item
    valid_mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # Set invalid bins to -infinity to ensure they're not chosen
    scores = np.where(valid_mask, sum_squares_increase, -np.inf)
    return scores

But wait, the bin capacity may not be 1.0. The problem statement says "fixed-sized bins" but doesn't specify the size. However, the function is given bins_remain_cap, which is the remaining capacity. So the total capacity of each bin is (original capacity) = bins_remain_cap + used_space. But since the problem is online, the bins are created as needed, each with the same fixed capacity. So the initial capacity is a constant, say C. But the code doesn't have access to C. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So for a new bin, the remaining capacity is C. So the code can't know C unless it's passed as a parameter. But the function signature doesn't include it. So this approach may not be feasible unless we assume C is 1.0.

But the problem statement doesn't specify the bin capacity. So this code assumes that the bin capacity is 1.0, which may not be correct. For example, if the bins are of size 10, then the code would be wrong.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because the code as written assumes that the bin capacity is 1.0, but in reality, the bins can have any fixed capacity. So the code needs to be adjusted.

Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity of each bin. So the original capacity of each bin is (remaining_cap + used_space). But since the bins are all of the same fixed size, the original capacity is the same for all bins. So the original capacity can be derived as (remaining_cap + used_space) for any bin. But since the used_space is not known, but the remaining_cap is given, perhaps the code can't determine the original capacity. Therefore, this approach is not feasible unless the bin capacity is known.

This is a problem. So the sum of squares approach requires knowing the original bin capacity. But the function doesn't have access to that. Therefore, this approach may not be possible.

So this is a flaw in the previous reasoning. How to proceed?

Alternative idea: instead of using the sum of squares of the used space, use the square of the remaining space after placing the item. The priority is to minimize the square of the remaining space. So the priority is -(remaining_cap - item)^2 for valid bins. This way, the smaller the remaining space after placement, the higher the priority. This is similar to Best Fit but squares the remaining space to prioritize reducing larger gaps more aggressively.

In code:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    after_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = after_remaining >= 0
    scores = np.where(valid, -after_remaining**2, -np.inf)
    return scores

This would prioritize bins where after_remaining is smallest, but squares it to give more weight to larger gaps. For example, a remaining of 0.1 would have a score of -0.01, while a remaining of 0.2 would be -0.04. The first is higher, so it's chosen. This is the same as Best Fit. Wait, no. Because Best Fit chooses the smallest after_remaining. Squaring it doesn't change the order. Because if a < b, then aÂ² < bÂ² (for a, b positive). So the negative of aÂ² would be -aÂ² > -bÂ². So the priority would be higher for smaller after_remaining. So this is the same as Best Fit. So this approach doesn't change the order.

Hmm. So perhaps the sum of squares approach is not feasible without knowing the original bin capacity. So back to the drawing board.

Another idea: use the item size divided by the remaining capacity. For valid bins, the priority is item / remaining_cap. This would prioritize placing the item into bins where the item takes up a larger proportion of the remaining space. For example, if a bin has 0.5 remaining and the item is 0.3, the ratio is 0.6. If another bin has 0.4 remaining and the item is 0.3, the ratio is 0.75. So the second bin is preferred. This is different from Best Fit. Best Fit would choose the second bin (after_remaining 0.1 vs 0.1 in this case). Wait, no. If the item is 0.3, and bins have remaining 0.5 and 0.4:

After placement, remaining is 0.2 and 0.1. Best Fit would choose the second bin. The ratio approach (item / remaining_cap) would be 0.3/0.5=0.6 and 0.3/0.4=0.75. So the second bin has higher priority. So in this case, both approaches choose the same bin. But in other cases, it might differ.

For example, item=0.4. Bins have remaining 0.5 and 0.6.

Ratio for first bin: 0.4/0.5=0.8. After placement, remaining 0.1.

Ratio for second bin: 0.4/0.6â0.666. After placement, remaining 0.2. So the ratio approach would choose the first bin, which is better. So this heuristic could be better than Best Fit.

Another example: item=0.5. Bins have remaining 0.6 and 0.7.

Ratio for first bin: 0.5/0.6â0.833. After placement, remaining 0.1.

Ratio for second bin: 0.5/0.7â0.714. So first bin is chosen, which is better.

But if the item is 0.2, and bins have remaining 0.3 and 0.5.

Ratio for first bin: 0.2/0.3â0.666. After placement, remaining 0.1.

Ratio for second bin: 0.2/0.5=0.4. So first bin is chosen. Which is better.

This seems promising. So the priority is item / remaining_cap for valid bins. This heuristic prefers to fill the remaining space as much as possible relative to the current remaining capacity. This is called the "Best Fit with Ratio" heuristic.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    epsilon = 1e-9  # to avoid division by zero
    valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
    ratio = np.divide(item, bins_remain_cap + epsilon)
    scores = np.where(valid, ratio, -np.inf)
    return scores

This way, bins that can fit the item are scored based on how much of their remaining capacity the item consumes. Higher ratios are better. This encourages placing the item into bins where it uses a larger proportion of the remaining space, potentially leaving smaller fragments.

This is different from Best Fit, which focuses on the absolute remaining space. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.5 and the item is 0.4, the ratio is 0.8, and after placement, the remaining is 0.1. Another bin with remaining 0.8 and item 0.4 would have a ratio of 0.5, and after placement, remaining 0.4. The first bin is better, and the ratio approach correctly selects it.

This heuristic might perform better in scenarios where items vary in size, as it adaptively chooses the bin where the item fills the highest proportion of the remaining space, thus reducing fragmentation.

So this is the approach I'll take. The code will compute the ratio of the item size to the bin's remaining capacity (adding a small epsilon to avoid division by zero) for valid bins, and assign -infinity to invalid bins. The highest ratio gets selected.
