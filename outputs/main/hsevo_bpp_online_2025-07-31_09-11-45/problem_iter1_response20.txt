<think>
Okay, I need to design a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The function takes an item size and the remaining capacities of the bins, and returns priority scores for each bin. The goal is to choose the best bin to pack the item, aiming to minimize the total number of bins used.

First, let me recall common heuristics for bin packing. The Best Fit heuristic places the item in the bin with the least remaining space that can still accommodate it. That's effective because it tries to fill bins as much as possible. But maybe there's a way to improve upon that.

Wait, the priority function needs to assign a score to each bin. For bins that can't fit the item, their priority should be low (like negative infinity) so they're not selected. For the others, the priority should be higher based on some criteria.

In the trivial example, they return all zeros. So for v2, I need to come up with a better scoring mechanism.

Let me think about possible factors. One idea is to prioritize bins where adding the item leaves the least remaining space. That's the Best Fit approach. So the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but only for bins that can fit. But maybe there's a twist here.

Alternatively, maybe combining multiple factors. For example, considering how full the bin would be after adding the item, but also how much the item fills the bin relative to its size. Or maybe considering the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity.

Another thought: bins that are almost full but not quite might benefit from being filled more. So if the remaining capacity after adding the item is small, that's good. So for each bin, calculate (remaining_cap - item). If that's >=0, then the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) but inverted, so that smaller values (less leftover space) get higher priority. Wait, because if remaining_cap - item is 0, that's perfect. So the priority could be 1/(remaining_cap - item + 1e-9) to make those bins with exactly enough space have the highest priority. But maybe that's what Best Fit does.

Alternatively, the priority could be (remaining_cap - item) but in a way that higher values (more space left) are worse. So for bins that can fit the item, the priority is (remaining_cap - item) but we want to minimize that. So the priority score could be -(remaining_cap - item), so higher scores (less leftover space) are better. That would be equivalent to Best Fit.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, considering the item's size relative to the bin's remaining capacity. If the item is large relative to the remaining space, maybe that's a good fit. For example, if the remaining capacity is 0.5 and the item is 0.5, that's perfect. But if the remaining capacity is 0.6 and the item is 0.5, then after placing, 0.1 is left. So the priority could be the item size divided by the remaining capacity. That ratio would be 1.0 when the item exactly fits, and higher ratios (like 0.5/0.6 = 0.833) would be better than lower ratios. Wait, no. If the item is 0.5 and the remaining capacity is 0.6, the ratio is 0.5/0.6 ≈ 0.83. If the remaining capacity is 0.5, the ratio is 1.0. So higher ratios are better. So the priority could be (item / (remaining_cap)) for bins where remaining_cap >= item. Then, the bin with the highest ratio (closest to 1) would be selected. This is known as the Best Fit Decreasing ratio, but in the online scenario, items are processed in order.

Wait, but in online BPP, items come one by one, and each must be placed immediately. So the heuristic has to work with the current state.

So for the priority function, for each bin that can fit the item, compute a score. The highest score gets chosen.

So for priority_v2, perhaps combining multiple factors. Let's think of possible factors:

1. Remaining capacity after placing the item (smaller is better).
2. The ratio of the item size to the bin's remaining capacity (higher is better).
3. The current remaining capacity of the bin (maybe bins that are already fuller are better to fill up first).

Another idea: For each bin, compute a score that is the sum of the remaining capacity after placing the item (so that smaller values are better) and maybe the inverse of the remaining capacity before placing the item. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be a weighted combination of (remaining_cap - item) and (item / remaining_cap). But how to combine them.

Alternatively, use a heuristic that prioritizes bins where the item fills as much as possible of the remaining space. So the priority is (item / remaining_cap) for bins that can fit the item. This would be the Best Fit with ratio approach.

Let me test this. Suppose bins have remaining capacities [0.5, 0.6, 0.3], and the item is 0.4.

For each bin:

- Bin 0: 0.5-0.4=0.1 left. Ratio is 0.4/0.5=0.8.
- Bin 1: 0.6-0.4=0.2 left. Ratio is 0.4/0.6≈0.666.
- Bin 2: 0.3 can't fit 0.4, so not considered.

So the ratio approach would select bin 0, which is correct as it leaves the least space. So this ratio approach is equivalent to Best Fit, because higher ratio implies that the item takes a larger portion of the remaining space, leading to less leftover.

Wait, the ratio (item / remaining_cap) is higher when the remaining_cap is smaller (as long as the item can fit). For example, if the remaining_cap is exactly equal to the item, the ratio is 1.0. If the remaining_cap is larger, the ratio is lower. So the ratio approach would prioritize bins where the item fills the bin as much as possible. So this is the same as Best Fit.

But in that case, the priority function would be:

For each bin, if the remaining capacity >= item, compute (item / remaining_cap), else -infinity. Then, the bin with the highest ratio is selected.

So the code would be:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(mask, item / bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
return priority

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think of other heuristics.

Another approach is Worst Fit, which places the item in the bin with the most remaining space that can fit it. That's the opposite of Best Fit. But in that case, the priority would be (remaining_cap - item), and select the highest. But Worst Fit generally performs worse than Best Fit in terms of bin count.

But the user is asking for a priority function, so perhaps combining Best Fit with other considerations.

Wait, maybe considering the square of the remaining capacity after placing the item. For example, (remaining_cap - item)^2. Then, the bin with the smallest value would be chosen. But that's similar to Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe the priority could be the remaining capacity after placing the item, but inverted. So 1/(remaining_cap - item + epsilon) to avoid division by zero. Then, higher values (smaller denominators) would be better. But this is similar to the ratio approach.

Alternatively, think of the remaining capacity after placing the item. The smaller it is, the better. So the priority could be -(remaining_cap - item), so higher values (closer to zero) are better.

But that's the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the standard, but maybe there's a variation that can perform better.

Another idea: Consider the sum of the current used space and the item. For example, a bin that is already 0.7 full, and adding a 0.3 item would fill it completely. That's ideal. So the priority could be (current_used + item) where current_used is (1 - remaining_cap). But that's the same as (1 - remaining_cap + item) = (1 - (remaining_cap - item)). So higher values are better. But this is equivalent to (remaining_cap - item) being as small as possible, which is Best Fit again.

Alternatively, maybe the priority is the sum of the item and the used space. For example, (1 - remaining_cap) + item. But that's not directly useful.

Wait, perhaps the priority could be the sum of the item and the used space, but only for bins that can fit. But that's (1 - remaining_cap + item) = 1 - (remaining_cap - item). So again, maximizing this is equivalent to minimizing (remaining_cap - item), which is Best Fit.

So perhaps the Best Fit approach is the standard, but maybe there's a way to tweak it.

Another angle: In some research, hybrid heuristics are used. For example, when the item is small, use Best Fit; when it's large, use a different strategy. But since the priority function can't know future items, perhaps we can adjust based on the item's size.

Wait, but the priority function is given the current item. So maybe the priority can take into account the item's size relative to the bin's remaining capacity. For example, if the item is large, prioritize bins where it fits exactly. If it's small, maybe spread them out.

But how to encode that into a priority function.

Alternatively, use a combination of the ratio and the remaining capacity after placement. For example, the priority could be (item / remaining_cap) + (1 - (remaining_cap - item)), but that's just combining two terms that are both higher for better fits.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum. But without knowing the problem's specifics, it's hard to set the weights.

Another idea: For each bin that can fit the item, compute a score that is the remaining capacity after placing the item, but also considering how much of the bin is already filled. For example, a bin that is 80% full and can take the item to reach 90% might be better than a bin that is 10% full and takes the item to 20%. So the priority could be (current filled + item) + (remaining_cap - item). Wait, that's (1 - remaining_cap + item) + (remaining_cap - item) = 1. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, the priority could be (current filled) + item. That is, the total filled after adding the item. Higher is better. Which is the same as (1 - remaining_cap + item) = 1 - (remaining_cap - item). So again, same as Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems like many approaches boil down to Best Fit. So perhaps the priority_v2 is implementing Best Fit, but with a twist.

Wait, the original problem says that the priority function returns a score for each bin, and the highest score is selected. So for Best Fit, the priority would be (remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit, and -infinity otherwise. Then, the bin with the smallest (remaining_cap - item) would have the highest priority. But since we need to return a score where higher is better, the priority should be -(remaining_cap - item). So the code would be:

mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)
return priority

But this is equivalent to Best Fit. Alternatively, using the ratio approach.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose two bins: bin A has remaining capacity 0.5, bin B has 0.6. The item is 0.4.

For Best Fit, bin A is chosen because 0.5-0.4=0.1, which is smaller than 0.6-0.4=0.2.

In the ratio approach, bin A's ratio is 0.4/0.5=0.8, bin B's is 0.4/0.6≈0.666. So bin A is chosen. Same result.

So both approaches would select the same bin. So the ratio approach and the Best Fit approach are equivalent in this case.

But what if the item is 0.3. Bin A has remaining 0.4, bin B has 0.5.

Ratio for A: 0.3/0.4=0.75. For B: 0.3/0.5=0.6. So A is chosen. Best Fit would also choose A, since 0.4-0.3=0.1, which is smaller than 0.5-0.3=0.2.

So in these cases, the ratio approach and Best Fit are the same.

But what if the item is 0.2. Bin A has 0.3, bin B has 0.4.

Ratio for A: 0.2/0.3≈0.666. For B: 0.2/0.4=0.5. So A is chosen. Best Fit would also choose A (0.3-0.2=0.1 vs 0.4-0.2=0.2). So same result.

So the ratio approach and Best Fit are equivalent. Therefore, using the ratio as the priority score is the same as Best Fit.

But perhaps there's a different approach. For example, considering the square of the remaining capacity after placing the item. So the priority is -( (remaining_cap - item) )^2. This would penalize larger leftover spaces more. But in practice, this would still select the same bin as Best Fit.

Alternatively, maybe the priority is the remaining capacity after placing the item divided by the bin's original capacity. But if all bins are the same size, this is the same as the remaining capacity.

Alternatively, consider the sum of the item's size and the used space in the bin. For example, (1 - remaining_cap) + item. But this is 1 - remaining_cap + item = 1 - (remaining_cap - item). So higher values are better, which again is the same as Best Fit.

Hmm. It seems like many variations lead back to Best Fit. So perhaps the priority_v2 is implementing Best Fit, but the user wants a different approach.

Wait, maybe the user wants a heuristic that's better than Best Fit. But according to literature, Best Fit is one of the best heuristics for online bin packing. So perhaps the answer is to implement Best Fit.

But the initial code (priority_v1) returns all zeros, which is not useful. So the user wants a better version.

So for priority_v2, the code would implement Best Fit. Let's code that.

But how to handle bins that can't fit the item. For those, assign a very low priority (like -infinity) so they are not selected.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # For bins that can fit, compute (remaining_cap - item), then invert to get higher priority for smaller values
    # So priority is -(remaining_cap - item)
    # But to handle cases where remaining_cap == item, which is perfect fit
    priorities = np.where(mask, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)
    return priorities

But wait, this would assign higher priority to bins where (remaining_cap - item) is smaller, which is exactly Best Fit.

Alternatively, using the ratio approach:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    mask = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # Compute the ratio of item to remaining capacity
    ratio = item / bins_remain_cap
    # For bins that can't fit, set to -inf
    priorities = np.where(mask, ratio, -np.inf)
    return priorities

This would also implement Best Fit, as higher ratio implies better fit.

But which one is better? According to some sources, Best Fit and Best Fit with ratio are the same in terms of selection. Because the ratio is higher when the remaining capacity is smaller (given the same item size). So both approaches would select the same bin.

But perhaps there's a different heuristic. For example, the "Almost Worst Fit" or other variations.

Alternatively, consider a combination of Best Fit and the current bin's filled space. For example, prioritize bins that are almost full but can still fit the item. For example, if a bin has 0.9 remaining capacity and the item is 0.1, then after placing, 0.8 remains. But if another bin has 0.2 remaining and the item is 0.1, then after placing, 0.1 remains. The latter is better. So Best Fit would choose the latter.

But perhaps there's a heuristic that also considers the current filled space. For example, a bin that is more filled (i.e., has less remaining capacity) is preferred even if the leftover after placing the item is the same. For example, if two bins have remaining capacities 0.3 and 0.4, and the item is 0.2. Both would have 0.1 and 0.2 leftover. Best Fit would choose the first. But maybe the second bin is more filled (0.6 used vs 0.7 used). Wait, no. The first bin's remaining capacity is 0.3, so used is 0.7. The second's remaining is 0.4, used is 0.6. So the first bin is more filled. So Best Fit already prefers the more filled bin.

So perhaps the Best Fit approach is sufficient.

But the user wants a creative priority function. Maybe combining multiple factors. For example, the priority could be a combination of the ratio and the remaining capacity after placement.

Alternatively, use a weighted sum of the ratio and the inverse of the remaining capacity after placement. For example:

priority = (item / remaining_cap) + (1 / (remaining_cap - item + 1e-9))

But this would give higher priority to bins where the item fills a large ratio of the remaining space and leaves very little. But this might be redundant.

Alternatively, use a product of the two terms. For example:

priority = (item / remaining_cap) * (1 / (remaining_cap - item + 1e-9))

But this would heavily prioritize bins where the item takes up a large ratio and leaves very little space. However, this could lead to numerical instability when (remaining_cap - item) is very small.

Alternatively, use the sum of the ratio and the inverse of the leftover space. But this might not be necessary.

Another idea: For each bin that can fit the item, compute a score that is the sum of the item's size and the used space in the bin. So (used + item) = (1 - remaining_cap + item). This is the same as (1 - (remaining_cap - item)), which is maximized when (remaining_cap - item) is minimized. So again, same as Best Fit.

Hmm. It's challenging to think of a different heuristic that's better than Best Fit. But perhaps there's a variation that works better in certain scenarios.

Wait, another heuristic is the "First Fit" which places the item in the first bin that can fit. But that's not a priority-based approach. The priority for First Fit would be 1 for the first bin that can fit, and 0 or lower for others. But that's not applicable here since the priority function must return a score for each bin.

Alternatively, the "Worst Fit" which places the item in the bin with the most remaining space. The priority would be (remaining_cap - item) for bins that can fit, and the highest value is selected. But this is known to perform worse than Best Fit.

So perhaps the priority_v2 should implement Best Fit via the ratio approach.

Alternatively, another approach is to prioritize bins that, after placing the item, have a remaining capacity that is a multiple of a certain value, which could help in future packing. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining capacity is a small value that's likely to be filled by future items. But this requires knowing the distribution of item sizes, which is not available in the online scenario.

Alternatively, use a harmonic approach, where items are categorized into size classes, and bins are managed to have items of similar sizes. But this is more complex and requires maintaining state, which the priority function doesn't have access to.

Given that the priority function can't maintain state between items (since each item is processed independently), the function must rely solely on the current item and the current bin capacities.

So, given all that, perhaps the best approach is to implement Best Fit via the ratio method.

So the code would be:

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    # Calculate which bins can fit the item
    can_fit = bins_remain_cap >= item
    # For bins that can fit, compute the ratio of item size to remaining capacity
    ratio = np.divide(item, bins_remain_cap, where=can_fit)
    # Set priority to ratio for bins that can fit, else -infinity
    priorities = np.where(can_fit, ratio, -np.inf)
    return priorities

This way, the bin with the highest ratio (closest to 1) is selected, which is the Best Fit approach.

Alternatively, another variation could be to prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is a multiple of a certain value. For example, if after placing the item, the remaining capacity is 0.1, which is a common item size. But without knowing future items, this is speculative.

But given the constraints, the ratio approach is solid.

Another idea: Adjust the priority to favor bins that are closer to being filled. For example, if a bin has a remaining capacity of 0.5 and the item is 0.5, that's perfect. So the priority could be (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) which is 1 when it's a perfect fit. But this is the same as (1 - (remaining_cap - item)) = 1 - remaining_cap + item = (item + (1 - remaining_cap)), which is the sum of the item and the used space. But this is the same as the Best Fit approach.

Alternatively, use the square of the ratio. For example, (item / remaining_cap)^2. This would give higher priority to bins where the item fills a larger portion of the remaining space. But this doesn't change the order of priorities, just scales them.

So, after considering various options, the Best Fit approach using the ratio seems appropriate. Therefore, the code for priority_v2 would implement this.
