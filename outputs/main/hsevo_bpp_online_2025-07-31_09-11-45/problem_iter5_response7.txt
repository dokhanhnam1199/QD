Okay, I need to create an improved priority_v2 function by combining elements from the better code (priority_v0) and the worse code (priority_v1), based on the analysis provided. Let me first recall what each version does.

The better code (v0) uses a geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. Fill efficiency is item divided by bin's remaining capacity (plus a small epsilon to avoid division by zero). Residual potential is the square root of the remaining capacity after placing the item. It also adds a bonus for exact fits. The synergy score is the sqrt of the product of fill efficiency and residual potential, which is a geometric mean. The constants like eps_fill and eps_residual are carefully calibrated.

The worse code (v1) uses harmonic efficiency (1 over remaining_after) multiplied by the square root of the original bin capacity. It boosts exact fits to infinity. However, the analysis mentioned that overcomplicating with terms like quantum-inspired or hyperbolic transforms can introduce noise. The v1 uses harmonic (which is 1/gap) and residual as sqrt(original capacity), which might not be as effective.

The analysis points out that the best heuristics balance simplicity with precision-tuned components. So, combining the strengths of v0 and v1 while avoiding their weaknesses.

Looking at the analysis: v0's key points are geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, calibrated constants, and a perfection bonus. v1's approach includes exact fit detection and harmonic efficiency, but the residual is based on original capacity, which might not be as good as v0's residual after placement.

So, to improve, perhaps take the geometric mean approach from v0, keep the exact fit bonus, and ensure that the residual potential is based on the remaining space after placing the item (like v0's sqrt(remaining_after)), not the original bin capacity. Also, use the calibrated constants from v0 for numerical stability.

Wait, in v1, the residual is sqrt of the original bin capacity, which might not be as relevant as the remaining space after placing the item. v0's residual_potential is sqrt(remaining_after), which makes more sense because it's about the leftover space. So that's better.

So, the improved function should:

1. Calculate remaining_after as bins_remain_cap - item.
2. Check for valid_mask (remaining_after >=0).
3. Detect exact fits with a tolerance (like both versions do).
4. Compute fill efficiency as item/(bins_remain_cap + eps), similar to v0.
5. Compute residual potential as sqrt(remaining_after + eps), like v0.
6. Combine them using geometric mean (sqrt(fill * residual)), as in v0.
7. Add a perfection bonus for exact fits, as in v0.
8. Use calibrated constants for epsilons and bonuses.

The v1's harmonic approach (1/gap) might not be as effective as the fill efficiency in v0, so probably stick with v0's approach. However, maybe the harmonic term could be incorporated, but the analysis says that overcomplicating is bad. So better to stick with the v0's method.

So, the improved v2 would take the core of v0 but perhaps adjust some elements. Wait, the user says to combine elements from both. So maybe take the exact fit detection from v1 (using np.isclose) and the perfection bonus from v0. But v0 already does that. Wait, in v0, the exact fit is handled via the perfection_bonus, which is a weight added when remaining_after is close to zero. So perhaps that's already covered.

Alternatively, in v1, exact fits are given np.inf, which ensures they are chosen first. In v0, the perfection_bonus adds a weight, but maybe not infinity. However, the analysis says that the better code uses a focused approach with calibrated constants. So perhaps the v0's method of adding a bonus is better than setting to infinity, as it avoids hard thresholds.

So, combining the best of both: use the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, add a perfection bonus, and use calibrated epsilons. Also, ensure that invalid bins are marked with -inf.

Another point from the analysis: the worse code (v1) uses harmonic * residual, which is a product (geometric mean via multiplication). But the better code (v0) uses sqrt(fill * residual), which is the actual geometric mean. So v0's approach is better.

So, the improved function would be similar to v0 but perhaps with some tweaks. Wait, the user wants to combine elements from both. Maybe take the exact fit detection from v1 (setting those bins to have higher priority) and the residual potential from v0. But in v0, the exact fit is handled via the perfection_bonus. So perhaps the combination is already in v0, but maybe adjust the perfection_bonus to be a higher weight, or use a different way to prioritize exact fits.

Alternatively, in v0, the exact fit gives a bonus, but in v1, it's set to infinity. Maybe in v2, when an exact fit is detected, set the score to a very high value (like np.inf) to ensure it's chosen first. That way, exact fits are prioritized above all else, which is a good strategy.

So, the plan for v2:

1. Compute remaining_after and valid_mask as before.
2. Check for exact fits (using np.isclose) and set their scores to infinity.
3. For non-exact fits, compute fill efficiency and residual potential as in v0.
4. Combine them using geometric mean (sqrt(fill * residual)).
5. Add any other bonuses if needed.
6. Set invalid bins to -inf.

Wait, but in v0, the exact fit is part of the perfection_bonus, which is added to the synergy score. But if we instead set exact fits to infinity, that might be better. Because in v0, even if a bin is an exact fit, its score is synergy_score + perfection_bonus. But if another bin has a higher synergy score, it might not be chosen. However, in v1, exact fits are set to infinity, ensuring they are selected first.

So combining that: first check for exact fits, set their priority to infinity, then for other valid bins, compute the synergy score. This way, exact fits are prioritized first, which is optimal.

So, the steps would be:

- Calculate remaining_after.
- valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
- exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol)
- For bins where exact_fit is True, set their score to infinity.
- For other valid bins, compute fill efficiency and residual potential, then synergy score.
- Invalid bins get -inf.

This way, exact fits are chosen first, then the next best option based on the synergy score.

But in v0, the exact fit is given a bonus, but not infinity. The analysis says that the better code uses a focused approach. However, in the analysis, the worse code (v1) boosts exact fits to maximum priority (inf), which might be a good idea. But why is v0 better than v1 then? Because v0's other components are better. So perhaps combining the exact fit boost from v1 with the better synergy score from v0.

So, in v2, the code would:

- Check for exact fits and set their score to infinity.
- For non-exact valid bins, compute the synergy score as in v0.
- This ensures that exact fits are prioritized first, which is optimal, and then the next best options are chosen based on the synergy of fill efficiency and residual potential.

But wait, in the analysis, the better code (v0) uses the perfection_bonus, which adds a weight to the synergy score for exact fits. But in the worse code (v1), exact fits are set to infinity. The analysis says that the better code avoids unnecessary complexity. So perhaps the v0's approach of adding a bonus is better than setting to infinity, but the analysis says that the worse code (v1) has "Boost exact fits to maximum priority" which might be a good idea but is part of a worse overall heuristic.

Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. The analysis mentions that the best heuristics balance simplicity with precision-tuned components. So, perhaps in v2, we should prioritize exact fits by setting their score to infinity, as that's a simple and effective rule. Then, for other bins, use the synergy score from v0.

But why was v0 better than v1? Because v1's other components (harmonic and residual based on original capacity) are worse. So combining the exact fit boost from v1 with the better synergy calculation from v0 could yield a better heuristic.

So, the code for v2 would:

1. Compute remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
2. valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
3. exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=some_tolerance)
4. For exact fits, set score to infinity
5. For other valid bins, compute fill_efficiency (item/(bin_cap + eps)) and residual_potential (sqrt(remaining_after + eps)), then synergy_score as sqrt(fill * residual)
6. Set scores for non-exact valid bins to synergy_score
7. Invalid bins get -inf

This way, exact fits are chosen first, and others are ranked by the synergy of fill and residual.

But in v0, the exact fit is not set to infinity but given a bonus. However, the analysis says that the better code uses a focused approach. So perhaps the v0's method of adding a bonus is better because it allows for a more nuanced priority where an exact fit is preferred but not at the cost of other factors. Wait, no. If a bin is an exact fit, it's optimal to place the item there because it perfectly fills the bin, leaving no wasted space. Therefore, in such cases, that bin should be selected regardless of other factors. Hence, setting the score to infinity for exact fits ensures they are chosen first, which is correct.

So, in v2, we should first check for exact fits and prioritize them, then use the synergy score from v0 for other bins.

Now, let's think about the parameters. The v0 has several calibrated constants: eps_fill, eps_residual, atol_perfection, perfection_bonus_weight. The v1 uses a simple atol=1e-9 for exact fit and eps=1e-9 in harmonic.

In v2, we can adopt the exact fit detection with a tolerance (like v0's atol_perfection) and set those bins to infinity. Then, for the other bins, use the synergy score from v0 without the perfection_bonus, since exact fits are already handled.

Wait, but in v0, the perfection_bonus is added to the synergy score. If we handle exact fits separately, then the perfection_bonus is not needed. So in v2, the code would:

- For each bin:
   - if exact fit, score = inf
   - else if valid, compute synergy_score (fill * residual)^0.5
   - else, score = -inf

This way, exact fits are top priority, then the synergy score.

But in v0, the perfection_bonus is added as a weight. Maybe that's redundant if we already handle exact fits with a separate check. So combining the two approaches: check for exact fits first, give them infinity, then for others, use the synergy score from v0 (without the bonus). This would combine the exact fit handling from v1 with the synergy calculation from v0.

Alternatively, maybe the perfection_bonus in v0 is for near-exact fits, but the analysis says that the better code uses rigorous floating-point handling. So perhaps in v2, we can have both: exact fits (with tight tolerance) get infinity, and near-exact fits get a bonus. But that might complicate things. The analysis warns against overengineering.

So, to keep it simple and effective, the improved v2 would:

- Prioritize exact fits (with a tight tolerance) by setting their score to infinity.
- For other valid bins, compute the synergy score as in v0 (geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential).
- Use the calibrated epsilons from v0 for numerical stability.

This combines the exact fit prioritization from v1 with the better synergy calculation from v0.

Now, let's structure the code.

The function will:

1. Calculate remaining_after.
2. Determine valid_mask (remaining_after >=0).
3. Determine exact_fit using np.isclose with a tolerance.
4. Set scores for exact_fit to infinity.
5. For other valid bins, compute fill_efficiency and residual_potential, then synergy_score as sqrt(fill * residual).
6. Set scores for non-exact valid bins to synergy_score.
7. Set invalid bins to -inf.

But wait, in v0, the fill_efficiency is item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill). Why bins_remain_cap and not the remaining_after? Because fill efficiency is how much of the bin's current remaining capacity is filled by the item. For example, if a bin has 5 capacity left, and the item is 3, then fill efficiency is 3/5 = 0.6. This makes sense because it represents how tightly the item fits into the remaining space.

The residual_potential is sqrt(remaining_after + eps_residual), which is the space left after placing the item. This encourages leaving space that can be more easily filled by future items (since sqrt penalizes very small residuals less).

So, the synergy score balances filling the bin as much as possible (high fill_efficiency) with leaving a manageable amount of space (high residual_potential).

By prioritizing exact fits first, then using this synergy score, the heuristic should perform well.

Now, code:

Import numpy as np.

Define the function with parameters similar to v0, but include the exact fit handling from v1.

Wait, in v0, the exact fit is part of the perfection_bonus added to the score. But in the new approach, we handle exact fits separately. So the code would look like:

def priority_v2(...):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol_perfection)
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill)
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + eps_residual)
    synergy_score = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)
    scores = np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score, -np.inf))
    return scores

But wait, in this case, the exact_fit is a boolean array. For bins where exact_fit is True, their score is set to infinity. Otherwise, if valid, use synergy_score, else -inf.

This combines the exact fit detection from v1 (but with the same tolerance as v0's atol_perfection) and the synergy score from v0. The perfection_bonus from v0 is no longer needed because exact fits are handled separately.

But in v0, the perfection_bonus is added to the synergy_score for exact fits. However, in this new approach, exact fits are given infinity, which overrides any other score. This might be better because it ensures that exact fits are always chosen first, which is optimal.

So, the parameters would include atol_perfection, eps_fill, eps_residual from v0.

The docstring should explain the key idea: Prioritizes exact fits, then balances fill efficiency and residual space via geometric mean.

Testing this approach: exact fits are top priority, then the synergy of fill and residual. This should combine the strengths of both versions.

Now, code:

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritizes exact fits, then balances fill efficiency and residual 
    potential using geometric mean with calibrated stability constants."""
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    # Precision parameters from v0's calibration
    eps_fill = 3.9947e-07
    eps_residual = 2.3511e-07
    atol_perfection = 5.4225e-06
    
    # Detect exact fits with tight tolerance
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol_perfection)
    
    # Calculate synergy score for non-exact valid bins
    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill)
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + eps_residual)
    synergy_score = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)  # Geometric mean
    
    # Assign scores: exact fits get infinity, others use synergy or -inf
    scores = np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, 
                      np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score, -np.inf))
    
    return scores
```

This code first checks for exact fits with a tight tolerance, assigning them infinity. For other valid bins, it calculates the synergy score as the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, using the calibrated constants from v0. Invalid bins get -inf. This combines the exact fit prioritization from v1 with the better synergy calculation from v0, avoiding overengineering while maintaining numerical stability.
