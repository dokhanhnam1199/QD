Okay, I need to create an improved priority function for the online bin packing problem by combining elements from the provided v0 and v1 versions, while incorporating the insights from the analysis. Let me start by understanding what each version does.

The v0 function uses a gravitational analogy. It prioritizes exact fits first (giving them infinite priority), then uses the inverse square of the remaining space for other bins. This ensures tight packing. The v1 function is inspired by black holes, using curvature (inverse remaining space plus bin capacity over item size) and applies a radiation penalty to near-empty bins. However, the analysis mentions that v1's penalties can disrupt ordering and over-penalize mid-range bins.

From the analysis, effective heuristics balance tight packing with future flexibility, handle floating points properly, use smooth gradients, and avoid over-penalizing. The better approach combines elements like harmonic efficiency and residual potential. The worse ones use multiplicative terms that can create cliffs or over-penalize.

So, combining v0's exact fit handling and inverse square with v1's consideration of bin utilization (density) but without the problematic penalties. The analysis also mentions that the best heuristics use geometric mean for balanced trade-offs. 

Wait, the analysis of the 2nd vs 19th says that using golden ratio weighting between tight fits and flexibility is good. Also, the 13th handles floating points with np.isclose. The v0 uses exact_fit with ==0, which might not be safe for floats. So maybe replace that with a tolerance check.

So, the plan is:

1. Check for exact fits using a tolerance (like np.isclose) instead of ==0 to handle floating points.
2. For non-exact fits, combine both the remaining space (inverse square for tightness) and the bin's current utilization (to favor bins that are more filled, promoting consolidation).
3. Avoid multiplicative penalties that can create over-penalization. Instead, use a balanced combination, maybe geometric mean or additive terms with weights.
4. Ensure smooth gradients without abrupt changes except for exact fits and invalid bins.

Let me structure this. The priority for a bin could be a combination of how tightly the item fits (remaining space) and how full the bin is. For example, if a bin has more existing items, packing another item there might be better. But since we only have remaining capacity, the utilization can be calculated as (original capacity - remaining capacity)/original capacity. But original capacity isn't provided. Wait, the bins_remain_cap is the remaining capacity. So original capacity is bins_remain_cap + sum of items already in the bin. But we don't have that info. Hmm, maybe the original bin size is fixed. Wait, in standard BPP, all bins have the same fixed capacity. So if the original capacity is a fixed value (like 1.0), then the utilization is (original_cap - bins_remain_cap[i])/original_cap. But the function doesn't receive the original capacity. Oh, right, the function only gets bins_remain_cap, which is the remaining capacity. So unless the original capacity is known, we can't compute utilization. Wait, but in the problem statement, the bins are fixed size. So the original capacity is a constant. But the function doesn't have access to that. Hmm, this is a problem. Because the function only receives the remaining capacities, not the original. So unless the original capacity is a known parameter, we can't compute utilization. But the function's parameters don't include it. So maybe the original capacity is 1.0 (assuming normalized items), but that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the code can't use the original capacity. Wait, looking at the existing code:

In v1, they compute density as (bins_remain_cap - remaining_space + item)/bins_remain_cap. Wait, remaining_space is bins_remain_cap - item. So bins_remain_cap - remaining_space + item = bins_remain_cap - (bins_remain_cap - item) + item = bins_remain_cap - bins_remain_cap + item + item = 2*item. That seems incorrect. Maybe that's a mistake in the v1 code. Because density would be (used space + item)/original capacity. But if original capacity is not known, perhaps the code is flawed. So perhaps the v1 code's density calculation is wrong. 

Given that, maybe the original capacity is not available, so we can't compute utilization. Therefore, the heuristic can't rely on that. So perhaps the better approach is to focus on remaining space and exact fits. 

Wait, the analysis mentions that the best heuristics combine harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt(capacity)) via geometric mean. But without knowing the original capacity, how can we compute residual potential? Unless residual potential refers to the remaining capacity. Hmm. Maybe the residual potential is the remaining capacity after placing the item. So, for a bin, after placing the item, the remaining space is bins_remain_cap - item. The residual potential could be the remaining space, but we want to minimize that. So, the harmonic term is 1/(remaining_space) and the residual potential is sqrt(remaining_space), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the residual potential is the remaining capacity of the bin before placing the item. So, bins_remain_cap. But how does that factor in?

Alternatively, the analysis says that combining harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) with residual potential (sqrt(capacity)) via geometric mean. Wait, maybe the original capacity is considered as a fixed value, say 'C'. Then residual potential could be sqrt(C - (C - bins_remain_cap)), which is sqrt(bins_remain_cap + item - remaining_space?), not sure. This is getting confusing. Maybe the key idea is to balance between the tightness of the fit (remaining space after placing the item) and the current utilization of the bin (how full it is before placing the item). But without knowing the original capacity, utilization can't be calculated. 

Wait, perhaps the original capacity is the same for all bins and is known. For example, if all bins have capacity 1.0, then the remaining capacity is 1.0 - sum of items in the bin. So, the utilization is 1.0 - bins_remain_cap. But the function doesn't have the original capacity as a parameter. So this is a problem. Therefore, the function can't use the original capacity unless it's a global constant. But in the given code examples, the functions don't have access to that. So perhaps the problem assumes that the original capacity is 1.0, and items are normalized. But that's an assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe the code can't use the original capacity, so the heuristic has to work with the remaining capacity. So, for a bin, the remaining capacity after placing the item is bins_remain_cap[i] - item. We want this to be as small as possible (to pack tightly). Also, bins that are already more filled (lower remaining capacity before placing the item) might be preferred to fill them up. 

So, for a bin, the priority could be a combination of:

1. The inverse of the remaining space after placing the item (to prioritize tight fits).
2. The inverse of the remaining capacity before placing the item (to prioritize bins that are already more full).

But how to combine these two factors. The analysis mentions using geometric mean for balanced trade-offs. So, for each bin, compute a score that is the geometric mean of (1 / remaining_space_after) and (1 / remaining_capacity_before). 

Wait, but remaining_capacity_before is bins_remain_cap[i], and remaining_space_after is bins_remain_cap[i] - item. 

So, the score could be sqrt( (1/(remaining_space_after + eps)) * (1/(bins_remain_cap[i] + eps)) ), where eps is a small value to prevent division by zero. 

Alternatively, the harmonic mean or some other combination. 

But the analysis also mentions that the best heuristics use harmonic efficiency (1/remaining) and residual potential (sqrt(capacity)), which might refer to the original capacity. But without that, perhaps residual potential is the remaining capacity after placing the item. 

Alternatively, the residual potential could be the remaining capacity of the bin before placing the item. So, bins_remain_cap[i]. The idea is that a bin with smaller remaining capacity (more filled) is better to pack into, as it's closer to being full. 

So, combining the two factors: how tight the fit is (remaining_space_after) and how filled the bin is before adding the item (remaining_capacity_before). 

For example, the priority could be (1 / remaining_space_after) * (1 / remaining_capacity_before). But this would multiply two terms, which the analysis warns against if they are not independent. However, the analysis of the better code mentions that multiplicative terms can be okay if factors are independent. 

Alternatively, using a weighted sum. For example, 0.618*(1/remaining_space_after) + 0.382*(1/remaining_capacity_before), inspired by the golden ratio mentioned in the analysis. 

But how to handle exact fits. The v0 code gives them infinite priority, which ensures they are chosen first. But using np.isclose is better for floating points. 

Putting this all together:

1. Check for exact fits using a tolerance (np.isclose) to avoid floating point issues.
2. For non-exact fits, compute a score that combines the inverse of the remaining space after placing the item (to encourage tight fits) and the inverse of the bin's remaining capacity before placing the item (to encourage filling existing bins).
3. Use a geometric mean or another balanced combination of these two factors to avoid over-penalizing.
4. Assign -inf to bins that can't fit the item.

So, the code steps:

- Calculate remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item
- exact_fit_mask = np.isclose(remaining_space, 0, atol=1e-9)
- valid_mask = remaining_space >= 0
- For valid bins not exact fit:
   - tightness = 1 / (remaining_space + 1e-9)
   - utilization = 1 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)  # inverse of remaining capacity before
   - combined_score = np.sqrt(tightness * utilization)  # geometric mean
- Assign np.inf to exact fits, combined_score to valid, else -inf

This combines the tightness of the fit and the utilization of the bin. The geometric mean ensures both factors contribute equally without one dominating. 

Testing edge cases: if a bin is almost full (small remaining capacity), utilization term is high. If the item fits tightly, tightness is high. The combination prefers bins that are both already utilized and can tightly fit the item.

This approach addresses the analysis points: uses smooth gradients (sqrt product), combines tight packing and flexibility (utilization and tightness), handles floating points with tolerance, and avoids over-penalizing with multiplicative terms by using geometric mean.

So, the code would look like:

def priority_v2(...):
    # Check exact fits with tolerance
    remaining_space = bins_remain_cap - item
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_space, 0, atol=1e-9)
    valid = remaining_space >= 0
    # Compute tightness and utilization
    tightness = 1 / (remaining_space + 1e-9)
    utilization = 1 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-9)
    # Geometric mean of tightness and utilization
    combined = np.sqrt(tightness * utilization)
    # Assign priorities
    priorities = np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, np.where(valid, combined, -np.inf))
    return priorities

But wait, utilization is 1/(bins_remain_cap + eps). So for a bin that is almost full (bins_remain_cap is small), utilization is large. So combining tightness (1/remaining_space_after) and utilization (1/remaining_capacity_before) via geometric mean would prioritize bins that are both already nearly full and where the item fits tightly.

This seems like a good balance. The docstring should explain that it combines exact fit detection with a geometric mean of tightness and existing utilization to balance immediate packing and bin consolidation.

Testing this against the analysis points: it uses a combination inspired by harmonic (1/remaining) and residual (utilization, which relates to the bin's current state), geometric mean for balance, handles floating points with isclose and epsilons, and avoids over-penalizing by not using multiplicative penalties but a combined score.

This should be better than v0 and v1 by combining their strengths (exact fit, tight packing from v0; utilization consideration from v1's density but correctly implemented) while avoiding their weaknesses (v0's lack of utilization, v1's incorrect density and penalties).
