Okay, I need to create a priority function for the online bin packing problem. The goal is to assign a priority score to each bin based on the item's size and the remaining capacities of the bins. The highest priority bin will be chosen to place the item.

First, let's think about existing heuristics. The Best Fit heuristic places the item in the bin with the least remaining space that can still accommodate it. So maybe the priority could be based on the remaining capacity after placing the item. But I need to make sure that bins that can't fit the item get a low priority, maybe negative infinity so they're ignored.

Another idea is to consider how well the item fills the bin. For example, if placing the item leaves a small remaining space, that's good. So the priority could be (remaining capacity - item size), but only if that's non-negative. Wait, no, because if the bin's remaining capacity is >= item size, then the new remaining would be (current_remain - item). So the priority could be (current_remain - item), but higher values mean more space left. Wait, but Best Fit picks the bin with the smallest remaining space after placement. So maybe the priority should be -(remaining_after), so that the smallest remaining_after has the highest priority (since it's the most negative, but when sorted, the highest priority would be the max of the negative values). Hmm, maybe I need to invert that.

Wait, the priority function returns a score for each bin, and the bin with the highest score is selected. So for Best Fit, after placing the item, the remaining space is (current_remain - item). We want to choose the bin where this value is the smallest (but non-negative). So the priority for each bin would be (current_remain >= item) ? (1/(current_remain - item + 1e-9)) : -infinity. Because if the bin can't fit the item, it's invalid. So the priority is higher for bins where (current_remain - item) is smaller. By taking the reciprocal, smaller values become larger priorities. Adding a small epsilon to avoid division by zero.

Alternatively, maybe use the negative of (current_remain - item) for valid bins. Then the largest negative (i.e., the smallest remaining after) would be the highest priority. Wait, but if we use negative (current_remain - item), then for a bin that after placement has 0 remaining, the score is 0. For a bin that has 1 remaining, the score is -1. So the highest score is 0, which is correct. So the priority would be (current_remain - item) if the bin can fit, else -infinity. Wait, but in that case, the bin with the smallest (current_remain - item) would have the highest priority. Because if you subtract item from current_remain, the smaller that value is, the better. So the priority would be (current_remain - item) but we want to maximize that. Wait, no. Wait, if a bin has current_remain 5 and item is 3, then after placement, remaining is 2. Another bin with current_remain 4 and item 3 would have remaining 1. The second bin is better. So the priority for the first is 2, the second is 1. But we want the second bin to have higher priority. So if the priority is (current_remain - item), then the second bin's priority is 1, which is lower than 2. That's the opposite of what we want. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, right. So Best Fit is to choose the bin with the smallest remaining space after placing the item. So the priority should be higher for bins where (current_remain - item) is smaller. So the priority could be -(current_remain - item) for valid bins. Then, the bin with the smallest (current_remain - item) would have the highest priority (since -(smallest) is the largest negative, but wait, no. Let's see: if bin A has (current_remain - item) = 1, bin B has 0. Then -(1) is -1, -(0) is 0. So bin B's priority is higher. That's correct. So the priority is -(current_remain - item) if the bin can fit the item, else -infinity. So the code would compute for each bin:

if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:
    priority[i] = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)
else:
    priority[i] = -inf

But in numpy, we can vectorize this. So:

valid = bins_remain_cap >= item
priority = np.where(valid, -(bins_remain_cap - item), -np.inf)

But wait, the function needs to return the priority scores. So this would assign higher priority (i.e., higher score) to bins where (current_remain - item) is smaller. Because for example, if two bins have (current_remain - item) as 2 and 1, their priorities would be -2 and -1. The one with -1 is higher, so the bin with remaining 1 after placement is chosen. Wait, no. Wait, the priority is -(current_remain - item). So for a bin that after placement has 0 remaining, the priority is 0. For a bin that after placement has 1 remaining, the priority is -1. Wait, no. Wait, if current_remain is 3, item is 3: current_remain - item is 0. So priority is 0. If current_remain is 4, item is 3: current_remain - item is 1, priority is -1. So the bin with 0 remaining has higher priority (0) than the one with -1. So that's correct. So the code would correctly implement Best Fit.

But maybe there's a better heuristic. For example, considering not just the remaining space after placement, but also other factors. For instance, some heuristics consider the "exact fit" as the best. So if a bin's remaining capacity exactly matches the item size, that's the best. So perhaps we can prioritize those bins first.

Another approach is the Worst Fit heuristic, which places the item in the bin with the largest remaining space after placement. But that's the opposite of Best Fit. So the priority would be (current_remain - item) for valid bins, and the highest value is selected. But that's not as efficient as Best Fit in general.

But the user is asking for a new priority function, perhaps combining multiple factors. Let's think of a heuristic that combines Best Fit with some other consideration. For example, considering the utilization of the bin. Or maybe the number of items already in the bin. But in online BPP, we don't track the number of items, only the remaining capacity.

Another idea is to use a hybrid approach. For example, prioritize bins where the remaining capacity after placing the item is as small as possible (Best Fit), but also give a higher priority to bins that are closer to being filled. Alternatively, we can add a term that gives higher priority to bins that have a remaining capacity close to the average item size. But how to compute that in an online setting where we don't know future items?

Alternatively, we can use a heuristic that combines the Best Fit with a look-ahead for potential future items. But since it's online, we can't know future items. So perhaps we can use the current item's size as a hint. For example, if the current item is large, maybe we want to leave smaller gaps, but if it's small, maybe we can leave larger gaps that could fit more items.

Wait, but how to model that. Let's think: the priority could be (current_remain - item) + (item / current_remain). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the priority could be (current_remain - item) * (current_remain). Hmm, not sure.

Another approach is to use a scoring function that combines the remaining space after placement and the reciprocal of the remaining space. For example, the priority could be (1 / (current_remain - item + 1e-9)) if the bin can fit the item. This way, bins that have a smaller remaining space after placement get a higher score. Because 1/(small number) is larger. So for example, if after placement, the remaining is 0, the priority is 1/0.000000001 which is a very large number. If remaining is 1, it's 1/1.000000001 which is about 1. So this would prioritize bins that have the smallest remaining space after placement, which is exactly Best Fit. So this is another way to implement Best Fit.

But maybe the user wants a different heuristic. Let's think of a different approach. For example, the "Almost Worst Fit" or other variations. But perhaps a more creative approach.

Another idea is to consider the sum of the item size and the remaining capacity. Wait, not sure. Or maybe the ratio of the item size to the remaining capacity. For example, if the item is 3 and the bin's remaining is 5, the ratio is 3/5=0.6. If another bin has remaining 4, the ratio is 0.75. Higher ratio means the item is a larger portion of the remaining space. So higher ratio is better. So the priority could be (item / bins_remain_cap) if the bin can fit the item. But this is similar to Best Fit in some cases. For example, a bin with remaining 3 and item 3 would have ratio 1.0, which is the highest. A bin with remaining 4 and item 3 would have 0.75, which is lower. So this would prioritize exact fits first, then others. But this is different from Best Fit. For example, if a bin has remaining 5 and item 3, the ratio is 0.6. Another bin has remaining 4, item 3: ratio 0.75. So the second bin is better. But after placing, the remaining is 1 in the second bin, which is better than 2 in the first. So this approach would also work. So this is a different heuristic.

Alternatively, the priority could be (item + (current_remain - item)) which is just current_remain. But that's the Worst Fit, which is not good.

Hmm. So the user wants a priority_v2 that is different from the trivial example (which returns all zeros). The example given is priority_v1, which is a trivial function. So the user wants a more sophisticated version.

Let me think of combining multiple factors. For example, a priority that combines Best Fit with a term that encourages bins that are more filled. For example, the priority could be (current_remain - item) + (1 / (current_remain + 1e-9)). Wait, but how to balance these terms. Alternatively, the priority could be a weighted sum of different factors.

Alternatively, consider the following heuristic: prioritize bins where the item fits exactly (exact fit), then those that leave the least space (Best Fit), and also consider the current remaining capacity. For example, the priority could be:

- If the bin can fit the item exactly (current_remain == item), highest priority (e.g., a large value like 1e9)
- Else, if the bin can fit the item, priority is (1 / (current_remain - item + 1e-9)) - (current_remain / bin_capacity)
- Else, -inf

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, for the exact fit, assign a very high priority. Then for others, use Best Fit.

Another idea is to use a dynamic scoring that adjusts based on the item size. For example, if the item is large, prioritize bins that can fit it exactly. If the item is small, prioritize bins that have the least remaining space after placing it.

But how to implement that. For example, if the item is larger than half the bin size, then prioritize exact fits. Otherwise, use Best Fit.

But in the online setting, we don't know the bin size (assuming it's fixed, say 1.0). So the item's size is relative to the bin's capacity. Let's assume the bin capacity is 1.0 (normalized). Then, if the item is >0.5, we want to place it in a bin that can fit it exactly. Otherwise, use Best Fit.

But how to code that. For each bin, check if the remaining capacity is exactly equal to the item. If yes, assign highest priority. Otherwise, proceed with Best Fit.

So the priority could be:

priority = np.where(
    bins_remain_cap == item,
    1e9,  # highest priority for exact fit
    np.where(
        bins_remain_cap >= item,
        -(bins_remain_cap - item),  # Best Fit for others
        -np.inf
    )
)

But this would first check for exact fits. If any bin has remaining capacity exactly equal to the item, it will be chosen. Otherwise, use Best Fit. This combines the Exact Fit and Best Fit heuristics.

This could be a good approach. Let's call this priority_v2. So the code would first check for exact fits, then apply Best Fit.

Another variation could be to prioritize bins that, after placing the item, leave a remaining capacity that is a multiple of the average item size. But since it's online, we don't know the average. Alternatively, use the current item's size as a reference. For example, prioritize bins where the remaining after placement is a multiple of the current item's size. But this might not be useful.

Alternatively, the priority could be the negative of the remaining space after placement, plus a term that encourages bins that are more filled. For example, (current_remain - item) is the remaining after placement. The negative of that is -(current_remain - item). But also, the current_remain before placement is (current_remain). So maybe the priority is a combination of these two factors. For example:

priority = -(current_remain - item) + 0.1 * (1 - current_remain)

But this is arbitrary. The weights would need to be tuned. However, without knowing the problem instances, it's hard to choose the right weights.

Alternatively, the priority could be based on the sum of the item's size and the current remaining capacity. Wait, that's just the bin's original capacity. Not helpful.

Another idea: for each bin, calculate how much the item contributes to filling the bin. For example, (item / bin_capacity) + (current_remain / bin_capacity). But bin_capacity is fixed, so this is (item + current_remain) / bin_capacity. But current_remain is the remaining capacity before placing the item. So after placing, the remaining is current_remain - item. So this sum is (item + current_remain) = (current_remain_initial - sum_of_previous_items) + item. Not sure.

Alternatively, the priority could be the item's size divided by the remaining capacity after placement. For example, item / (current_remain - item). This would be higher for bins where the item takes up a larger portion of the remaining space. But this is similar to the ratio approach.

Hmm. Let's think of a different approach. The "First Fit" heuristic places the item in the first bin that can accommodate it. But that's not based on priority scores. So for priority functions, the priority for the first applicable bin would be higher. But in our case, the priority function needs to assign scores to all bins, so the first bin that can fit would have a higher score than others. But how to model that. For example, assign higher priority to bins with lower indices. But that's not dynamic.

Alternatively, the priority could be based on the remaining capacity after placement, but also the current remaining capacity. For example, a bin that has a remaining capacity of 0.9 and the item is 0.5 would leave 0.4. Another bin with remaining 0.6 and item 0.5 leaves 0.1. The second is better. But if there's a third bin with remaining 0.5, which is an exact fit, that's best.

So combining exact fit and best fit.

So the code for priority_v2 could be:

def priority_v2(item, bins_remain_cap):
    # Check for exact fit first
    exact_fit = (bins_remain_cap == item)
    # For bins that can fit, calculate best fit (smallest remaining after)
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid = (remaining_after >= 0)
    # Assign a high score to exact fits, then best fit
    # For exact fits, priority is 1e9, else if valid, priority is (1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9)), else -inf
    # But 1/(remaining_after) makes smaller remaining_after have higher priority
    # So combine exact fit and best fit
    priority = np.where(
        exact_fit,
        1e9,  # highest priority for exact fit
        np.where(
            valid,
            1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9),  # best fit
            -np.inf
        )
    )
    return priority

This way, exact fits get the highest priority. For other valid bins, the priority is the reciprocal of the remaining space after placement, which prioritizes smaller remaining spaces. Bins that can't fit the item get -inf.

This combines the Exact Fit and Best Fit heuristics. This could potentially perform better than pure Best Fit by reducing the number of bins when exact fits are available.

Another variation could be to add a small penalty to non-exact fits. For example, subtract a small value from the priority of non-exact fits. But in the current setup, exact fits are already prioritized.

Alternatively, the priority for non-exact fits could be (1 / (remaining_after + 1e-9)) - 0.1. But this might not be necessary.

Testing this function: suppose bins_remain_cap is [3, 4, 5], item is 3. The exact fit is the first bin (3-3=0). So priority for first bin is 1e9, others are 1/(4-3)=1 and 1/(5-3)=0.5. So the first bin is selected. If the item is 3 and bins_remain_cap is [4,3,5], then the second bin is exact fit. If the item is 3 and bins_remain_cap is [4,2,5], then no exact fit. The valid bins are 4-3=1, 5-3=2. The priorities are 1/1=1 and 1/2=0.5, so the first valid bin (remaining 4) is selected, which leaves 1.

This seems to work as intended.

So the code for priority_v2 would be as above.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritizes bins that exactly fit the item, then uses a combination of
    remaining capacity utilization and inverse gap size for other valid bins."""
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    
    # Reward exact fits with highest priority
    exact_fit_priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap == item, np.inf, 0)
    
    # For non-exact fits, combine inverse gap size and remaining capacity utilization
    gap_priority = np.where(valid_mask, 1/(remaining_after + 1e-9), -np.inf)
    utilization_priority = np.where(valid_mask, (bins_remain_cap - remaining_after)/bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    
    # Combine priorities with weighted sum
    combined_priority = gap_priority * 0.7 + utilization_priority * 0.3
    
    # Override with exact fit priority
    return np.where(exact_fit_priority > 0, np.inf, combined_priority)
