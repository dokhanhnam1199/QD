Okay, I need to create a priority_v2 function that combines elements from the better code (priority_v0) and the worse code (priority_v1), based on the analysis provided. Let me first recall what each version does.

The better code (v0) uses a geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential. Fill efficiency is item divided by bin's remaining capacity (plus a small epsilon to avoid division by zero), and residual potential is the square root of the remaining space after placing the item. It also adds a bonus for exact fits. The synergy score is the sqrt of the product of fill efficiency and residual potential, which is effectively a geometric mean. The constants (eps_fill, eps_residual, etc.) are carefully calibrated.

The worse code (v1) uses harmonic efficiency (1 over remaining_after) multiplied by the square root of the original bin capacity. It boosts exact fits to infinity. However, the analysis mentions that overcomplicating with terms like quantum-inspired or hyperbolic transforms can introduce noise. The worse code's harmonic approach might not be as effective as the geometric mean in v0.

The analysis says that the best heuristics balance simplicity with precision-tuned components. So, combining the strengths of v0 and v1, but avoiding the pitfalls. Let's see what elements from v1 can be useful. The v1 code uses exact fit detection with a bonus, which v0 also does. The harmonic term in v1 might not be as good as the fill efficiency in v0. However, the residual potential in v0 is based on the remaining space after placing the item, while v1's residual is sqrt of the original bin capacity. Wait, in v0, residual_potential is sqrt(remaining_after), but in v1, residual is sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Hmm.

Wait, the analysis mentions that the better code uses "sqrt residual space" (i.e., remaining after placing the item) for future flexibility, while the worse code uses sqrt of original capacity. The analysis says that the better approach is to use the residual after placing the item. So, v0's residual_potential is better.

So, the key elements from v0 are the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential (sqrt of remaining_after), plus the exact fit bonus. The worse code (v1) uses harmonic (1/remaining_after) and sqrt of original capacity. But according to the analysis, the worse code's approach is less effective. So, perhaps the better approach is to stick with v0's structure but maybe incorporate some elements from v1 that are still valid, like the exact fit detection, but v0 already does that with the perfection_bonus.

Wait, the analysis says that the best heuristics use a focused geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential with calibrated constants. The worse code's harmonic approach is part of the less effective methods. So, combining the two would mean taking the better parts of v0 and possibly avoiding the parts that made v1 worse.

But the user wants to combine elements from both. So, perhaps take the exact fit detection from both (since both have it), but use the geometric mean approach from v0. The v1 code uses harmonic efficiency (1/gap) which might not be as good as fill efficiency (item / bin_cap). The analysis also mentions that the worse code's use of harmonic and residual (original capacity) is less effective.

So, the improved function should retain the core of v0's approach but maybe adjust some parts. For example, the v0 uses fill_efficiency (item / bin_remain_cap) and residual_potential (sqrt(remaining_after)), then combines them with geometric mean. The exact fit is handled with a bonus. The v1 uses harmonic (1/remaining_after) and sqrt(bins_remain_cap), which is different.

Wait, in v1, the residual is sqrt of the original bin capacity (bins_remain_cap), not the remaining after placing the item. That's different from v0's residual_potential. The analysis says that the better code uses residual space (remaining_after) for future flexibility, which is better. So, the v0's approach here is better.

So, the key elements to combine would be the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential (from v0), the exact fit bonus (both have it), and perhaps the use of sqrt in residual potential. The worse code's harmonic term is not as good, so we should avoid that.

Wait, but the user says to combine elements from both. Maybe take the exact fit detection from v1 (using np.isclose) and the perfection_bonus from v0. But both already do that. Alternatively, maybe use the harmonic approach but in a way that's better integrated. But according to the analysis, the worse code's approach is less effective. So perhaps the better approach is to stick with v0's method but adjust the constants or add a small element from v1 that's beneficial.

Alternatively, maybe the residual_potential in v0 is sqrt(remaining_after), but in v1, the residual is sqrt(bins_remain_cap). Maybe combining both? For example, using a combination of the residual after and the original capacity. But that might complicate things. The analysis says that overengineering is bad, so perhaps not.

Another point from the analysis: the best heuristics use calibrated constants. So, the improved function should use well-tuned epsilons and weights, as in v0.

So, the improved function (priority_v2) would take the core of v0's approach but perhaps adjust some parts. For example, in v0, the synergy score is the sqrt of fill_efficiency * residual_potential. That's equivalent to the geometric mean. The v1 uses harmonic * residual, which is a product (geometric mean via multiplication, but not sqrt). However, the analysis says that the worse code's approach is less effective.

Therefore, the improved function should stick with the v0's approach but perhaps incorporate the exact fit detection with a higher weight, or adjust the way the perfection_bonus is applied. Alternatively, maybe use a different combination of fill efficiency and residual potential.

Wait, the analysis mentions that the better code uses "synergy_score = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)", which is the geometric mean. The worse code uses "harmonic * residual" which is a product but not sqrt. The analysis says that the better code's approach is more effective.

So, the key elements to keep from v0 are:

- fill_efficiency = item / (bin_remain_cap + eps)
- residual_potential = sqrt(remaining_after + eps)
- synergy_score as geometric mean (sqrt of product)
- perfection_bonus for exact fits

The worse code's elements that could be considered are:

- Using harmonic (1/remaining_after) but that's not as good as fill_efficiency.
- Using sqrt of original bin capacity (bins_remain_cap) instead of remaining_after. But analysis says that's worse.

So, perhaps the improved function is similar to v0 but with some tweaks. For example, maybe the residual_potential could be a combination of sqrt(remaining_after) and another term. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, adjust the perfection_bonus to be more aggressive, as in v1 where exact fits get np.inf. But in v0, the perfection_bonus adds a weight. The analysis says that the best heuristics use calibrated constants, so perhaps the exact fit should be given a very high priority, like in v1 where it's set to infinity. However, in v0, the exact fit is given a bonus weight but not infinity. Let's check the code:

In v0:
perfection_bonus = np.isclose(...) * perfection_bonus_weight
scores = np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score + perfection_bonus, -np.inf)

So, if a bin is an exact fit, it adds the perfection_bonus_weight to the synergy_score. But in v1, exact fits are set to np.inf. The analysis says that the better code uses the bonus, but perhaps setting exact fits to infinity ensures they are chosen first. However, the analysis also mentions that the worse code's approach of boosting exact fits to maximum priority is part of the better approach. Wait, in the analysis, comparing v0 and v1, the better code (v0) uses a perfection_bonus, while the worse code (v1) uses np.inf for exact fits. But according to the analysis, the better code's approach is better. So, perhaps the perfection_bonus is better than setting to infinity because it allows for a more nuanced priority when multiple bins are exact fits. Or maybe setting to infinity is better to ensure exact fits are prioritized.

Wait, in the analysis, the better code (v0) is described as using "perfection_bonus" which is a weight added to the synergy score. The worse code (v1) sets exact fits to infinity. The analysis says that the better heuristics balance immediate tight packing with future flexibility, using geometric mean. So, perhaps in v0, even if a bin is an exact fit, the score is synergy_score plus a bonus, which might not be as high as infinity. But in v1, exact fits are set to infinity, which would make them the top priority. However, the analysis says that the better code is v0, which uses the bonus. So, perhaps the bonus is sufficient and better calibrated.

But the user wants to combine elements from both. So, maybe in the improved function, exact fits are given a very high score (like infinity) to ensure they are chosen first, as in v1, but also use the geometric mean approach from v0. However, in v0, the exact fit is part of the valid_mask and gets the synergy_score plus the bonus. But if the exact fit's remaining_after is zero, then residual_potential would be sqrt(0 + eps_residual), which is a small value. But fill_efficiency would be item/(bin_remain_cap + eps_fill). If the bin_remain_cap is exactly equal to the item, then fill_efficiency is item/(item + eps_fill) â‰ˆ 1. So, the synergy_score would be sqrt(1 * sqrt(eps_residual)), which is sqrt(sqrt(eps_residual)), but then adding the perfection_bonus_weight (which is 2.8) would make the score higher than other bins. However, in v1, exact fits are set to infinity, which would override any other scores.

So, perhaps combining both approaches: if a bin is an exact fit, set its score to infinity, otherwise use the synergy score. That way, exact fits are prioritized first. This is what v1 does. But in v0, the exact fit is given a bonus but not infinity. The analysis says that the better code (v0) uses the bonus, but maybe combining the two would mean using the infinity for exact fits and the synergy score otherwise. Let's see.

In the analysis, the better code (v0) is better because it balances tight packing and future flexibility. The worse code (v1) has unnecessary complexity. So, perhaps the improved function should take the exact fit handling from v1 (setting to infinity) and the synergy score from v0. But wait, in v0, the exact fit is part of the valid_mask and gets the synergy_score plus a bonus. But in v1, exact fits are set to infinity regardless of other factors. So, combining these would mean: for exact fits, return infinity; for other valid bins, compute the synergy score as in v0; invalid bins get -infinity.

But would that be better? According to the analysis, the better code uses the bonus, but maybe setting exact fits to infinity is better. Let me think. If a bin is an exact fit, placing the item there perfectly fills the bin, which is optimal. So, it's better to prioritize that. So, in the improved function, exact fits should have the highest priority. So, in the code, for exact fits, set their score to infinity, and for others, use the synergy score. That way, exact fits are chosen first, which is optimal.

So, the improved function would:

1. Check for exact fits (using np.isclose with a tolerance).
2. For exact fits, set their score to infinity.
3. For other valid bins, compute the synergy score as in v0 (geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential).
4. Invalid bins get -infinity.

This combines the exact fit handling from v1 (infinity) with the synergy score from v0. Additionally, the v0's use of perfection_bonus is replaced by directly setting the score to infinity for exact fits. This might be more effective.

But wait, in v0, the exact fit is part of the valid_mask and gets the synergy_score plus a bonus. If we instead set exact fits to infinity, that would ensure they are selected first, which is good. So, the code would look like:

remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol)

fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill)
residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + eps_residual)
synergy = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)

scores = np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, np.where(valid_mask, synergy, -np.inf))

But then, the perfection_bonus from v0 is not used. However, this approach combines the exact fit detection from v1 (infinity) with the synergy score from v0. This might be better because exact fits are prioritized first, which is optimal.

Additionally, the analysis mentions that the better code uses calibrated constants. So, the improved function should retain the calibrated epsilons and parameters from v0, such as eps_fill, eps_residual, atol_perfection, etc.

Wait, in v0, the perfection_bonus is added to the synergy_score. But if we instead set exact fits to infinity, then the perfection_bonus is not needed. So, the code would be:

def priority_v2(...):
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >=0
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=atol_perfection)

    fill_efficiency = item / (bins_remain_cap + eps_fill)
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + eps_residual)
    synergy_score = np.sqrt(fill_efficiency * residual_potential)

    scores = np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, np.where(valid_mask, synergy_score, -np.inf))
    return scores

This combines the exact fit handling from v1 (infinity) with the synergy score calculation from v0. The parameters like eps_fill, eps_residual, and atol_perfection are retained from v0 for numerical stability and precision.

But the analysis also mentions that the better code uses "sqrt residual space" for future flexibility. The synergy_score in v0 is the geometric mean of fill efficiency and residual potential, which is sqrt(fill * residual). This is maintained in the new code.

So, this approach combines the best of both versions: prioritizing exact fits with infinity (from v1) and using the synergy score from v0 for non-exact fits. The parameters from v0 ensure numerical stability and calibrated constants.

Additionally, the analysis mentions that the worse code's use of harmonic efficiency (1/gap) is less effective than the fill efficiency used in v0. So, the improved function correctly uses fill efficiency.

Therefore, the improved priority_v2 function would look like this, combining the exact fit handling from v1 and the synergy score from v0, while retaining the calibrated parameters.

```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Optimal exact-fit prioritization with geometric synergy between 
    immediate packing density and future flexibility potential."""
    
    remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item
    valid_mask = remaining_after >= 0
    exact_fit = np.isclose(remaining_after, 0, atol=5e-6)  # Precision-tuned
    
    # Synergy components with stabilized denominators
    fill_ratio = item / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-7)  # Prevent div0 while preserving ratio accuracy
    residual_potential = np.sqrt(np.maximum(remaining_after, 0) + 1e-7)  # Future flexibility metric
    synergy = np.sqrt(fill_ratio * residual_potential)  # Geometric balance
    
    # Strategic priority assignment
    return np.where(exact_fit, np.inf, np.where(valid_mask, synergy, -np.inf))
```
