Okay, let's refine self-reflection for designing better bin packing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding generic advice.

*   **Keywords:** Feasibility Handling, Priority Scoring, Weighted Combinations, Adaptive Strategies.
*   **Advice:** Systematically explore strategies to repair infeasible solutions. Design priority scores based on dynamic bin/item characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Simply "considering" factors or vaguely mentioning "waste minimization."
*   **Explanation:** Move from abstract considerations to concrete actions involving feasibility management and dynamic adjustments of priority.
