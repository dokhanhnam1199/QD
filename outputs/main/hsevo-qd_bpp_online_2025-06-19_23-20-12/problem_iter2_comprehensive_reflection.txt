Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, keeping in mind what to avoid in "Ineffective Self-Reflection" (which is currently empty, so we're starting fresh).

Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multifaceted Evaluation, Weighted Factors, Waste Reduction, Empirical Validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics by weighting diverse, relevant factors based on their impact and considering waste reduction strategies.
*   **Avoid:** Over-simplification via single ratios, neglecting waste streams, premature implementation without testing various factor weightings.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics require a holistic view. Combine weighted factors (including waste) validated through rigorous testing and comparison of different parameter settings.
