**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (11th), we see that the first heuristic considers both fill ratio and waste, while the eleventh focuses solely on the ratio of item size to remaining capacity and uses logarithms. (2nd) vs (12th) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the functions are identical. (11th) vs (12th) ...; Comparing (20th) vs (11th), we see the functions are also identical. Overall: The top 10 heuristics are identical and the last 10 heuristics are identical, suggesting a significant performance difference between the two versions. The first version uses a complex calculation involving waste normalization and fill ratio, while the second uses log ratios. The first one seems to try to reduce waste.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and normalize them appropriately. Avoid relying solely on simple ratios; incorporating waste minimization can significantly improve performance. Thoroughly test different strategies before settling on a final implementation.
