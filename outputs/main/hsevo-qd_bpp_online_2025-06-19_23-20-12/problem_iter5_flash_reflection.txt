**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a combination of fill ratio and normalized waste to determine bin priority, while the worst uses only the negative logarithm of the ratio of item size to bin capacity. Heuristics 1st through 10th are identical, as are heuristics 11th through 20th. Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the former explicitly handles infeasible bins (where the item doesn't fit), and the latter doesn't. The better performing heuristics (1st-10th) incorporate a waste calculation which can lead to better overall bin packing by penalizing bins that would leave too much unused space, promoting better fill.
The use of `np.where` in the better heuristics ensures that only feasible bins are considered when calculating priorities, and assigns a negative infinity priority to infeasible bins, effectively excluding them. The other heuristics do not consider feasibility. The better heuristics also normalizes waste by the maximum bin capacity. The weight fill and waste is also better. Overall: The better heuristics (1st-10th) combine fill ratio and waste normalization, handling infeasible bins correctly, using np.where, and weighting the fill and waste to optimize bin usage.

**Experience:**
When designing bin packing heuristics, prioritize minimizing waste and maximizing fill ratio. Explicitly handle infeasible bin scenarios. Incorporate normalization to make values comparable. Experimenting with weighted combinations of multiple factors to generate priority scores can improve performance.
