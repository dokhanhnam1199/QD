{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing bin packing heuristics, prioritize minimizing waste and maximizing fill ratio. Explicitly handle infeasible bin scenarios. Incorporate normalization to make values comparable. Experimenting with weighted combinations of multiple factors to generate priority scores can improve performance.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and normalize them appropriately. Avoid relying solely on simple ratios; incorporating waste minimization can significantly improve performance. Thoroughly test different strategies before settling on a final implementation.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
