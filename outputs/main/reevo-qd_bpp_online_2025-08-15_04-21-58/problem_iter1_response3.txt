    # A bin that is almost full after placing the item is desirable.
    # Therefore, we want to assign a higher priority to bins that result in a smaller
    # remaining capacity *after* the item is placed.
    # To encourage "almost full", we can use the negative of the remaining capacity.
    # We also want to slightly favor bins that were already closer to full if multiple
    # bins have the same remaining capacity after placement. This is a heuristic choice.
    
    # Option 1: Prioritize smallest remaining space. Higher priority for smaller remaining_after_placement.
    # This can be achieved by taking the negative of remaining_after_placement.
    # To break ties and slightly favor bins that were initially closer to full, we can
    # add a small bonus based on initial remaining capacity, but this might complicate the "almost full" idea.
    # A simpler "almost full" heuristic: focus on minimizing the gap.
    
    # For bins where the item fits, the priority is the negative of the remaining capacity after placement.
    # This means bins that are almost full (small positive remaining_after_placement) will have
    # a less negative (higher) priority.
    priorities[fits_mask] = -remaining_after_placement[fits_mask]

    # Consider a tie-breaking mechanism: if two bins result in the same remaining capacity,
    # maybe we prefer the one that was originally less full? Or more full?
    # For "Almost Full Fit", we want the *least* remaining space.
    # If `remaining_after_placement` is the same for multiple bins, then those bins are equally "almost full".
    # A simple approach is to break ties arbitrarily or based on index, which np.argmax does.
    # If we want to favor bins that were *already* closer to full when they result in the same
    # `remaining_after_placement`, we could add a small value proportional to `bins_remain_cap`.
    # However, the core of "Almost Full Fit" is minimizing `remaining_after_placement`.

    # Let's refine: We want to minimize `remaining_after_placement`.
    # A common way to do this with maximization functions (like finding the max priority)
    # is to use a transformation like `-(remaining_after_placement)`.
    # A bin that is *almost full* will have a small positive `remaining_after_placement`.
    # The negative of this small positive number will be a negative number closest to zero,
    # thus having the highest priority among the eligible bins.

    # To make it more "almost full" specific, we could penalize bins that become too empty,
    # but that's not typically part of this strategy.

    # The current approach: priorities = - (bins_remain_cap - item) for bins that fit.
    # This effectively means we are prioritizing bins with the smallest positive `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # This aligns with "Almost Full Fit" by aiming to leave the minimum remaining capacity.

    # Let's add a small positive value for bins where it fits. The magnitude of this value
    # should reflect how "full" the bin is *after* placement.
    # The most "full" bin after placement is the one with `remaining_after_placement` closest to 0.
    # So, `-(remaining_after_placement)` works.

    # Example:
    # Bin capacities: [5, 10, 3] (total bin size 10)
    # Item size: 4
    # Bins remain cap: [5, 6, 10] (assuming previous placements)
    # Item fits in bins 0 and 1.
    # Remaining after placement: [1, 2, 6]
    # Priorities for fitting bins: [-1, -2]
    # The highest priority is -1, for the bin that becomes `1` remaining, meaning it was `5` and item `4` made it `1` (original bin capacity was 9).
    # Or, if bins_remain_cap are the current remaining capacities:
    # Bins: Bin1 (rem_cap 5), Bin2 (rem_cap 6), Bin3 (rem_cap 10)
    # Item: 4
    # Fits in Bin1 (5 >= 4), Bin2 (6 >= 4)
    # Remaining capacity after placement:
    # Bin1: 5 - 4 = 1
    # Bin2: 6 - 4 = 2
    # Bin3: 10 - 4 = 6 (but it doesn't fit)
    # Priority: For Bin1, priority is -1. For Bin2, priority is -2.
    # The highest priority is -1, which corresponds to Bin1, leaving the smallest remaining capacity. This IS "Almost Full Fit".

    # Let's consider another interpretation: we want to maximize the *used capacity* after placing the item.
    # Used capacity = item size. This isn't useful because the item size is constant.
    # We want to maximize the *total occupied space* in the bin after placement.
    # Occupied space = bin_capacity - remaining_capacity_after_placement
    # Occupied space = bin_capacity - (bins_remain_cap - item)
    # If bin_capacity is fixed (e.g., 10), then this is (10 - (bins_remain_cap - item))
    # which simplifies to (10 - bins_remain_cap) + item.
    # This is effectively prioritizing bins that are already more full.

    # The "Almost Full Fit" heuristic (also known as Best Fit Decreasing if pre-sorted)
    # typically means choosing the bin that leaves the LEAST remaining capacity.
    # This is equivalent to minimizing `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Since we return priorities for maximization, we want to maximize a function that
    # is minimized by `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Thus, `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` is the standard approach.

    # To be "almost full", we want the `remaining_after_placement` to be small and positive.
    # So, values like 1, 2, 3 are good. Values like 0 or negative are not for "almost full"
    # but rather "perfect fit" or "overfilled".

    # Let's refine the priority to be higher for smaller POSITIVE remaining spaces.
    # And perhaps, if multiple bins have the same minimal remaining space, we could pick
    # the one that had more capacity to begin with (allowing it to absorb more).
    # But the simplest "Almost Full Fit" is just minimizing `remaining_after_placement`.

    # Consider the range of `remaining_after_placement`. We want the smallest positive value.
    # If all fit, the maximum of `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` will correspond to the minimum `bins_remain_cap - item`.

    # For a bin to be "almost full", its `remaining_after_placement` should be small and positive.
    # The priority should reflect this.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and positive (e.g., 1, 2), this is good.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is large (e.g., 10), this is not "almost full".
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is zero or negative, the item fits exactly or doesn't fit.

    # Let's assign a priority that is higher for smaller POSITIVE remaining capacities.
    # A simple transformation: `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item)` for small positive values.
    # This could lead to division by zero.
    # A more robust way: `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` still seems the most direct way
    # to maximize the "least remaining capacity".

    # Let's add a tie-breaker that favors bins that were *more full* initially, IF
    # they result in the same `remaining_after_placement`. This might promote
    # using up larger bins first when they can be "almost filled" equally.

    # Modified priority: Prioritize bins with smaller `remaining_after_placement`.
    # Break ties by favoring bins that were initially closer to full (higher `bins_remain_cap`).
    
    # Calculate remaining capacity if item fits
    temp_remaining = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Prioritize bins where item fits. Higher priority for smaller remaining capacity.
    # Assign a base priority using the negative of the remaining capacity.
    # A smaller (more positive) value of `bins_remain_cap - item` leads to a larger (less negative) priority.
    priorities[fits_mask] = -temp_remaining[fits_mask]

    # Add a secondary criterion for tie-breaking or to emphasize "almost full":
    # If multiple bins have the same `remaining_after_placement`, we can favor
    # the one that was already closer to full. This means we add a value proportional
    # to `bins_remain_cap`. This can be subtle.
    # For truly "almost full", the smallest positive `remaining_after_placement` is key.

    # Let's consider a different angle: we want to penalize bins that leave a lot of empty space.
    # And we want to reward bins that are nearly full.
    # This is already captured by `- (remaining_capacity_after_placement)`.

    # A creative approach for "Almost Full Fit":
    # We want `remaining_after_placement` to be small and positive.
    # Consider `1 - (bins_remain_cap - item)` IF `bins_remain_cap - item` is in [0, 1].
    # And a decreasing function otherwise. This is getting complicated.

    # Simplest and most common interpretation of Almost Full Fit (or Best Fit):
    # Minimize `remaining_capacity_after_placement`.
    # So, maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.

    # Let's add a slight twist to emphasize "almost full" vs "perfect fit".
    # For a bin to be "almost full", its remaining capacity after placement should be
    # small and POSITIVE.
    # If `remaining_after_placement` is 0, it's a perfect fit, not "almost full".
    # If `remaining_after_placement` is negative, the item doesn't fit.

    # So, we want to maximize `bins_remain_cap - item` as long as it's positive,
    # and specifically close to zero.
    # The function `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` still achieves this if we only consider
    # bins where `bins_remain_cap - item >= 0`.

    # What if we want to reward bins that, after fitting the item, are closer to
    # the full bin capacity (e.g., if total capacity is 100, we want remaining space ~1-5).
    # This is captured by `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.

    # Let's consider making the priority score reflect how *close* the bin is to being full
    # after placing the item.
    # For a bin with remaining capacity `r` and total capacity `C`, the occupied space is `C - r`.
    # We want to maximize the occupied space, subject to `C - item >= r`.
    # Maximizing `C - r` is equivalent to minimizing `r`.
    # So, if `r = bins_remain_cap - item`, we want to maximize `-(bins_remain_cap - item)`.

    # A possible creative interpretation for "Almost Full Fit":
    # Give a very high priority to bins that, after fitting the item, have a
    # remaining capacity between 0 and a small threshold (e.g., 5% of bin capacity, if known).
    # And then, among those, pick the one with the minimum remaining capacity.

    # Let's assume a "small threshold" implicitly exists, and that maximizing
    # `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` naturally picks the bins that are closest to full.

    # Alternative: Use a function that maps small positive values of `remaining_after_placement`
    # to high priorities. E.g., if `remaining_after_placement` is `x`:
    # If `x` is between 0 and epsilon, priority is high.
    # If `x` is larger, priority is lower.

    # Let's refine `priority_v2` to specifically reward bins that are nearly full
    # *after* the item is placed.
    # The goal is to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If we want to be creative, we could introduce a penalty for leaving *too much* space,
    # even if it's the minimum.

    # Consider a penalty function for `remaining_after_placement`:
    # f(x) = -x if x >= 0 (standard)
    # What if we want to boost bins that have remaining capacity that is "small and positive"?
    # Let's try:
    # priority = -(bins_remain_cap - item) + small_bonus_for_small_positive_remaining
    
    # This can be achieved by using a transformation that amplifies smaller positive values.
    # For example, using `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)` could work, but requires epsilon.

    # Let's stick to a simpler, yet still "Almost Full Fit" interpretation.
    # We want the remaining capacity to be as small as possible, but non-negative.
    # This means we are looking for `min(bins_remain_cap - item)` where `bins_remain_cap - item >= 0`.
    # Maximizing `-(bins_remain_cap - item)` achieves this.

    # Let's try a small, creative enhancement:
    # If a bin has a remaining capacity of exactly 0 after placement (perfect fit),
    # this is often less desirable than a bin that is "almost full" but has a tiny bit of space left.
    # "Almost full" implies some small positive residual.
    # So, perhaps a perfect fit (remaining 0) should have a slightly lower priority than
    # a bin with remaining capacity 1.

    # This can be implemented by shifting the priority calculation.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item` is `x`, we want to prioritize small `x`.
    # Consider the function: `- (x + 1)` for `x >= 0`.
    # This would make a perfect fit (`x=0`) have priority `-1`.
    # A bin with remaining capacity `1` (`x=1`) would have priority `-2`.
    # This is the opposite of what we want.

    # We want to maximize a value that is large for small positive `x`.
    # So, maximizing `-x` for `x >= 0`.

    # Creative twist: Encourage bins that are close to "almost full",
    # i.e., their remaining capacity is positive but very small.
    # We can achieve this by penalizing larger remaining capacities more harshly.
    # Or, rewarding smaller remaining capacities more.

    # Let's try squaring the "negative remaining space" if it's positive.
    # If `bins_remain_cap - item = x >= 0`:
    # Priority = -(x^2)  ? No, this prioritizes `x` closer to 0 even more.

    # The core of "Almost Full Fit" is that `bins_remain_cap - item` is minimized.
    # To add creativity: let's make sure that the bins that are truly "almost full"
    # (i.e., have a small positive remainder) get a slight boost compared to
    # bins that are nearly empty but still fit.

    # Consider `f(x) = -x` for remaining space `x`.
    # We can modify this. For `x > 0`:
    # If `x` is small, we want a higher priority than `-x` implies.
    # If `x` is large, we want a lower priority.

    # Let's add a bonus based on how "full" the bin was *before* placing the item,
    # IF that bin also results in a minimal remaining capacity.

    # `remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item`
    # Priority = `-(remaining_after_placement)` for valid bins.

    # Consider a scenario:
    # Bin A: remaining_cap = 5. Item = 4. After: 1. Priority = -1.
    # Bin B: remaining_cap = 6. Item = 4. After: 2. Priority = -2.
    # Bin C: remaining_cap = 10. Item = 4. After: 6. Priority = -6.
    # Bin A is chosen.

    # What if we add a factor that emphasizes the "almost full" state?
    # For `remaining_after_placement = x > 0`, we want to give it a score.
    # Let's use a transformation `-(x + penalty_for_emptiness)`.
    # If we want to favor small `x`, we need a function that decreases steeply for `x`.

    # Let's consider `1 / (x + epsilon)` for `x > 0`.
    # Maximize `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)` for bins that fit.
    # This rewards small positive `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # We need a small `epsilon` to avoid division by zero and to ensure
    # that bins that don't fit have very low priority.

    # Let's use epsilon as a small fraction of the bin capacity (if we knew it), or a small constant.
    # For simplicity, let's use a small constant epsilon.
    
    epsilon = 1e-9  # A very small positive number

    # Calculate remaining capacity if the item fits.
    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item

    # Initialize priorities. Bins where item doesn't fit will have very low priority.
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)

    # For bins where the item fits (remaining_after_placement >= 0):
    fits_mask = remaining_after_placement >= 0

    # Creative approach for "Almost Full Fit":
    # We want to give higher priority to bins with smaller, *positive* remaining capacity.
    # The function `1.0 / (remaining_after_placement + epsilon)` achieves this.
    # As `remaining_after_placement` gets closer to 0 (from the positive side),
    # the priority increases.
    # If `remaining_after_placement` is large, the priority is smaller.
    
    # Add a slight bias to bins that were originally "more full" to break ties,
    # but the primary factor is the minimized residual capacity.
    # Let's consider prioritizing bins with smaller residual capacity `x`.
    # `priority = -x`.
    # To favor "almost full" more: what if we reward `x` being in a small range like `[0, K]`?
    
    # Consider this: We want to minimize `x = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # The bins with smallest `x` (and `x >= 0`) get selected.
    # Let's create a priority that maps these `x` values.
    # A function that is high for small positive `x` and drops off.

    # `priority = 1 / (x + epsilon)`:
    # If x = 1, priority = 1 / (1 + epsilon) ≈ 1
    # If x = 2, priority = 1 / (2 + epsilon) ≈ 0.5
    # If x = 10, priority = 1 / (10 + epsilon) ≈ 0.1
    # If x = 0, priority = 1 / epsilon (very large, desirable for perfect fit).
    
    # This gives highest priority to perfect fits, then bins with very small remainders.
    # If "Almost Full Fit" strictly means leaving a small POSITIVE remainder,
    # then maybe perfect fits should have slightly less priority than a bin leaving 1 unit.

    # Let's try this: `priority = -(x^2)` if `x > 0`, and a very high priority for `x=0`.
    # If `x = 0` (perfect fit), priority = large positive number.
    # If `x = 1`, priority = -(1^2) = -1.
    # If `x = 2`, priority = -(2^2) = -4.
    # This prioritizes perfect fit, then small positive residuals.
    
    # A better strategy to reward small positive residuals:
    # Let's prioritize bins that are *nearly* full by maximizing the inverse of the residual,
    # but also adding a penalty for leaving *too much* space.
    
    # Consider the number of available "slots" of size 1 unit in the remaining capacity.
    # We want to minimize `remaining_after_placement`.
    
    # Let's use a transformation that emphasizes small positive residuals:
    # For `x = bins_remain_cap - item`:
    # If `x < 0`: priority = -inf
    # If `x == 0`: priority = Some high value (e.g., a large positive number)
    # If `x > 0`: priority = A value that decreases as `x` increases, but stays positive for a while.

    # Let's use a function that decays for x > 0.
    # `priority = C - x` where C is a large constant. This is just maximizing `-x`.

    # What if we penalize the remaining capacity proportionally to the item size itself?
    # Or to the bin capacity? (If known).

    # Let's try to engineer "Almost Full Fit" more explicitly.
    # We want `bins_remain_cap - item` to be minimized *and* positive.
    # What if we give a score based on `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)`?
    # This favors smaller positive remainders.
    # The bin with the *smallest positive* remainder would have the highest score.

    # A key aspect of "Almost Full Fit" is aiming to reduce the number of bins
    # by filling them as much as possible without wasting much space.
    # So, we want the residual space to be minimal.

    # Let's consider the priority as `-(remaining_after_placement)`.
    # This is the most direct interpretation for "minimize remaining space".
    # If `remaining_after_placement` is `r`, we maximize `-r`.
    # This implies `r=0` is best, then `r=1`, then `r=2`, etc.

    # To make it more "Almost Full Fit", we want to prioritize bins that
    # are "nearly full".
    # This implies a preference for small POSITIVE `remaining_after_placement`.

    # Let's create a priority function that is high for small positive `x` and
    # lower for larger `x`, but also handles the `x=0` case.

    # Option:
    # 1. Perfect fits (`x=0`): High priority.
    # 2. Small positive residuals (`x` close to 0, e.g., 1, 2, 3): Very high priority.
    # 3. Larger positive residuals (`x` > some threshold): Lower priority.

    # This can be achieved by using an inverse function, but we need to ensure
    # it's well-behaved.

    # Let's try this:
    # Priority = `(MaxBinCapacity - item) - remaining_after_placement` for bins that fit.
    # This is essentially maximizing the used capacity `(MaxBinCapacity - remaining_after_placement)`.
    # `MaxBinCapacity` is not given, but if we consider the full bin capacity `C`,
    # then we want to maximize `C - (bins_remain_cap - item)`.
    # This is `(C - bins_remain_cap) + item`.
    # So, this means prioritizing bins that are already more full (`C - bins_remain_cap` is larger).

    # The standard "Almost Full Fit" or "Best Fit" is simply to minimize `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # Let's make a small variation:
    # Prioritize bins that have a small positive residual.
    # This means `bins_remain_cap - item` is small and > 0.

    # We can achieve this by penalizing larger residuals.
    # `priority = - (bins_remain_cap - item)` still works, but maybe we can add a slight bias.

    # Let's use this priority:
    # For bins where `bins_remain_cap - item >= 0`:
    # Priority = `1.0 / (bins_remain_cap - item + epsilon)`
    # This gives highest priority to perfect fits (where remainder is 0),
    # then to bins with smallest positive remainder.

    # Consider this: we want bins that become 'almost full'.
    # This means `bins_remain_cap - item` should be small and positive.
    # Let `r = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # If `r = 1`, priority is high. If `r = 2`, priority is lower. If `r = 0`, perfect fit.
    # The goal of "almost full" might slightly disfavor a perfect fit over a bin with just a little space.

    # So, let's try giving a score that is higher for small positive `r`.
    # `priority = 1.0 / (r + epsilon)` if `r > 0`
    # What about `r=0` (perfect fit)? Should it be highest, or second highest?
    # If "almost full" is the goal, a perfect fit might be less "almost full" than a bin with 1 unit left.

    # Let's set priority:
    # For fitting bins:
    # `remaining_after = bins_remain_cap - item`
    # If `remaining_after == 0`: priority = `K` (a large value for perfect fit)
    # If `remaining_after > 0`: priority = `1.0 / (remaining_after + epsilon)`
    # This gives priority 1/epsilon for perfect fit.
    # And priority 1/(1+epsilon) for remainder 1.
    # This still favors perfect fit.

    # Let's try prioritizing minimal positive remainder:
    # If `remaining_after == 0`: priority = `small_value`
    # If `remaining_after > 0`: priority = `1.0 / (remaining_after + epsilon)`
    # This gives priority 1/epsilon for remainder 1, and smaller for larger remainders.
    # And `small_value` for perfect fit. If `small_value` is less than `1/(1+epsilon)`, it works.

    # Let's implement this:
    # Highest priority for bins that, after placing the item, have the smallest positive remaining capacity.
    # Perfect fits (0 remaining capacity) get a good, but not necessarily the absolute highest, priority.
    
    epsilon = 1e-6 # Small epsilon to avoid division by zero and stabilize.
    
    # Calculate remaining capacity for each bin.
    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Initialize priorities. Use a very low value for bins that cannot fit the item.
    priorities = np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)
    
    # Mask for bins where the item fits.
    fits_mask = remaining_after_placement >= 0
    
    # Get the remaining capacities for bins where the item fits.
    fitting_remainders = remaining_after_placement[fits_mask]
    
    # Creative Priority for "Almost Full Fit":
    # We want to maximize the priority for bins that leave a small, positive remaining capacity.
    # The function `1.0 / (remainder + epsilon)` gives higher values for smaller `remainder`.
    # For `remainder = 0` (perfect fit), this would yield `1.0 / epsilon`, the highest possible priority.
    # If "Almost Full Fit" means we slightly prefer a bin that leaves a tiny bit of space over a perfect fit,
    # we can adjust.
    
    # Let's define "almost full" as having remaining capacity `r` such that `0 < r <= K` for some small `K`.
    # And among these, minimize `r`.
    
    # Proposed priority:
    # If `remaining_after_placement == 0`: priority = `1.0 / (epsilon)` (very high, for perfect fit)
    # If `remaining_after_placement > 0`: priority = `1.0 / (remaining_after_placement + epsilon)` (higher for smaller positive remainder)
    
    # This still makes perfect fit highest. If "almost full" means not perfectly full,
