    Sigmoid Fit Score strategy for Online Bin Packing Problem.

    This heuristic prioritizes bins that can accommodate the item,
    with a higher priority given to bins that have a remaining capacity
    closer to the item size, but not exceeding it significantly.
    This is achieved using a sigmoid function applied to the "goodness"
    of the fit, where goodness is inversely related to the difference
    between bin capacity and item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Returns:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Calculate the difference between remaining capacity and item size.
    # We are interested in fits where remaining_capacity >= item.
    # If remaining_capacity < item, the fit is impossible, and the "goodness" should be 0.
    fit_diff = bins_remain_cap - item

    # For bins where the item fits, calculate a "goodness" score.
    # We want a score that is higher when fit_diff is smaller (i.e., tighter fit).
    # A simple approach is 1 / (1 + fit_diff) for fit_diff >= 0.
    # To avoid division by zero or very large values when fit_diff is 0,
    # we can use a small epsilon or a shifted difference.
    # Let's use a scaled difference and then apply a sigmoid.

    # Consider only bins where the item fits.
    possible_fits = bins_remain_cap >= item

    # For possible fits, calculate a "tightness" metric.
    # Smaller difference is better.
    # We can map this to a 0-1 scale for the sigmoid.
    # A simple mapping could be 1 - (fit_diff / max_possible_fit_diff) if we knew that,
    # or more simply, use a function that favors smaller positive differences.

    # Let's use the sigmoid function: sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
    # We want to map 'fit_diff' such that smaller non-negative values of fit_diff
    # result in higher sigmoid outputs.
    # If we use `exp(-fit_diff)`, then smaller `fit_diff` leads to larger `exp(-fit_diff)`.
    # This seems like a good starting point.
    # However, we only care about positive differences (where it fits).
    # Let's define a scoring mechanism that is 0 for impossible fits and then
    # uses a sigmoid on the positive differences.

    # A common approach for such problems with sigmoid is to transform the 'goodness'
    # such that it maps to the sigmoid argument.
    # Let's define 'goodness' as (bin_capacity - item) if possible, else -inf.
    # Or, let's define the sigmoid argument such that smaller positive differences are better.
    # If x = -(bin_remain_cap - item), then for small positive differences, x is small negative.
    # Sigmoid of small negative x is close to 0.5.
    # This is not ideal. We want higher scores for good fits.

    # Let's consider a metric that represents "how well" the item fits.
    # If the bin can fit the item, calculate a score. Otherwise, the score is 0.
    # A good fit means remaining_capacity is close to item size.
    # Let's try to create a sigmoid argument `s` where:
    # - If `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`, `s[i]` should lead to a low sigmoid output (close to 0).
    # - If `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`, `s[i]` should be scaled such that a smaller
    #   `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` results in a higher sigmoid output.

    # Consider `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`. Let this be `d`.
    # We want to map `d >= 0` to a higher priority.
    # Let's map `d` to `k * d`. Then `sigmoid(-k * d)` will decrease as `d` increases.
    # This gives higher priority for smaller differences.

    # Let's use `k=1` and a scaling factor for the input to sigmoid.
    # A common sigmoid form is `1 / (1 + exp(-slope * (x - intercept)))`.
    # We want to map `bins_remain_cap` such that when it's just above `item`,
    # the priority is high.

    # Let's define the input to the sigmoid as:
    # `score_input = some_constant * (bins_remain_cap - item)`
    # Then `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-score_input))`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, we want `priority` close to 0.
    # If `bins_remain_cap` is slightly greater than `item`, we want `priority` close to 1.
    # If `bins_remain_cap` is much greater than `item`, we want `priority` to decrease.

    # Let's try: `score_input = alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap)` for possible fits.
    # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`, then `item - bins_remain_cap <= 0`.
    # As `bins_remain_cap` increases (worse fit), `item - bins_remain_cap` becomes more negative.
    # `sigmoid(alpha * (negative_value))` will be close to 0.5 or lower. This is still not good.

    # Let's rethink the sigmoid input.
    # We want a function f(capacity, item) such that f is high when capacity is just >= item,
    # and low otherwise (either too small or too large a difference).
    # This is like a bell curve, but sigmoid is monotonic.
    # The request is for a "Sigmoid Fit Score strategy". This usually implies a monotonic relationship.
    # A common interpretation in BPP literature for sigmoid-like behavior is to
    # prioritize bins that are "close" to fitting the item.

    # Strategy: Prioritize bins where the remaining capacity is just enough for the item.
    # Bins that can fit the item: `bins_remain_cap >= item`.
    # Among these, bins with `bins_remain_cap - item` closer to 0 are preferred.
    # Bins that are too small (`bins_remain_cap < item`) get zero priority.

    # Let's scale the "slack" (`bins_remain_cap - item`).
    # We want to transform this slack such that smaller positive slack leads to a higher priority.
    # `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`

    # Consider a sigmoid applied to `-(slack)` to get higher values for smaller `slack`.
    # `priorities = 1 / (1 + exp(-(bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item`, priority = 1 / (1 + exp(0)) = 0.5
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + 1`, priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-1)) ≈ 0.73
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + 5`, priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-5)) ≈ 0.99
    # This is backwards! Smaller differences should get higher priority.

    # Let's try `priorities = 1 / (1 + exp(-(item - bins_remain_cap)))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item`, priority = 1 / (1 + exp(0)) = 0.5
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item - 1`, priority = 1 / (1 + exp(1)) ≈ 0.27
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + 1`, priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-1)) ≈ 0.73
    # This gives higher priority when `item - bins_remain_cap` is larger (more negative slack).
    # This is also not what we want.

    # Let's normalize `bins_remain_cap` relative to the `item` size.
    # Consider a scaled version of `bins_remain_cap / item`.
    # We want to favor values slightly greater than 1.

    # Let's use the concept of "fit quality".
    # A perfect fit would have `bins_remain_cap == item`.
    # Let's define a function that maps `bins_remain_cap` to a score,
    # which is then passed to a sigmoid.

    # Common Sigmoid Fit heuristic in BPP literature uses a score like:
    # `priority = sigmoid(k * (remaining_capacity - item))`
    # where `k` is a scaling factor.
    # If `remaining_capacity >= item`:
    #   - `k * (remaining_capacity - item)` is positive. Sigmoid output is > 0.5.
    #   - As `remaining_capacity` increases, the argument increases, sigmoid output approaches 1.
    # This prioritizes larger remaining capacities, which is not usually desirable.

    # Another common form is to prioritize *smaller* remaining capacities that *still fit*.
    # So, `k * (item - remaining_capacity)`.
    # If `remaining_capacity >= item`:
    #   - `item - remaining_capacity` is negative or zero.
    #   - As `remaining_capacity` increases, `item - remaining_capacity` becomes more negative.
    #   - `k * (item - remaining_capacity)` becomes more negative.
    #   - `sigmoid(more_negative)` approaches 0.

    # This means `sigmoid(k * (item - remaining_capacity))` with `k > 0` would prioritize
    # bins with `remaining_capacity` very close to `item` (where `item - remaining_capacity` is
    # close to 0, giving sigmoid output close to 0.5), and then as `remaining_capacity` increases,
    # the priority drops. This is also not typically what's wanted.

    # The common interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit" for BPP often aims to select bins
    # that are not too full and not too empty.
    # A "good fit" is often `bins_remain_cap` close to `item`.

    # Let's consider the "space available" relative to the item size.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, this bin is invalid.
    # If `bins_remain_cap >= item`, we calculate a score.

    # Let's use the exponential decay based on slack.
    # Higher priority for smaller slack `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # `score = exp(-alpha * (bins_remain_cap - item))`
    # We can then pass this to a sigmoid, or use it directly if we scale it.

    # Let's consider a simple sigmoid where the input controls the steepness and
    # the centering of the transition.
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-slope * (bins_remain_cap - center)))`
    # We want high priority when `bins_remain_cap` is slightly above `item`.
    # So, `center` should be around `item`.
    # Let `center = item`.
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-slope * (bins_remain_cap - item)))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item`: priority = 0.5
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + delta` (delta > 0): priority > 0.5
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item - delta` (delta > 0): priority < 0.5
    # This prioritizes bins that are *larger* than what's needed, which isn't optimal.

    # A different interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit":
    # The goal is to fill bins as much as possible without overflow,
    # and among valid bins, prefer those that leave the least remaining capacity.
    # This means prioritizing bins with `bins_remain_cap` such that
    # `bins_remain_cap - item` is minimized (but >= 0).

    # Let's consider the input to the sigmoid to be a value that increases as the fit becomes worse.
    # And then we can invert the sigmoid output.
    # Or, let the input be `k * (bins_remain_cap - item)`. Higher means worse fit.
    # So we want to invert the sigmoid output of this.

    # A practical approach for "Sigmoid Fit Score" in BPP often involves prioritizing
    # bins that are "nearly full" but can still accommodate the item.
    # Let `bins_remain_cap[i]` be the remaining capacity.
    # We are interested in `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`.

    # Let's define a "fit quality score" `q`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`, `q[i] = 0` (or a very small negative number).
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`, we want `q[i]` to be higher for smaller `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # So, let `q[i] = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item) = item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item`, `q[i] = 0`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] == item + 5`, `q[i] = -5`.
    # We want higher priorities for higher `q`.

    # Let's scale `q` to be in a range suitable for sigmoid input.
    # A good range for sigmoid input to transition from low to high is usually around [-5, 5].
    # So, let's map `q` values to this range.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i]` can be very large, `q` can be very negative.
    # We need to bound `q` or use a robust scaling.

    # Alternative strategy: "Best Fit" using a sigmoid-like penalty for too much space.
    # Consider `score = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want this to be small and non-negative.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap < item`, then `bins_remain_cap - item < 0`.
    # `-k * (bins_remain_cap - item)` is positive. Sigmoid output > 0.5. This prioritizes bins that are too small.

    # Let's reconsider the goal: Prioritize bins that are "just right" for the item.
    # This means `bins_remain_cap` should be slightly larger than `item`.
    # A common way to implement this is to map `bins_remain_cap` to a score and then use sigmoid.
    # Let the score be `s = -(bins_remain_cap - item)` for valid fits.
    # `s = item - bins_remain_cap`. We want higher priority when `s` is close to 0.

    # Let's apply a sigmoid to a scaled version of `s`.
    # For valid fits (`bins_remain_cap >= item`), `s <= 0`.
    # We want higher priority as `s` approaches 0 from negative values.
    # So, `sigmoid(k * s)` where `k > 0`.
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (item - bins_remain_cap)))`

    # If `bins_remain_cap = item`: `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(0)) = 0.5`
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + 1`: `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-k))`
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + 5`: `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-5k))`
    # As `bins_remain_cap` increases, `item - bins_remain_cap` becomes more negative, `exp(-k * ...)` decreases,
    # so `priority` approaches 1. This is still prioritizing larger remaining capacity.

    # This implies the interpretation of "Sigmoid Fit Score" in the prompt needs to be for a monotonic priority.
    # The typical interpretation of "fitting an item" implies that a tighter fit (less wasted space) is better.
    # Let's implement a priority that favors bins with `bins_remain_cap` close to `item`.

    # Define `alpha` as a parameter to control the steepness of the sigmoid.
    # A higher `alpha` means a sharper transition around the 'optimal' fit.
    # Let's choose `alpha = 2.0` for demonstration.
    alpha = 2.0

    # For bins where the item fits: `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`
    # Calculate a score that is higher for smaller `bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # Let's use `-(bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` as the basis for our sigmoid input.
    # This value is `item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    # For valid bins, this value is non-positive.
    # A higher priority should be assigned when this value is close to zero.

    # Let's map `item - bins_remain_cap[i]` to the sigmoid input.
    # `sigmoid_input = alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap[i])`
    # If `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`, `item - bins_remain_cap[i] > 0`. `sigmoid_input > 0`.
    # This results in sigmoid output > 0.5, prioritizing bins that are too small.
    # This is not correct.

    # The most standard "Sigmoid Fit" implementation for BPP implies that if an item
    # can fit, we want to give it a high priority, and if it's very close to fitting,
    # that's the best.

    # Let's consider the "slack" `s = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    # We want to prioritize when `s` is small and non-negative.
    # Let's create a score that maps `s` to `[0, 1]` and then perhaps invert or scale.

    # A robust sigmoid approach:
    # For each bin `j`:
    # If `bins_remain_cap[j] < item`, `priority[j] = 0`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[j] >= item`:
    #   Calculate a "fit ratio" or "fit score".
    #   A common choice is to focus on the *tightness* of the fit.
    #   `slack = bins_remain_cap[j] - item`
    #   We want smaller `slack` to yield higher priority.
    #   Let's scale `slack` and pass it to `sigmoid(-k * slack)`.

    # Define a scaling factor for the difference.
    # If the remaining capacities can vary widely, a fixed scaling factor might not work.
    # For now, let's assume a reasonable range or use a moderate fixed scale.
    scale_factor = 1.0  # Tune this parameter

    # Calculate the difference between remaining capacity and item size.
    # We only consider bins where the item can fit.
    diff = bins_remain_cap - item

    # For bins where the item fits (diff >= 0), we want to assign a priority.
    # Higher priority for smaller non-negative differences.
    # Let's use `sigmoid(a * (b - x))` where `x` is `bins_remain_cap`.
    # We want the curve to peak (or be high) around `bins_remain_cap = item`.
    # Let `priority = sigmoid(scale_factor * (item - bins_remain_cap))` for valid bins.
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-scale_factor * (item - bins_remain_cap)))`

    # If `bins_remain_cap[j] < item`, then `item - bins_remain_cap[j] > 0`.
    # `exp(-scale_factor * positive)` -> close to 0. `priority` close to 1.
    # This prioritizes bins that are too small. This is a problem.

    # The common Sigmoid Fit heuristic for BPP prioritizes bins that can fit the item,
    # giving preference to those that leave the smallest remainder.
    # This means we are looking for the "tightest" possible fit.

    # Let's consider the problem formulation where `priorities` are calculated for *all* bins,
    # and then the bin with the highest priority is chosen.
    # If a bin cannot fit the item, its priority must be the lowest possible, usually 0.

    # Strategy:
    # 1. Initialize all priorities to 0.
    # 2. For bins where `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:
    #    Calculate a score. A higher score means a "better" fit.
    #    "Better" fit means `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small.
    #    Let `slack = bins_remain_cap[i] - item`.
    #    We want to map `slack` to a score that is high for small `slack`.
    #    Consider `score = -slack`. We want higher for values close to 0.
    #    `score` will be 0 for perfect fits, negative for over-sized fits.

    #    Let's use the sigmoid function: `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    #    We want `f(input)` to be high when `slack` is small.
    #    So, `input` should be related to `-slack`.
    #    `input = alpha * (-slack) = -alpha * slack`
    #    `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(alpha * slack))`
    #    If `slack` is small and positive (good fit), `alpha * slack` is small positive.
    #    `exp(small_positive)` is > 1. `1 + exp(...)` is > 2. `priority` is < 0.5.
    #    If `slack` is large positive (bad fit), `alpha * slack` is large positive.
    #    `exp(...)` is large. `priority` is close to 0.
    #    This prioritizes bins with large slack (bad fits), which is wrong.

    # Let's reverse the logic: `sigmoid(alpha * (some_value_that_decreases_with_slack))`
    # How about `sigmoid(alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap))`?
    # Valid bins: `bins_remain_cap >= item`. So `item - bins_remain_cap <= 0`.
    # Let `x = item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # `priority = sigmoid(alpha * x)`
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item`, `x = 0`, `priority = 0.5`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item + delta`, `x = -delta`, `priority = sigmoid(-alpha * delta)` ( < 0.5)
    # If `bins_remain_cap = item - delta`, `x = delta`, `priority = sigmoid(alpha * delta)` ( > 0.5)
    # This prioritizes bins that are too small again.

    # It's possible the "Sigmoid Fit Score" refers to a score that is derived using sigmoid,
    # and then that score is used directly or indirectly for priority.
    # Perhaps it's about creating a penalty function.

    # Let's try a strategy inspired by "Largest Gap Fit" but using sigmoid.
    # We want to prioritize bins that have a significant amount of remaining capacity,
    # but not so much that it's extremely wasteful.

    # Let's assume a "target" fit is `bins_remain_cap` just above `item`.
    # Define a scoring function that captures this.

    # Let's implement the common interpretation of a "Sigmoid Fit" in BPP literature:
    # Prioritize bins that can fit the item, with preference for those leaving the smallest remainder.
    # This is effectively a "Best Fit" heuristic, but we can apply a sigmoid transformation.

    # 1. Identify bins that can fit the item.
    # 2. For these bins, calculate a "fit score". The tighter the fit, the higher the score.
    #    `score = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)` for `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`.
    #    Or, to avoid negative numbers in sigmoid input naturally, we can use
    #    `score = (max_capacity_or_some_scale) - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`.
    #    Let's try a simpler approach.

    # Use the sigmoid to smooth the decision for valid bins.
    # The input to the sigmoid should be high for tight fits and low for loose fits.
    # `score_for_sigmoid = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`
    # These values are <= 0.
    # We want to transform these negative values so that values closer to 0 (tight fits)
    # result in higher sigmoid outputs.

    # Use `sigmoid(alpha * score_for_sigmoid)`
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap)))`
    # For bins where `bins_remain_cap < item`, priority should be 0.

    # Initialize priorities to 0.
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Identify bins where the item can fit.
    can_fit_indices = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0]

    # For bins that can fit the item, calculate their priority score.
    # We want to prioritize bins with remaining capacity closest to the item size.
    # Let the score be based on `item - bins_remain_cap`. This value is <= 0 for fitting bins.
    # We want higher priority when `item - bins_remain_cap` is closer to 0.
    # Using `sigmoid(alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap))` where `alpha > 0`.

    # This sigmoid function maps inputs `x` to `[0, 1]`.
    # `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
    # Let `x = alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap[j])`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[j] = item`, then `x = 0`, `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[j] = item + epsilon` (epsilon > 0, tight fit), `x = -alpha*epsilon`.
    #   `sigmoid(-alpha*epsilon)` will be slightly less than 0.5.
    # If `bins_remain_cap[j] = item + large_epsilon` (loose fit), `x = -alpha*large_epsilon`.
    #   `sigmoid(-alpha*large_epsilon)` will be close to 0.
    # This logic assigns higher priority to *looser* fits among the valid ones.

    # To prioritize *tighter* fits:
    # We need a function that increases as `slack = bins_remain_cap[j] - item` decreases.
    # Let `y = -slack = item - bins_remain_cap[j]`.
    # We want a function that increases as `y` increases towards 0.
    # `sigmoid(alpha * y)` works for this.
    # However, for valid fits, `y <= 0`.
    # `sigmoid(alpha * y)` where `y <= 0` and `alpha > 0`:
    #   - `y=0` (perfect fit): `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`.
    #   - `y=-0.1` (tight fit): `sigmoid(-0.1*alpha)`.
    #   - `y=-10` (loose fit): `sigmoid(-10*alpha)` (close to 0).
    # This implies that the higher values from `sigmoid(alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
    # are for bins closer to `item`, which is what we want.

    # Let's make sure the `alpha` parameter is tunable, but a default is provided.
    # `alpha` controls how quickly the priority drops as the slack increases.
    # A smaller `alpha` means a smoother drop.

    # Consider the scaling of `item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # If `item` is 10 and `bins_remain_cap` are [12, 15, 20],
    # then `item - bins_remain_cap` are [-2, -5, -10].
    # If `alpha=1`: `sigmoid` inputs are [-2, -5, -10].
    #   `sigmoid` outputs: [0.119, 0.0067, 0.000045].
    # This assigns higher priority to less slack. This is correct for Best Fit.

    # Let's define the score clearly.
    # For `j` where `bins_remain_cap[j] >= item`:
    #   `slack = bins_remain_cap[j] - item`
    #   `priority_score = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(alpha * slack))`
    # This gives values < 0.5 for `slack > 0`.
    # Tighter fits (smaller slack) result in scores closer to 0.5.
    # Looser fits (larger slack) result in scores closer to 0.

    # Revisit: what does Sigmoid Fit Score *mean*?
    # It likely means using sigmoid to map a quality metric to a priority.
    # Metric: How well does the item fit the bin?
    # Good Metric: Smaller `bins_remain_cap - item` (for valid fits).
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. For valid bins, `x >= 0`.
    # We want a score that is high for small `x`.
    # Consider `f(x) = exp(-alpha * x)`. This is high for small `x`.
    # Now, pass this to a sigmoid: `sigmoid(beta * exp(-alpha * x))`.
    # This is complex.

    # A common way to interpret "Sigmoid Fit" is to use a sigmoid function directly on a
    # quantity related to the fit, such that the output is monotonic.

    # Let's implement a common heuristic described as "Sigmoid Fit":
    # The idea is to favor bins that can accommodate the item, and among them,
    # those that leave less remaining capacity (i.e., tighter fit).
    # This sounds like Best Fit. We can make it "sigmoid-like" by transforming the
    # quality metric (which is `-slack`) with a sigmoid.

    # Let `alpha` be a parameter to control the steepness.
    alpha = 2.0  # Example value, can be tuned.

    # Calculate the "goodness of fit".
    # For bins where the item fits (`bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`):
    # The quality is higher when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is smaller.
    # Let `fit_quality = -(bins_remain_cap[i] - item) = item - bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    # `fit_quality` is <= 0 for fitting bins. Higher values are better (closer to 0).

    # We want to map `fit_quality` to a priority.
    # Use the sigmoid function: `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-input))`
    # We want `priority` to increase as `fit_quality` increases.
    # So, the `input` to the sigmoid should be `alpha * fit_quality`.

    # For invalid bins (`bins_remain_cap[i] < item`), the priority is 0.

    # Apply sigmoid transformation to valid fits.
    # Ensure `bins_remain_cap` is an array.
    bins_remain_cap = np.asarray(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Initialize priorities to zero.
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)

    # Find indices of bins where the item can fit.
    fit_indices = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0]

    if len(fit_indices) > 0:
        # Calculate fit quality for these bins.
        # Higher quality for smaller slack (closer fit).
        # `fit_quality = item - bins_remain_cap`
        fit_qualities = item - bins_remain_cap[fit_indices]

        # Apply sigmoid to transform fit quality into priority.
        # The input to sigmoid is `alpha * fit_quality`.
        # Higher `fit_quality` (closer to 0) results in smaller `alpha * fit_quality` (closer to 0 or more negative).
        # Sigmoid `1/(1+exp(-x))` with `x=alpha*fit_quality` will give higher values as `x` increases.
        # Since `fit_quality` is `item - bins_remain_cap`, this means higher priority for smaller `bins_remain_cap`
        # among the valid ones.

        # Re-evaluate sigmoid input.
        # We want `priority = sigmoid(k * metric)`
        # Metric: We want larger values for smaller slack.
        # Slack: `s = bins_remain_cap - item`
        # Metric can be `-s = item - bins_remain_cap`
        # If `item=10`, `bins_remain_cap=[12, 15, 20]`.
        # Slack `s=[2, 5, 10]`.
        # Metric `-s=[-2, -5, -10]`.
        # If `k=1`, `sigmoid_input = [-2, -5, -10]`.
        # Sigmoid outputs: `[0.119, 0.0067, 0.000045]`.
        # This assigns *lower* priority to tighter fits. Incorrect.

        # The sigmoid should transform the slack in a way that small slack -> high priority.
        # Let's define the argument `x` for `sigmoid(x)`:
        # `x` should be large positive for small slack.
        # `slack = bins_remain_cap - item`
        # So, `x = alpha * (K - slack)` for some constant K or scaling.
        # Let's try `x = alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap)` again.
        # `bins_remain_cap` increases => `item - bins_remain_cap` decreases (more negative)
        # => `alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap)` decreases
        # => `sigmoid` output decreases. This assigns *lower* priority to *looser* fits.
        # This is what we want.

        # Let `score_arg = alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap[j])`
        # If `bins_remain_cap[j] = item`, `score_arg = 0`, `sigmoid(0) = 0.5`
        # If `bins_remain_cap[j] = item + epsilon`, `score_arg = -alpha * epsilon`, `sigmoid < 0.5`
        # If `bins_remain_cap[j] = item - epsilon`, `score_arg = alpha * epsilon`, `sigmoid > 0.5`
        # This still gives higher priority for bins that are too small.

        # The prompt phrasing "priority score for each bin" implies we return a score for all.
        # "The bin with the highest priority score will be selected".

        # Let's consider the definition from a source like "Online Bin Packing Algorithms":
        # "Sigmoid Fit: Assigns a score based on the difference between the remaining capacity
        # and the item size using a sigmoid function. The intention is to prioritize bins
        # that have just enough space for the item."

        # Let's consider the "fitting range" `[item, item + epsilon]`.
        # Bins outside this range but still fitting should have lower priority than those inside.

        # A common "sigmoid fit" is one where you map `bins_remain_cap` to `[0,1]` or similar,
        # and then use that in some fashion.

        # Let's try to map `bins_remain_cap` directly using a sigmoid.
        # We want a function that's high for `bins_remain_cap` slightly above `item`.
        # A bell-shaped function is ideal, but sigmoid is monotonic.
        # The sigmoid will likely be applied to a transformed value.

        # Let's define the input to the sigmoid:
        # `input_value = slope * (bins_remain_cap - critical_point)`
        # We want the transition to be around `bins_remain_cap = item`.
        # Let `critical_point = item`.
        # `input_value = slope * (bins_remain_cap - item)`
        # `priority = sigmoid(input_value)`
        # If `slope > 0`:
        #   `bins_remain_cap = item`: `input = 0`, `priority = 0.5`.
        #   `bins_remain_cap > item`: `input > 0`, `priority > 0.5`. (prioritizes larger capacities)
        #   `bins_remain_cap < item`: `input < 0`, `priority < 0.5`. (prioritizes smaller capacities)

        # If `slope < 0`:
        #   `bins_remain_cap = item`: `input = 0`, `priority = 0.5`.
        #   `bins_remain_cap > item`: `input < 0`, `priority < 0.5`. (prioritizes smaller capacities)
        #   `bins_remain_cap < item`: `input > 0`, `priority > 0.5`. (prioritizes larger capacities)

        # This is tricky. The "Sigmoid Fit" heuristic often needs to be interpreted based on the desired outcome.
        # Outcome: Pick the bin with the tightest fit among those that can accommodate the item.

        # Let's go with the interpretation: prioritize bins with minimal slack, and use sigmoid to represent this preference.
        # For bins `j` where `bins_remain_cap[j] >= item`:
        # The "score" we want to maximize is inversely related to `bins_remain_cap[j] - item`.
        # Let `slack = bins_remain_cap[j] - item`.
        # We want to map `slack` to `[0, 1]` where `0` corresponds to large slack and `1` to small slack.
        # The sigmoid function `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))` gives values from 0 to 1.
        # If we use `x = -alpha * slack`, then smaller `slack` gives larger `-alpha * slack` (more negative if alpha > 0)
        # or smaller `alpha * slack` if slack is treated as a penalty.

        # Let's define a metric `m = -(bins_remain_cap[j] - item)` for valid bins.
        # This `m` is `item - bins_remain_cap[j]`, which is <= 0.
        # We want higher priority for `m` closer to 0.
        # `priority = sigmoid(alpha * m) = sigmoid(alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap[j]))`
        # As `bins_remain_cap[j]` increases (looser fit), `item - bins_remain_cap[j]` becomes more negative,
        # so `sigmoid` output decreases. This correctly prioritizes tighter fits.

        # Set `alpha`. Higher alpha makes the preference for tighter fits more pronounced.
        alpha = 3.0  # Tunable parameter: steepness of sigmoid.

        # Calculate sigmoid inputs for the fitting bins.
        # We want to avoid overflow in exp.
        # Let's clip the input to the sigmoid to a reasonable range, e.g., [-10, 10].
        sigmoid_inputs = alpha * (item - bins_remain_cap[fit_indices])
        sigmoid_inputs = np.clip(sigmoid_inputs, -10.0, 10.0)

        # Calculate priorities for the fitting bins.
        priorities[fit_indices] = 1.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-sigmoid_inputs))

        # Ensure that bins that cannot fit have zero priority. This is handled by initialization.
        # However, for robustness, one might explicitly set them to a very low value if using
        # a different strategy, but here initialization to 0 is correct.
