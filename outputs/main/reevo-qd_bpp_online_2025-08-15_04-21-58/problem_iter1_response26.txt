    """
    Sigmoid Fit Score strategy for Online Bin Packing.

    This priority function assigns a higher priority to bins that are a "good fit"
    for the item. A "good fit" is defined as a bin where the remaining capacity
    is slightly larger than the item's size. The sigmoid function is used to
    smoothly transition from low priority (for very large or very small remaining
    capacities) to high priority (for near-perfect fits).

    Args:
        item: Size of the item to be packed.
        bins_remain_cap: A NumPy array representing the remaining capacity of each bin.

    Returns:
        A NumPy array of the same size as bins_remain_cap, where each element
        represents the priority score for placing the item in the corresponding bin.
        Higher scores indicate a higher priority.

    # Apply a sigmoid function. We want the "peak" of the sigmoid to be at a
    # remaining capacity that is slightly larger than the item size (to allow
    # for some remaining space, which might be beneficial in some BPP variants
    # or for future items). A common heuristic is to aim for a remaining capacity
    # of item_size + some_small_margin, or simply item_size itself for a strict fit.
    # For simplicity and a common "best fit" heuristic, we'll aim for remaining_capacity = item_size.
    # This means we want diffs to be 0.
    # The sigmoid function will be centered around 0 difference.
    # To make it a priority, we want higher values for better fits.
    # We can use a sigmoid centered at 0.

    # Parameters for the sigmoid:
    # The steepness (k) controls how quickly the priority changes around the center.
    # A steeper sigmoid will be more selective for near-perfect fits.
    k = 2.0  # Steepness factor. Adjust this based on desired selectivity.

    # Shift the sigmoid so that a difference of 0 (perfect fit) gives a score around 0.5
    # then we can scale and shift it to have peak priority.
    # A common sigmoid is 1 / (1 + exp(-k*x)).
    # We want higher priority for smaller non-negative diffs.
    # Let's use a sigmoid where a diff of 0 gives the highest score.
    # We can map diffs to -inf to +inf and then apply sigmoid.
    # Let's shift the values so that the "best fit" (diff=0) is at the center of the sigmoid.
    # The sigmoid f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*x)) has an inflection point at x=0.
    # We want diff=0 to be the maximum. If we want the sigmoid to increase as diff decreases,
    # we can use exp(k*x) or adjust the centering.

    # Let's consider the "value" of a fit as 1/(1 + diff) if diff >= 0.
    # This is not sigmoid.

    # Using sigmoid: we want the sigmoid to peak when diff is minimal (but >= 0).
    # If we use `sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*x))`, this increases with x.
    # We want it to increase as `diff` decreases. So we use `sigmoid(-diff)`.
    
    # Calculate priorities for valid bins
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)
    
    # Apply sigmoid to the differences of valid bins
    # Sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*x))
    # We want higher priority when diff is smaller. So we can use Sigmoid(-diff)
    # or 1 - Sigmoid(diff). Let's use 1 - Sigmoid(diff) to map diff=0 to 1.
    # 1 - (1 / (1 + exp(-k*diff))) = exp(-k*diff) / (1 + exp(-k*diff))
    # This is essentially a logistic function shifted.

    # A simpler sigmoid mapping: scale diff to a range, then apply sigmoid.
    # Or, use a sigmoid that's naturally decreasing or has its peak at 0.
    # Let's use a sigmoid where the peak is at diff = 0.
    # `priorities_for_valid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * fit_scores))`
    # This maps diff=0 to 0.5, diff>0 to <0.5, diff<0 to >0.5.
    # This isn't quite right.

    # Let's try a shifted sigmoid that gives peak at diff = 0.
    # sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) -> increases from 0 to 1.
    # We want a function that peaks at diff=0 and decreases.
    # Consider a Gaussian-like shape or a bell curve. Sigmoid isn't ideal for a peak.

    # Re-interpreting Sigmoid Fit Score:
    # Often, "sigmoid fit" implies mapping a "goodness" score to a priority,
    # where the goodness score itself might be derived.
    # A common heuristic is the "best fit" rule: choose the bin with the smallest remaining capacity
    # that is still greater than or equal to the item's size.
    # The sigmoid fit could be a way to quantify this "best fit" desirability.

    # Let's define "fit quality" for valid bins. A perfect fit has `diff = 0`.
    # As `diff` increases, the fit quality decreases.
    # We want a priority function that increases as fit quality increases.

    # Consider `fit_score = -diff` for valid bins.
    # Then apply sigmoid to this: `sigmoid(k * (-diff)) = 1 / (1 + exp(k * diff))`
    # This maps `diff=0` to `0.5`, `diff>0` to `<0.5`, `diff<0` (impossible if valid_bins_mask works) to `>0.5`.
    # This means bins with smaller remaining capacity are prioritized, which is "best fit".

    # Let's use `priorities_for_valid = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * fit_scores))`
    # The output of this is between 0 and 1.

    priorities[valid_bins_mask] = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * fit_scores))

    # We want to ensure that bins that cannot fit the item have zero priority.
    # This is handled by initializing `priorities` to zeros and only updating valid ones.
    
    # An alternative interpretation: maximize the remaining capacity after packing,
    # but subject to a "fit" criterion.
    # This sigmoid strategy is often used to give a smoother preference than hard rules.

    # Let's try another approach: aim for a target remaining capacity `T`.
    # A perfect fit is `bins_remain_cap = item`. So `diff = 0`.
    # The priority should be highest when `bins_remain_cap` is closest to `item`.
    # `priority ~ 1 / (1 + |bins_remain_cap - item|)` is not sigmoid.

    # Let's go back to `1 / (1 + exp(-k*x))`. We want this to be high when `diff` is small and non-negative.
    # If we use `x = C - diff` for some constant C, and want the peak at `diff = 0`, then `x = C`.
    # So `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (C - diff)))`.
    # If we want peak at diff=0, then `C=0`. `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(k * diff))`.
    # This decreases as diff increases, which is what "best fit" wants.

    # To make the scores higher for better fits (smaller diff), we can use:
    # `scaled_diff = diff / max_diff` (or some other scaling)
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * scaled_diff))`

    # Let's refine `priority_v2` to use the interpretation:
    # Priority is high for bins where `bins_remain_cap` is just slightly larger than `item`.
    # We want to favor bins with `bins_remain_cap - item = 0` or very small positive values.
    
    # Consider the difference `bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # For bins where this is negative, the priority is 0.
    # For bins where this is non-negative, we apply the sigmoid.
    # Let `x = bins_remain_cap - item`. We want a function that is high for `x` close to 0.
    # `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-k*x))` increases with `x`. We want it to decrease as `x` increases from 0.
    # So, let's use `f(-x) = 1 / (1 + exp(k*x))`. This decreases from 1 (at x=0) towards 0.

    # Apply this only to bins that can fit the item.
    priorities_for_valid_bins = np.zeros(np.sum(valid_bins_mask))
    
    # Avoid potential `inf` in exp if `k*fit_scores` becomes very large negative
    # (e.g., if `fit_scores` is negative, which it shouldn't be with `valid_bins_mask`,
    # but numerical stability is key).
    # `np.exp(k * fit_scores)` for positive `k` and `fit_scores` will result in values >= 1.
    # The `1 / (1 + exp(k * fit_scores))` will be <= 0.5.
    # The peak priority will be at `diff=0` where it's `1 / (1 + exp(0)) = 0.5`.

    # To make it truly a priority, maybe we want the scores to range up to 1.
    # We can scale the output: `2 * (1 / (1 + np.exp(k * fit_scores)))` if we want it to range up to 1.
    # Or `10 * (1 / (1 + np.exp(k * fit_scores)))` to have a wider range.
    
    # Let's refine the sigmoid to map `diff=0` to a higher priority (e.g., 1) and
    # larger diff to lower priority.
    # Consider a Gaussian-like function for priority, centered at `diff=0`.
    # `priority = exp(- (k * diff)**2 / 2)` for valid bins.
    # This is not a sigmoid, but captures the "fit" idea well.

    # If sticking strictly to a sigmoid:
    # Use `priority = exp(k * diff)` transformed by a reciprocal or subtraction.
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (TARGET_DIFF - diff)))`
    # If TARGET_DIFF is slightly positive, say `epsilon`.
    # `priority = 1 / (1 + exp(-k * (epsilon - diff)))`
    # When `diff = epsilon`, priority is `0.5`.
    # When `diff = 0`, priority is `1 / (1 + exp(-k*epsilon))`.
    # When `diff` is large positive, priority approaches `1 / (1 + exp(-inf)) = 1`.
    # This prioritizes bins with *more* remaining capacity, which is not "best fit".

    # Let's use a sigmoid where the input is `item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # Let `x = item - bins_remain_cap`.
    # Valid bins have `bins_remain_cap >= item`, so `x <= 0`.
    # We want high priority when `x` is close to 0.
    # Use `sigmoid(k * x)` where `sigmoid(y) = 1 / (1 + exp(-y))`.
    # This increases as `x` increases. Since `x` is <= 0, it increases as `item - bins_remain_cap` increases.
    # This means it increases as `bins_remain_cap` decreases. This is "best fit".
    # The output ranges from 0 to 0.5 (since x <= 0).

    # To get priorities up to 1, we can do `2 * sigmoid(k*x)` for valid bins.
    # Or simply `sigmoid(k*x)` is fine if relative priorities matter.
    # Let's use `1 - sigmoid(-k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` to have peak at 0.
    # `1 - (1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))))`
    # Let `diff = bins_remain_cap - item`.
    # `1 - (1 / (1 + exp(k * diff))) = exp(k * diff) / (1 + exp(k * diff))`
    # This is `sigmoid(k*diff)`.
    # So priority is `sigmoid(k * (bins_remain_cap - item))` for valid bins.

        # `exp(0) = 1`. Min value of `x_values` can be `item - max_bin_capacity`.
        # If `max_bin_capacity` is small, `x_values` can be largely positive, leading to `exp(large positive)`.
        # Let's use `sigmoid(k*x)` directly as `1 / (1 + exp(-k*x))`.
        # x = item - bin_cap. For valid bins, bin_cap >= item, so x <= 0.

        # Highest value is 0.5 when `y=0` (i.e., `item == bins_remain_cap`).

        # To ensure a range up to 1 and that 0.5 is not the max for good fits:
        # We can add an offset or scale.
        # For example, `priority = 0.5 + 0.5 * sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap))`
        # This shifts the range from [0, 0.5] to [0.5, 1].
        # The peak priority of 1 is achieved when `item - bins_remain_cap == 0`.
