Prioritize tight fits (Best Fit), especially near-perfect ones, to minimize fragmentation, using non-linear scoring.
Combine 'best fit' criteria (tightness) with 'current bin utilization' to improve packing efficiency and reduce bin count.
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity. Reward tight and near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Strategically evaluate item fit, prioritizing snug placements to preserve larger bin capacities for future items.
Prioritize future bin utilization (Best Fit) and current bin fullness to minimize bin count.
Utilize all available information to create tiered priorities that optimize bin utilization, e.g., prioritizing perfect fits.
Design heuristics to aggressively prioritize tight fits, maximizing bin utilization and minimizing fragmentation.
Reward minimal remaining capacity, especially with non-linear incentives for near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize bins based on expected remaining capacity, strongly favoring tight fits to minimize fragmentation.
Prioritize tight fits with non-linear rewards to minimize fragmentation and maximize bin utilization.
