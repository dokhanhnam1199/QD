    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using a Best Fit-like strategy,
    aggressively rewarding perfect and near-perfect fits.

    This strategy aims to leave the smallest possible remaining capacity in a bin after placing the item,
    thereby 'snugly' fitting items and preserving larger empty spaces in other bins for future larger items.
    It applies a stronger non-linear penalty for larger remaining capacities compared to v1,
    making perfect/near-perfect fits much more desirable.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Bins that cannot fit the item will have a priority score of 0.
        For bins that can fit, a higher score indicates a 'tighter' fit (smaller remaining capacity).
