Combine best fit (future state) with current bin utilization, weighted, to minimize bins used.
Prioritize minimizing remaining bin capacity. Strongly favor near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation and bin count.
Leverage item and bin data for strategic fits. Prioritize snugness, preserving larger capacities.
Implement strategies utilizing item/bin properties to intelligently prioritize beneficial fits.
Prioritize minimizing remaining capacity; strongly reward near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation and improve density.
Prioritize tight fits, minimize remaining capacity, and reward near-perfect fills to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize best fit. Amplify non-linear rewards for minimal remaining capacity, especially near-perfect fits, to reduce fragmentation.
Minimize remaining capacity; reward near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize specific outcomes (e.g., perfect fits) and minimize waste through tiered greedy scoring.
Quantify outcome desirability (e.g., tight fit). Apply non-linear scoring to strongly reward best choices.
