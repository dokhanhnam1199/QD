    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using an enhanced Best Fit strategy.

    This strategy aims to strongly prioritize near-perfect fits to minimize fragmentation and maximize
    the utilization of existing bins. It uses a non-linear inverse reward function to aggressively
    favor bins that result in very small remaining capacity after placing the item. The
    aggressiveness of this preference can be tuned via the 'non_linear_power' parameter.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin. Must be a non-negative float.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin. Must contain non-negative floats.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Bins that cannot fit the item will have a priority score of 0.
        For bins that can fit, a higher score indicates a 'tighter' fit (smaller remaining capacity),
        with a strong emphasis on very tight fits, controlled by the power.
