Always ensure fit; prioritize by remaining capacity; reward perfect/near-perfect fits strongly.
Prioritize tight fits (Best Fit) and existing bins to improve utilization and reduce total bins.
Focus on minimizing remaining capacity. Reward perfect and near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize tight fits, especially near-perfect ones, using non-linear scoring to minimize fragmentation.
Utilize item and bin data. Combine tight-fit (Best Fit) with strategies for filling existing bins.
Minimize remaining capacity, especially rewarding near-perfect fits with non-linear scoring to reduce fragmentation.
Combine principles: best fit for items and maximize existing bin utilization.
Prioritize minimal remaining space; aggressively reward near-perfect fits via non-linear penalties to combat fragmentation.
Intelligently prioritize bins using item size and remaining capacity to optimize space usage.
Prioritize based on resulting bin capacity; reward near-perfect fits non-linearly to minimize fragmentation.
