Prioritize tight fits and incentivize minimal remaining capacity to reduce fragmentation, often via non-linear scoring.
Leverage item and bin data. Apply strategic fit criteria (e.g., Best Fit) to optimize packing.
Utilize problem data (item size, bin capacity) to guide selection, e.g., Best Fit, optimizing space.
Prioritize bins for tighter fits using item size and remaining capacity.
Utilize item and bin data to make strategic choices. Prioritize tight fits to optimize space utilization.
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity (Best Fit). Reward near-perfect fits to maximize bin utilization and reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize by minimizing post-insertion remaining capacity; favor near-perfect fits to efficiently 'close' bins.
Combine strategies: prioritize tight fits and maximize existing bin utilization.
Prioritize bins based on an effective fit metric, not arbitrary choice, to optimize space utilization.
Prioritize tight fits and filling existing bins to minimize open bins.
