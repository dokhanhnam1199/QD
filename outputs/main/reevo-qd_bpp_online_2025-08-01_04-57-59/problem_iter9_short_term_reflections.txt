Prioritize by minimizing remaining capacity. Non-linearly reward near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation and improve packing density.
Use item and bin data to prioritize choices; aim for strategic outcomes like snug fits and space efficiency.
Prioritize bins for best fit and current utilization to optimize packing density and minimize bin count.
Prioritize snug fits (Best Fit) and existing bins to optimize space utilization.
Prioritize bins that best fit new items and those already started. Use weighted combinations of criteria.
Evaluate item-bin fit. Prioritize minimal remaining capacity, especially near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Focus on tight fits and encourage filling existing bins.
Minimize fragmentation. Prioritize tight fits via non-linear scoring, using thresholds to differentiate fit quality.
Implement greedy best-fit logic, biased towards completing existing bins.
Prefer tighter fits (Best Fit); heavily reward near-perfect fits to minimize fragmentation and close bins.
