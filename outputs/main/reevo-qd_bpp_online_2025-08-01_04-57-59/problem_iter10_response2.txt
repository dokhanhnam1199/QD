    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin,
    using a strategy that combines Best Fit with a strong preference for filling
    already-started bins, aiming for further improved overall bin utilization.

    This strategy refines the combination of 'tightest fit' and 'current bin fill level'
    by making the fill level *amplify* the tightness score. This means that a bin
    that is already well-utilized will have its "best fit" score boosted, encouraging
    the completion of existing bins, thereby promoting a more compact solution and
    reducing the total number of bins used.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
        Bins that cannot fit the item will have a priority score of 0.
        For bins that can fit, a higher score indicates a 'tighter' fit,
        significantly amplified by the bin's current (pre-placement) fill level.

    # tight fits. A bin that is half-full will have its best-fit score multiplied by 1.5,

    # significant factor than in a simple additive combination.
