Prioritize tightest fits, especially near-perfect ones, to minimize remaining capacity and prevent fragmentation.
Prioritize tight fits and favor already-used bins for better utilization.
Combine tight-fit and bin-utilization logic for improved packing density.
Prioritize Best Fit (maximizing post-placement fill) and maximize utilization of existing bins.
Filter invalid options. Greedily minimize remaining capacity, applying non-linear rewards for near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Maximize bin fill (Best Fit) and prioritize completing existing bins.
Leverage problem-specific information (item/bin sizes) to make strategic, non-arbitrary placement decisions.
Prioritize bins that minimize remaining capacity, especially near-perfect fits, to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize bins based on their *potential remaining capacity* to optimize future item placements and minimize fragmentation.
Ensure feasibility. Prioritize minimizing remaining space, especially for tight fits, to reduce fragmentation.
