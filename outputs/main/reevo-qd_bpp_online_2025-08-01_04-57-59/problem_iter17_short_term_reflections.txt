Leverage item and bin state. Prioritize snug fits and fuller bins using weighted, non-linear criteria for selection.
Weighted combination of tight fit and bin fullness for efficient closure.
Prioritize tight fits using non-linear rewards to minimize fragmentation and maximize bin utilization.
Prioritize tight fits and full bin utilization for better performance.
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity and aggressively reward near-perfect fits to reduce fragmentation.
Prioritize strategic fit and bin utilization using weighted, non-linear scores for better performance.
Leverage problem data for informed choices. Prioritize best fits, strongly rewarding near-perfect ones to minimize fragmentation.
Assign differentiated scores based on strategic goals like minimizing remaining capacity and prioritizing perfect fits.
Prioritize tightest fits and consolidate items into existing bins.
Define specific objectives (e.g., best fit, bin fullness). Combine them via weighted, non-linear scoring.
