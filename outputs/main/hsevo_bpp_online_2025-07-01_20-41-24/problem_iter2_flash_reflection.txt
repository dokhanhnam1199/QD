**Analysis:**

*   **Comparing (1st) vs (20th),** the best heuristic uses an exponential function to prioritize partially filled bins, giving a capped boost based on remaining space relative to the total capacity, and a hard penalty for bins that cannot fit the item. The worst heuristic uses a fill ratio and quadratic penalty, normalizing the penalty by the maximum bin capacity. The first one focuses on efficient fitting using relative space, while the last attempts to balance fill ratio and a penalty, but may over-penalize.

*   **Comparing (2nd) vs (19th),** the second best heuristic uses a combination of heuristics, including minimizing remaining space, prioritizing initially full bins, and slightly preferring bins just big enough. The 19th (duplicate of 18th), calculates a "fit" score, a normalized "fullness" score, and a "rarity" score based on exponential decay. The second best balances multiple factors with heuristics while the 19th normalizes remain capacity to calculate fullness.

*   **Comparing (3rd) vs (4th),** the 3rd prioritizes bins where the item fits with a combined `cap*item / (remaining_space + 1e-9)` score and uses a simple negative value for bins that cannot fit. The 4th prioritizes bins based on fill ratio, adds a bonus for almost full bins after item addition, introduces a fragmentation penalty, and inverts remaining capacity scaled by item size. The 3rd is simpler but less nuanced than the 4th, which incorporates more factors.

*   **Comparing (second worst) vs (worst),** the second worst heuristic (19th), which calculates a "fit" score, a normalized "fullness" score, and a "rarity" score based on exponential decay, heavily penalizing bins where the item doesn't fit. The worst heuristic (20th),uses a fill ratio and quadratic penalty, normalizing the penalty by the maximum bin capacity. The 19th uses a combination of scores whereas the last one uses ratio and penalty functions.

*   **Overall:** The better heuristics use a combination of strategies like prioritizing almost full bins, penalizing waste, and considering the initial capacity of the bins. They often involve exponential functions or ratios to create a nuanced priority score. The worse heuristics tend to rely on simpler calculations or penalties that may not effectively balance the various factors involved in bin packing. Normalization plays a crucial role in several heuristics. Also, several heuristics are repeated (e.g., 6th and 4th, 10th and 9th, 19th and 18th).

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics for bin packing, consider a multifaceted approach that combines filling efficiency, waste reduction, and initial capacity. Use exponential functions and ratios to create nuanced priority scores and consider normalization. Prioritize near-full bins and penalize significant waste.
