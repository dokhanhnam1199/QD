Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Avoid division by zero and negative values in log.\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n      return np.full_like(bins_remain_cap, -np.inf)  # No valid bins\n\n    # Calculate the waste if the item is placed in each bin.\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    waste[waste < 0] = np.inf #invalid bins\n\n    # Give high priority to bins that can fit the item without much waste.\n    priority = -waste\n\n    # Adjust priority based on how full the bin would be.

This suggests that directly minimizing waste and accounting for fill ratio using numpy operations are important.\n*Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see*: The second-best heuristic uses fill ratio and near-full bonuses. The second worst prioritizes fill ratio and penalizes small waste and prioritizes enough space. Thus, exponential bonuses for almost full is prefered than linear functions for penalizing small waste.\n*Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see*: The best uses waste, fill ratio and waste penalty. The second best uses fill ratio, and near full bonus. The scaling factor and exact formula matters.\n*Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see*: The third uses fill ratio, penalizes small waste and bonus almost full. The fourth uses waste, fill ratio and waste penalty. A key difference is the waste_penalty. The fourth approach is ranked lower, suggesting that a more refined handling of remaining space is more effective.\n*Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see*: There is no difference.\n*Overall*: The better heuristics balances fill ratio, waste minimization, and fragmentation avoidance. Specifically, the better performing heuristics use numpy operations to directly compute waste, fill ratio, and apply penalties/bonuses. The best heuristic used a exponential penalty functions and scaled fill ration.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective for designing bin packing heuristics.\n\nHere's a breakdown focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial evaluation, Performance bottlenecks, Fine-tuning, Non-linearity.\n\n*   **Advice:** Profile numpy operations to identify performance bottlenecks. Experiment systematically with different functional forms (exponential, logarithmic, sigmoid) for penalties/bonuses. Analyze the sensitivity of the heuristic to changes in scaling parameters.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about \"considering\" factors. Avoid prematurely committing to specific functions without empirical validation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Move beyond general goals. Focus on the *how* \u2013 profiling, experimentation, and sensitivity analysis are key to iterative improvement of heuristics.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
