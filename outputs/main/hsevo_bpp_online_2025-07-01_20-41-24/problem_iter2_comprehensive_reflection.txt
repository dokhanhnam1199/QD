Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to make it more effective for designing better bin packing heuristics, focusing on avoiding pitfalls that lead to ineffective analysis.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Data-driven, adaptive, iterative, performance metrics, failure analysis, diversity.

*   **Advice:** Analyze heuristic performance on diverse datasets. Track key metrics (bin count, runtime, waste). Use failures to refine priority functions and explore parameter tuning. Encourage exploration of diverse heuristic combinations.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on intuition, neglecting edge cases, ignoring computational cost, lack of performance measurement.

*   **Explanation:** Shift from solely formula-based to data-driven. Emphasize iterative improvement using performance data across varied scenarios. Actively identify failure points to drive refinement and adaptation.
