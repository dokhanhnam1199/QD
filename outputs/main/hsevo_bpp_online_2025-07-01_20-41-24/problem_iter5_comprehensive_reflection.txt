Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design, specifically addressing the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection."

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Objective measurement, Adaptability, Realistic Constraints, Iterative Improvement.
*   **Advice:** Focus on *quantifiable* metrics like items packed per unit time, solution feasibility rate, and solution quality variance. Design for adaptability to different dataset characteristics.
*   **Avoid:** Overly complex formulas (exponential, ratios without clear justification), vague priorities (near-full), and reliance on intuition without empirical validation.
*   **Explanation:** Emphasize measuring performance to guide heuristic refinement. Design heuristics that adapt to various data patterns and avoid unnecessary complexity.
