{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nDesign heuristics should consider multiple factors like fill ratio, waste, and fragmentation. Using numpy operations to efficiently calculate these factors is crucial. Fine-tuning the scaling and functional form of penalties and bonuses is important for good performance. Specifically, consider the potential benefits of exponential functions.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics for bin packing, consider a multifaceted approach that combines filling efficiency, waste reduction, and initial capacity. Use exponential functions and ratios to create nuanced priority scores and consider normalization. Prioritize near-full bins and penalize significant waste.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, focus on minimizing waste and maximizing fill ratio. Implement bonuses for perfect or near-perfect fits. Effectively handle infeasible bins by assigning very low priorities. Carefully consider the impact of penalties, avoiding over-penalization of bins that are close to fitting.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
