Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for designing bin packing heuristics.

Here's a breakdown focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial evaluation, Performance bottlenecks, Fine-tuning, Non-linearity.

*   **Advice:** Profile numpy operations to identify performance bottlenecks. Experiment systematically with different functional forms (exponential, logarithmic, sigmoid) for penalties/bonuses. Analyze the sensitivity of the heuristic to changes in scaling parameters.

*   **Avoid:** Vague statements about "considering" factors. Avoid prematurely committing to specific functions without empirical validation.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond general goals. Focus on the *how* â€“ profiling, experimentation, and sensitivity analysis are key to iterative improvement of heuristics.
