**Analysis:**

*Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see*: The best heuristic uses a combination of waste minimization, fill ratio maximization, and a penalty for close fits implemented using numpy operations; The worst gives priority based on fill ratio, avoidance of perfect fits, penalization for small waste and prioritizing bins with enough space. This suggests that directly minimizing waste and accounting for fill ratio using numpy operations are important.
*Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see*: The second-best heuristic uses fill ratio and near-full bonuses. The second worst prioritizes fill ratio and penalizes small waste and prioritizes enough space. Thus, exponential bonuses for almost full is prefered than linear functions for penalizing small waste.
*Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see*: The best uses waste, fill ratio and waste penalty. The second best uses fill ratio, and near full bonus. The scaling factor and exact formula matters.
*Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see*: The third uses fill ratio, penalizes small waste and bonus almost full. The fourth uses waste, fill ratio and waste penalty. A key difference is the waste_penalty. The fourth approach is ranked lower, suggesting that a more refined handling of remaining space is more effective.
*Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see*: There is no difference.
*Overall*: The better heuristics balances fill ratio, waste minimization, and fragmentation avoidance. Specifically, the better performing heuristics use numpy operations to directly compute waste, fill ratio, and apply penalties/bonuses. The best heuristic used a exponential penalty functions and scaled fill ration.

**Experience:**

Design heuristics should consider multiple factors like fill ratio, waste, and fragmentation. Using numpy operations to efficiently calculate these factors is crucial. Fine-tuning the scaling and functional form of penalties and bonuses is important for good performance. Specifically, consider the potential benefits of exponential functions.
