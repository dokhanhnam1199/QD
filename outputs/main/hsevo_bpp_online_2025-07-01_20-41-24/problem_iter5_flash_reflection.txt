**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the 1st uses fill-based priority with perfect fit bonus and considers initial capacity, while the 20th combines tight fit, larger bins, and almost full bins but penalizes bins that are close to fitting. The 1st prioritizes minimizing waste and higher fill, while the 20th focuses on space utilization but does not handle infeasible bins as effectively, potentially leading to less optimal packing. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the 2nd uses fill ratio, near-full bonus, anti-fragmentation, and scaled capacity, whereas the 19th, which is the same as 20th, combines tight fit, larger bins, and almost full bins, but heavily penalizes bins that are close to fitting but don't fit. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the 1st gives a very big bonus to perfect fits, whereas the 2nd promotes an almost-full bonus. (3rd) vs (4th) the 3rd penalizes bins where the item barely fits, whereas the 4th uses gravitational force and the "almost full" heuristic. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics tend to prioritize minimizing waste and achieving high fill ratios, often incorporating bonuses for perfect or near-perfect fits. They also effectively penalize infeasible bins and may consider initial capacity. The inferior heuristics sometimes over-penalize near misses or lack a clear strategy for space utilization and fragmentation.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, focus on minimizing waste and maximizing fill ratio. Implement bonuses for perfect or near-perfect fits. Effectively handle infeasible bins by assigning very low priorities. Carefully consider the impact of penalties, avoiding over-penalization of bins that are close to fitting.
