Prioritize exact/close fits with high magnitudes. Penalize infeasibility and large wasted space. Encourage filling existing bins.

Simpler, relative metrics (fill ratio, scaled fragmentation) and direct rewards/penalties outperform complex rules and fixed constants.

Focus on infeasibility penalties, dynamic fill ratios, fragmentation, and similarity bonuses with adjusted scaling.

Prioritize exact/near fits, strongly penalize infeasibility and fragmentation, and dynamically scale rewards/penalties.

The better code uses infeasibility masks, capacity ratios, and Gaussian-like distribution for near-full bins, with adjusted weights.

Prioritize fill ratio, reward almost-full bins, penalize fragmentation dynamically, and heavily penalize infeasibility.

Prioritize exact/close fits with large rewards/penalties. Directly penalize wasted space and near-full infeasibility.

Focus on minimizing wasted space, penalizing near misses, and balancing bin fill levels.

Prioritize feasibility, exact/almost fits. Consider potential future placements and reduce fragmentation. Scale rewards appropriately.

Prioritize near-perfect fits with waste scaling, strong fragmentation penalties, and similarity bonuses. Intensify existing bin usage.
