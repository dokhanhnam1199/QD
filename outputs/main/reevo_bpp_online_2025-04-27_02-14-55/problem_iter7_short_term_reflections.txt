Prioritize feasibility, reward tight fits, penalize waste, and consider future item placements.

Focus on fill ratio, avoid absolute thresholds, and penalize fragmentation dynamically.

Prioritize tight fits, minimize wasted space, and penalize near misses and excessive capacity.

Prioritize tighter fits, penalize large wasted space, and avoid almost-full bins that can't accommodate.

Normalize wasted space/excess capacity by item size. Penalize near-full, infeasible bins proportionally. Encourage filling existing bins.

Prioritize exact/close fits with fixed rewards; penalize waste and infeasibility more consistently.

Prioritize tight fits, discourage large gaps, and penalize infeasibility strongly for online bin packing.

Prioritize tight fits, adaptive thresholds, and fill ratios. Penalize fragmentation.

Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize wasted space, and discourage under/over utilization. Add bonuses for fitting multiple similar items.

Prioritize feasible bins with tighter fits using capacity ratios and Gaussian rewards around zero remaining capacity.
