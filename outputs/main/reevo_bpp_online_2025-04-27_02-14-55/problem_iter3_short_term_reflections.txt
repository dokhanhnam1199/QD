Prioritize feasibility and perfect fits. Directly optimize remaining capacity and incentivize reusing bins.

The better code prioritizes bins with low *relative* remaining capacity after packing and rewards almost-full bins.

The better code uses explicit, prioritized rules and considers wasted space, leading to improved packing.

Prioritize fitting bins, normalize remainders, and penalize infeasible placements more heavily.

Prioritize tight fits and near-full bins. Discourage underutilized and almost-full bins directly using thresholds.

The better code uses a Gaussian-like distribution and emphasizes almost-full bins, plus penalizes when no bins fit.

The better code prioritizes minimizing wasted space after packing and strongly penalizes bins that don't fit.

The better code uses a Gaussian-like priority based on remaining space and boosts almost-full bins, improving bin utilization.

Prioritize perfect fits, minimize waste, and avoid opening new bins. Use masking for efficiency.

Prioritize tight fits using ratios instead of differences, and strongly penalize infeasible bins.
