Prioritize exact/near fits, penalize fragmentation/infeasibility severely, and reward similarity/usage of existing bins.

Reduced scaling, increased thresholds/rewards/penalties, and stricter infeasibility improved performance.

Prioritize simplicity, direct penalties/rewards, and avoid unnecessary scaling complexities for better performance.

Fine-tune Gaussian std, similarity threshold. Consider tracking bin contents for better similarity bonus.

Focus on fill ratio, fragmentation (relative to item size), and use of partially filled bins.

Fine-tune thresholds (near-fit, fragmentation, similarity, large capacity), and Gaussian std. Adjust reward/penalty scales.

Prioritize exact/near fits. Discourage fragmentation and large capacity. Use explicit, larger priority scores.

Prioritize exact/near fits with scaled rewards/penalties. Dynamically adjust penalties based on item/bin sizes.

Scaling fragmentation penalty by item size and tuning bonus/penalty magnitudes improved performance.

Prioritize exact/near fits. Discretize priorities. Penalize near-full bins, reward partially full ones.
