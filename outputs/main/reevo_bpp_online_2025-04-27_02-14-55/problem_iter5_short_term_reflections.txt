Explicitly reward exact/almost fits, penalize near-misses, and consider wasted space for better packing.

Prioritize exact/near fits, minimize waste, penalize near-full/oversized bins, and incentivize filling existing bins.

Prioritize exact/near fits with large values. Use negative values to penalize bad choices. Exploit bin capacity information.

Prioritize feasible bins, directly use remaining capacity, and scale Gaussian variance to bin size.

Prioritize relative remaining capacity. Heavily penalize bins that cannot fit. Add bonuses for near-perfect fits.

Prioritize tight fits using remaining capacity, penalize infeasibility strongly, and refine Gaussian parameters.

Prioritize tight fits and near-full bins after placement. Adaptive thresholds and considering item size are beneficial.

Prioritize exact/near fits with large constants. Use negative rewards. Avoid high capacity bins. Exploit non-empty bins.

Prioritize tight fits using fill ratio, and strongly incentivize nearly-full bins. If no bins fit, create new one.

The better code prioritizes tighter fits, uses a normalized Gaussian, and directly penalizes infeasible bins for better performance.
