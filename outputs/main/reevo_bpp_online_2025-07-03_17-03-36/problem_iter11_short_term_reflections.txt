The better code normalizes remaining capacity, adjusts thresholds, and balances bin usage incentives.

Normalize features, add nuanced rewards/penalties, and consider edge cases for better performance.

Normalize, penalize fragmentation, reward near-perfect fits, and balance bin fill levels for better performance.

Focus on best-fit, moderate fill avoidance, and item-size-dependent bonuses/penalties with well-tuned thresholds.

Removing the "Simplified rule: Slightly prefer bins with capacity closest to item size" improved performance.

Removing the "Simplified rule" focusing on item fit improved performance. Bin balancing is beneficial.

Key improvements: Moderate fill penalty, increased fragmentation threshold/penalty/near-perfect bonus, bin balancing.

The better code uses moderate fill penalties, bin balancing, and item-size fit preference to improve performance.

Normalization, fragmentation penalties, perfect-fit rewards, and item-size-dependent bonuses improve bin packing.

Normalize features, tune penalties/rewards, balance exploration/exploitation, and consider item size.
