Prioritize feasibility, minimize waste, normalize scores, and penalize fragmentation for effective bin packing.

Prioritize minimal waste, boost best fits, and consider item size relative to bin capacity for better bin utilization.

Prioritize fit, minimize waste around ideal, encourage balanced bin usage, and avoid infinite penalties.

Prioritize fitting, minimize waste exponentially, penalize non-fitting weakly, and add tie-breaking randomness.

The better code prioritizes feasibility, tighter fits, and reduces fragmentation, along with a touch of First-Fit.

Prioritize feasibility, fill ratio, perfect fits, and avoid tiny fragments. Refine with inverse remaining capacity.

Prioritize moderate fill levels. Heavily penalize bins that cannot fit or are almost full.

The better code simplifies prioritization to minimize wasted space, avoiding complex, conflicting rules present in the worse code.

The better code prioritizes "Best Fit" by inverting remaining capacity and strongly penalizes infeasible bins.

Better code prioritizes minimizing wasted space in fitting bins, and handles the no-fit scenario more effectively via worst-fit.
