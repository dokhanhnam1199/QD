Feasibility first. Prioritize best fit, moderate fill levels, and punish small relative item sizes.

Normalization, fragmentation/near-perfect fit considerations, and encouraging empty bin usage improve performance.

Prioritize feasibility with large penalties. Target moderate fill levels and consolidate items effectively.

Focus on fragmentation, reward near-perfect fits, and encourage using emptier bins when available.

Focus on feasibility, best fit, relative item size, fragmentation avoidance, and initial fill level.

Prioritize feasibility. Best fit, relative size, fill level, and existing fullness improve packing density.

Prioritize feasibility strictly. Target optimal fill levels and item size ratios for better packing.

Focus on feasibility first. Then, directly prioritize best-fit using a simple, effective reward function.

Prioritize absolute remaining capacity. Avoid normalization. Refine fragment/near-full conditions for stability.

Fragmentation handling, near-perfect fit rewards, and emptier bin encouragement improve online bin packing.
