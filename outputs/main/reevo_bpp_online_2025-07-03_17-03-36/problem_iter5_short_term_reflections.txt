Prioritize feasibility and best fit. Discourage small relative item sizes and near-full bins for better packing.

Focus on feasibility, best fit, relative item size, and avoiding near-full bins. Use clear, scaled penalties.

Better heuristics: Prioritize tight fits proportionally; penalize overfilled bins linearly, not exponentially.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, penalize small relative item sizes, and avoid almost-full bins for better packing.

Perfect fit wins. Minimize waste, strongly penalize infeasibility, and avoid full bins.

Explicitly enforce feasibility, and prioritize moderate fill levels using remaining capacity.

Prioritize feasibility, best fit, and filling bins well; penalize small fills and near-full bins.

Feasibility is paramount. Directly optimize for best fit, balancing waste and future accommodation; Scaling is helpful.

The better code uses a simpler, more direct, and numerically stable priority function focusing on best fit.

The better code uses explicit features (feasibility, remaining capacity, fragmentation) with normalization and bonuses/penalties.
