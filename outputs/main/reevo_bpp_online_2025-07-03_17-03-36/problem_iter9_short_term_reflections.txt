Prioritize feasibility absolutely. Use direct, unnormalized remaining capacity. Penalize both small fragments and near-full bins.

Normalize priorities. Penalize fragmentation. Encourage near-perfect fits. Discourage placing small items in partially-filled bins.

Focus on remaining capacity normalization, fragmentation, near-perfect fits, and empty/full bin awareness.

Prioritize feasibility, directly optimize remaining capacity, and avoid excessive parameter tuning.

Normalization, clear infeasibility handling, fragmentation/perfect-fit focus, and problem-specific penalties improve performance.

Focus on consistent normalization, moderate fill, and adaptive item-size penalties for improved bin packing.

The better code normalizes `remaining_after_fit` more robustly and prioritizes emptier bins, improving bin utilization.

Normalize using bin capacity. Penalize nearly full/empty bins and small items into partially filled bins.

Simpler priority functions focused on best-fit and moderate fill, with small incentives/penalties, perform better.

Prioritize normalized remaining capacity, control fragmentation, and strategically reward empty/larger bins.
