To refine "Current self-reflection" and design better heuristics, here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords**: Heuristics design, prioritization formula, tie-breaking mechanism.
* **Advice**: Develop a more sophisticated prioritization formula that considers multiple factors, such as item size, remaining capacity, and potentially other attributes like item value or urgency.
* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, neglecting edge cases, and failing to incorporate diverse factors.
* **Explanation**: By developing a nuanced formula and incorporating a robust tie-breaking mechanism, such as a well-designed noise function, we can create more effective heuristics that outperform simple, existing methods, justifying a significant improvement like the one worth $999K.
