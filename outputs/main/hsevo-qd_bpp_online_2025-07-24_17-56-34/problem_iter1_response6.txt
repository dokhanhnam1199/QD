    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    
    This function implements a priority function for the online Bin Packing Problem.
    The priority is higher for bins that have enough capacity for the item and 
    have less remaining capacity, thus packing items tightly.
    
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the priority score for each bin
    # For bins that can fit the item, the priority is inversely proportional to the remaining capacity
    # For bins that cannot fit the item, the priority is negative infinity
    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-6), -np.inf)
    
    return priority
