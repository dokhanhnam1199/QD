### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the priority score for each bin based on the remaining capacity
    # The bin with the least remaining capacity that can still fit the item gets the highest priority
    priority = np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item, 1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6), -1.0)
    # Add a small random noise to break ties
    priority += np.random.uniform(0, 1e-6, size=len(bins_remain_cap))
    return priority

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    The priority is determined by how well the item fits into the bin.
    A higher priority is given to bins where the item fits perfectly or 
    almost perfectly (i.e., remaining capacity is minimized after adding 
    the item). Bins that cannot accommodate the item are given a priority 
    of negative infinity.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item to each bin
    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # Bins that cannot accommodate the item should have a priority of negative infinity
    priority = np.where(remaining_cap_after_addition >= 0, -remaining_cap_after_addition, -np.inf)
    
    # Normalize the priority scores to be between 0 and 1
    max_priority = np.max(priority)
    if max_priority == -np.inf:  # All bins are too small
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    else:
        return (priority + np.inf) / (max_priority + np.inf)

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a meaningful calculation for priority based on the remaining capacity and adds a small random noise to break ties, while the worst simply returns zeros. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use a similar strategy but differ in the exact formula; (1st) uses `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6)` while (2nd) uses `1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item))`. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows a similar pattern with different formulas. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both return zeros or constant values, indicating a lack of a meaningful heuristic. 
Overall, better heuristics tend to use formulas that prioritize bins based on how well the item fits, with some form of tie-breaking.
- 
To refine "Current self-reflection" and design better heuristics, here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords**: Heuristics design, prioritization formula, tie-breaking mechanism.
* **Advice**: Develop a more sophisticated prioritization formula that considers multiple factors, such as item size, remaining capacity, and potentially other attributes like item value or urgency.
* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, neglecting edge cases, and failing to incorporate diverse factors.
* **Explanation**: By developing a nuanced formula and incorporating a robust tie-breaking mechanism, such as a well-designed noise function, we can create more effective heuristics that outperform simple, existing methods, justifying a significant improvement like the one worth $999K.

Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.
Output the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """
    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    # Calculate the remaining capacity after adding the item to each bin
    remaining_cap_after_addition = bins_remain_cap - item
    
    # For bins that can fit the item, the priority is the negative of the remaining capacity after addition
    # This encourages the algorithm to choose the bin with the least remaining capacity that can still fit the item
    priority = np.where(remaining_cap_after_addition >= 0, -remaining_cap_after_addition, -np.inf)
    
    return priority

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:
- 
To refine "Current self-reflection" and design better heuristics, here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords**: Heuristics design, prioritization formula, tie-breaking mechanism.
* **Advice**: Develop a more sophisticated prioritization formula that considers multiple factors, such as item size, remaining capacity, and potentially other attributes like item value or urgency.
* **Avoid**: Oversimplification, neglecting edge cases, and failing to incorporate diverse factors.
* **Explanation**: By developing a nuanced formula and incorporating a robust tie-breaking mechanism, such as a well-designed noise function, we can create more effective heuristics that outperform simple, existing methods, justifying a significant improvement like the one worth $999K.

Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

You are an expert in code review. Your task extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters.
User Prompt: 
[code]
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Priority score based on how well the item fits into the bin and a small random noise to break ties.
    """

    # Add a small random noise to break ties
    priority += np.random.uniform(0, 1e-6, size=len(bins_remain_cap))
    return priority

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
