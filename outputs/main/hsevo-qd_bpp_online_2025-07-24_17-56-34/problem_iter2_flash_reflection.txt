**Analysis:**
Comparing the best heuristic (1st) with the worst (20th), we see that the best heuristic uses a meaningful calculation for priority based on the remaining capacity and adds a small random noise to break ties, while the worst simply returns zeros. 
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see both use a similar strategy but differ in the exact formula; (1st) uses `1 / (bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-6)` while (2nd) uses `1 / (1 + np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item))`. 
(3rd) vs (4th) shows a similar pattern with different formulas. 
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both return zeros or constant values, indicating a lack of a meaningful heuristic. 
Overall, better heuristics tend to use formulas that prioritize bins based on how well the item fits, with some form of tie-breaking.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, focus on creating a meaningful formula that prioritizes bins based on the item size and remaining capacity, and consider adding a mechanism to break ties, such as a small random noise.
