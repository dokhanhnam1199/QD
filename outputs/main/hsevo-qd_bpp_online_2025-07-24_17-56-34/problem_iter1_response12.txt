    Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    
    This function implements the First-Fit decreasing heuristic. It prioritizes 
    bins that have just enough remaining capacity to fit the item. If a bin 
    doesn't have enough capacity, its priority is set to negative infinity.
    
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.

    # Check if the item can fit into each bin

    # Initialize priority scores with negative infinity for bins that are too small
    priority = np.where(valid_bins, bins_remain_cap - item, -np.inf)
    
    # Prioritize bins that are filled the most after adding the item
    priority = np.where(valid_bins, -priority, priority)
