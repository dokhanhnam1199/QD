Your task is to write a priority function using the Sigmoid Fit Score strategy for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

    return priorities

[Reflection]
Prioritize exact fits & fuller bins; consider item order & bin diversity.

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize exact fits & fuller bins; consider item order & bin diversity.
Prioritize minimizing waste & consider item-bin *fit*, not just remaining capacity. Exact fits are valuable!




Prioritize bins by fit—closer fit, higher priority; avoid zero distances & explore different distance metrics.




Prioritize exact fits, then minimize wasted space; simple, weighted scoring often outperforms complex normalization.
Prioritize tighter fits—inverse distance is key! Avoid zero divisions & consider softmax for probabilistic choices.




Prioritize tighter fits, explore strategically (like sigmoid), and validate bin capacities consistently.
Prioritize tighter fits; inverse distance/sigmoid scoring generally outperforms random/zero-based approaches for bin packing.




Prioritize exploration strategically; simple randomization (like Random Fit) often beats complex, poorly tuned exploration (Epsilon-Greedy).
Prioritize exploration *within* feasible bins; simple randomization often outperforms complex epsilon-greedy schemes.
Prioritize valid bins, tune sigmoid steepness (k), and avoid zero-division issues for robust performance.





Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
## BPP Heuristic Design: Quick Hints

**Focus:** Prioritize exact fits & tightest feasible fits (inverse distance/sigmoid scoring). Explore *within* valid bins—simple randomization often beats complex schemes. Validate bin capacities & avoid zero divisions! Prioritize fit *over* just remaining capacity.





[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    # Calculate the distance between the item size and the remaining capacity of each bin.
    distances = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)

    # Assign priority scores based on the inverse of the distance.
    # Add a small constant to avoid division by zero and stabilize the function
    priorities = 1.0 / (distances + 1e-6)

    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
