Focus on inverse distance weighting, gentle utilization rewards, and slight penalties for poor fits.




Prioritize minimizing wasted space; reward both tight & spacious fits, adjust weights dynamically.
Focus on *fit* (distance to ideal capacity) & avoid extremes; gentle spaciousness rewards help.




Focus on inverse distance, rewarding spacious/near-full bins, and avoiding strong penalties. Simplicity often wins.




Focus on inverse relationships & reward both spaciousness *and* full utilizationâ€”avoid direct ratios.
Focus on fit, remaining capacity, and reward well-utilized (but not full) bins. Avoid penalizing viable options.
Prioritize tighter fits & reward both spaciousness *and* near-full bins; avoid overly complex bonuses.




Focus on fit, reward ample space, and near-perfect matches; avoid complex, unnecessary functions.
Focus on *relative* fit & penalize extreme capacities; avoid simple weighted sums.
Tune reward thresholds & magnitudes; prioritize fitting *and* utilization; avoid overly sparse/full bins.
