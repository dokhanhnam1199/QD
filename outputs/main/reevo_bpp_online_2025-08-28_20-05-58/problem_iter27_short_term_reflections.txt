Prioritize feasibility, spaciousness, and near-full bins; balance exploration with small, consistent bonuses.
Focus on relative item-bin size, tune bonuses, and avoid overly specific thresholds. Simplicity often wins!
Focus on feasibility first, then reward spaciousness & near-full bins—avoid gentle penalties.
Focus on relative capacity & smooth prioritization; avoid rigid thresholds & excessive bonuses.
Focus on relative capacity & tunable bonuses; avoid overly complex, absolute thresholds. Simplicity often wins.
Focus on absolute fit *and* reward bin spaciousness/near-full states; avoid relative comparisons.
Prioritize feasibility, spaciousness, and near-full bins; balance exploration with small, consistent bonuses.
Focus on relative capacity, tune bonuses carefully, and avoid overly complex, absolute thresholds.
Focus on relative item size, prioritize tight fits, and tune bonus weights carefully.
Prioritize smoothness, adjust bonus thresholds, and simplify—less is often more effective.
