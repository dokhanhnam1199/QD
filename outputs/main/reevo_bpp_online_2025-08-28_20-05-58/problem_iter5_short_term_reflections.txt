Prioritize exact fits & minimize waste. Explore combining fit-based scores with bin fullness awareness.
Prioritize exact fits heavily; inverse distance is good, but simplicity often wins. Consider bin fullness directly.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and avoid near-full bin penalties—simplicity & directness often win.
Prioritize near-fits! Simpler, broader scoring (inverse distance) often beats complex, exact-match focus.
Prioritize exact fits aggressively; inverse distance is good, but simplicity often wins. Consider bin fullness directly.




Prioritize exact fits heavily; focus on feasible bins & tighter fits for better performance.




Favor smooth, probabilistic scoring (like softmax) over hard rules & direct distance inversion.
Prioritize minimizing waste; inverse distance/remaining capacity often outperforms simple exact-fit or fill-level heuristics.




Favor smooth probability distributions & consider *all* bins, not just immediately viable ones.
Prioritize tighter fits & exact matches; randomness can hinder performance—exploit remaining capacity information.
