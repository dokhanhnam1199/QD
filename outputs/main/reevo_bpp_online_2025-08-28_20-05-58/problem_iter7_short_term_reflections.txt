Prioritize minimizing waste; inverse distance & exact fits are strong signals. Simplicity often wins.




Favor smooth, probabilistic selection; consider all bins, not just feasible ones. Explore scaling priorities.




Prioritize closer fits & probabilistic selection; avoid simple ratios & absolute values. Consider fragmentation penalties.




Prioritize probability distributions & smoothness; avoid hard thresholds like the initial "1000.0" value. Consider bin fullness.




Prioritize probabilistic bin selection; consider item-bin compatibility beyond just remaining capacity.
Prioritize probabilistic bin selection; consider distance to full *and* item size ratios.
Prioritize simplicity & feasibility; avoid over-complication. Inverse distance consistently works well for bin packing.
Prioritize minimizing future fragmentation; inverse distance/waste often works well, avoid exact fit obsession.




Favor inverse distance to remaining capacity; avoid ratios, use absolute differences & small offsets.
Prioritize probabilistic bin selection; consider item-bin *distance*, not just ratios/fullness.
