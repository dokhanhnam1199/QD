Reward spaciousness & near-full bins; gently penalize almost-full ones; avoid strong, rigid bonuses.




Prioritize distance, ample capacity, and near-perfect fits; avoid strong initial preferences.
Focus on bin suitability: distance to item size, perfect fits, and spaciousness bonuses. Avoid relative capacities.




Reward spaciousness & near-full bins; avoid overly penalizing larger remaining capacities. Consider item-relative thresholds.




Prioritize tighter fits, reward spaciousness, and avoid overly full or empty bins—balance is key!
Focus on simple, weighted remaining capacity; avoid complex, potentially canceling boosts/penalties. Less is more!




Prioritize near-full bins, reward ample space, and penalize extreme mismatches—fine-tune boosts/penalties carefully.




Focus on rewarding spaciousness & utilization, avoid overly complex bonuses, & ensure non-negative priorities.




Focus on utilization, smoothness, and gentle penalties/rewards—avoid harsh cutoffs. Consider relative capacity carefully.
Tune reward/penalty thresholds & magnitudes; prioritize fitting *and* future packing potential.
