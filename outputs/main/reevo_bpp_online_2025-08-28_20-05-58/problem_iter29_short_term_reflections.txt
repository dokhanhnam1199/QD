Focus on fit, reward spaciousness/near-fullness subtly, and avoid negative priorities—simplicity often wins!

Focus on fit, reward spaciousness/near-fullness subtly, and *always* ensure non-negative priorities. Simplicity often wins.




Reward spaciousness & near-full bins; tune thresholds carefully; avoid division by zero.
Focus on smooth weighting, avoid strong biases, and prioritize fitting over spaciousness/fullness.
Smooth, normalized rewards & focusing on relative capacity outperform simple bonuses—explore Gaussian-weighted preferences.
Prioritize tight fits & spaciousness; reward near-full bins heavily, avoid simply encouraging use.
Reward spaciousness & utilization, tune bonus magnitudes, avoid negative priorities—balance exploration & exploitation.




Prioritize spacious bins & near-full utilization; tune bonus magnitudes for item-capacity relationships.




Focus on fit, reward spaciousness/near-fullness subtly, and avoid negative priorities. Simplicity often wins!
Focus on bin suitability thresholds & simple rewards; avoid complex functions. Prioritize clear, targeted bin preference.
