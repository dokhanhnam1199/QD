Prioritize exact fits & fuller bins; consider item order & bin diversity.
Prioritize minimizing waste & consider item-bin *fit*, not just remaining capacity. Exact fits are valuable!




Prioritize bins by fit—closer fit, higher priority; avoid zero distances & explore different distance metrics.




Prioritize exact fits, then minimize wasted space; simple, weighted scoring often outperforms complex normalization.
Prioritize tighter fits—inverse distance is key! Avoid zero divisions & consider softmax for probabilistic choices.




Prioritize tighter fits, explore strategically (like sigmoid), and validate bin capacities consistently.
Prioritize tighter fits; inverse distance/sigmoid scoring generally outperforms random/zero-based approaches for bin packing.




Prioritize exploration strategically; simple randomization (like Random Fit) often beats complex, poorly tuned exploration (Epsilon-Greedy).
Prioritize exploration *within* feasible bins; simple randomization often outperforms complex epsilon-greedy schemes.
Prioritize valid bins, tune sigmoid steepness (k), and avoid zero-division issues for robust performance.
