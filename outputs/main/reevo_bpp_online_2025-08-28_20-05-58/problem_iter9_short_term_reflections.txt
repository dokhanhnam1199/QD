Prioritize tighter fits, reward spacious bins, and avoid overly complex/sensitive penalties. Simplicity often wins!




Prioritize near-full bins & exact fits; avoid normalizing prematurely—maximize, don't distribute, priority.
Prioritize near-perfect fits, reward ample space, and avoid zero-priority bins—smoothness matters!
Prioritize tighter fits, reward ample space, and avoid division by zero; combine additive & multiplicative factors.




Prioritize exact fits & minimize internal fragmentation—inverse distance weighting excels here. Consider bin fullness too.




Prioritize near-perfect fits & ample space; consider absolute differences, not just remainders.
Focus on inverse distance, capacity boosting, & fragmentation penalties—balance utilization & avoiding small gaps.




Focus on rewarding larger remaining capacities & fine-tune distance-based scoring; avoid overly specific thresholds.
Focus on inverse distance, ample capacity boosts, and precise fit prioritization—smoothness matters!

Prioritize minimizing wasted space; simple distance-based scoring often outperforms complex, rule-based approaches.
