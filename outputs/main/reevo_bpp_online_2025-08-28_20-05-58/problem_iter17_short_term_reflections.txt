Prioritize simplicity & direct fit; boost ample space & reward near-perfect matches. Avoid complex, smoothed rewards.




Focus on remaining capacity *and* how well items fit—consider distance & boosts!
Prioritize simplicity, inverse weighting, and gentle rewards/penalties based on bin utilization. Avoid complex exponentials.
Focus on relative comparisons (item size vs. bin capacity) & adjust reward/penalty thresholds carefully.
Focus on rewarding spacious bins & near-full utilization, carefully tuning thresholds & magnitudes. Simplicity often wins.




Focus on smooth weighting, avoid strong penalties, and reward both fit & spaciousness.
Focus on relative fit—reward bins slightly larger/smaller than the item, avoid overly spacious ones.
Prioritize tight fits, reward medium-full bins, and avoid overly-full or empty ones. Simplicity often wins.




Focus on simplicity, relative distance, and rewarding bin spaciousness/near-full utilization—avoid complex smoothing.




Prioritize spaciousness, near-full utilization, and avoid *almost*-full bins; gentle weighting is key.
