Focus on rewarding spacious bins & near-perfect fits; penalizing tight/small bins less. Simplicity often wins.




Focus on rewarding both spaciousness *and* near-full bin utilization; avoid overly strong perfect-fit biases.
Prioritize inverse distance, ample space, perfect fits, and avoid zero priorities—small constants help!

Prioritize near-perfect fits, ample space, & penalize almost-full bins; combine distance with item/bin-size ratios.




Focus on rewarding spacious bins & perfect fits; penalizing near-full bins is less impactful.

Focus on rewarding spaciousness & near-full bins, gently penalizing almost-full ones; avoid strong penalties.
Simplicity often wins! Focus on core fit; avoid over-rewarding spaciousness/utilization.

Prioritize inverse distance, ample capacity, perfect fits, and avoid zero priorities—small constant boosts help!
Focus on relative capacity, simple rewards for spacious/near-full bins, and avoid complex calculations.




Prioritize near-fits & ample space; avoid impossible bins. Combine distance-based & capacity-based rewards.
