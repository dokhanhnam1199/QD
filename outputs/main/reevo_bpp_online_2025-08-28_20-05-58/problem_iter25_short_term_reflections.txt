Focus on fit, spaciousness, and near-full bins; small bonuses can also help. Prioritize clear, distinct scoring.




Focus on smooth weighting, capacity-aware rewards, and avoid overly complex, rigid rules. Simplicity often wins.




Focus on relative capacity, smooth weighting, and avoid overly complex, rigid thresholds. Simplicity often wins!
Focus on fit, spaciousness, and nearly-full bins; balance exploration with exploitation rewards.
Prioritize feasible fits, reward spaciousness/near-full bins, and use small, consistent bonuses.

Focus on fit, gentle utilization rewards, and avoid overly strong, fixed exploration bonuses.
Focus on tighter fit, moderate spaciousness rewards, and aggressive near-full prioritization—balance is key.
Focus on fit, spaciousness, and near-full bins; use relative comparisons & small, consistent bonuses.




Focus on feasibility first, then prioritize tight fits & exploration—avoid overly complex bonuses.
Focus on *relative* item-bin sizes & reward balanced utilization; avoid extremes. Small, informed penalties help.
