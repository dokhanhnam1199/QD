Prioritize balance: reward spaciousness, gently nudge near-full/empty bins, avoid strong penalties.
Focus on simpler, stronger rewards for spacious bins & moderate utilization; avoid excessive penalization.




Focus on relative capacity, reward utilization, and gently penalize near-full bins. Avoid overly strict thresholds.
Focus on fit quality, spaciousness, and avoid nearly-full bins; simpler bonuses often outperform complex penalties.




Prioritize ample space & near-perfect fits; tune boosting factors for problem-specific item sizes.

Prioritize ample space & near-perfect fits; avoid strong biases with small constant boosts.
Prioritize fit *and* space, subtly penalize near-full bins; validate inputs for robustness.
Reward spaciousness & utilization; gently penalize near-full/empty bins; avoid strong negatives.

Prioritize ample space, good fits, & penalize near-full/oversized bins; tune boosting/penalizing weights.




Focus on rewarding good fit, penalizing waste, and ensuring numerical stabilityâ€”simplicity often wins.
