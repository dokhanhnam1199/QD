Focus on fit, remaining capacity, and reward well-utilized (but not full) bins. Explore constants carefully.




Prioritize fitting *and* utilization; tune reward thresholds (1.5x & 0.5x) for bin spaciousness/fullness.
Focus on inverse distance, rewarding spaciousness *and* near-full bins—adjust thresholds carefully.




Subtle reward/penalty tuning & considering bin fullness—gentle adjustments often outperform drastic ones.




Focus on smooth reward shaping, considering fit *and* bin utilization—avoid extremes.
Focus on gentle weighting, ideal fit, and avoid overly strong rewards/penalties. Consider item-relative bin capacity.




Focus on *relative* fit, penalize extremes, and reward reasonable utilization—avoid simple absolute distances.




Prioritize item-size-relative spaciousness & utilization; tune weights carefully for balance. Avoid overly gentle rewards.




Focus on fit, reward ample space, and prioritize near-full bins—balance is key!
Focus on feasibility first, then reward good fit & spaciousness; avoid overly complex combinations.
