Prioritize fitting bins, minimize wasted space, avoid fragmentation, and strategically use empty bins.

Prioritize fitting bins, reward near-full bins, and penalize excessive fragmentation. Adapt penalties based on item size.

Prioritize fitting bins, reward nearly-full bins, and discourage empty bins unless the item is large.

Explicitly prioritize fitting bins, reward near-full bins, and penalize creating too many empty bins.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize large items and underutilized bins, and consider bin capacity utilization.

Prioritize fitting bins, reward tightness/near-fullness, discourage empty bins unless item is large, and handle infeasibility.

Prioritize fitting bins, reward near-full bins, and penalize empty bins unless the item is large.

The better code uses bin capacity, remaining space, and fullness to guide item placement, avoiding fragmentation.

Prioritize fitting, reward tightness/near-fullness. Penalize empties cautiously. Add randomness to break ties.

Both functions are identical. Focus on more adaptive penalty/reward values for better performance.
