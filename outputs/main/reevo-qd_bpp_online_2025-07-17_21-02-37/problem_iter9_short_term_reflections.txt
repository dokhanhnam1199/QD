Tie-breaking randomness should consider all feasible bins. Adapt penalty strength based on remaining capacity distribution.

Prioritize fitting items and discourage fragmentation. When no fit exists, consider future item sizes.

Stronger rewards/penalties, adaptive thresholds, and refined tie-breaking improve bin packing heuristics.

The better code prioritizes fitting items, reduces fragmentation, and uses incentives/penalties based on capacity.

Prioritize feasible bins. Use tighter fit bonuses and empty bin strategies based on item size.

The better code uses explicit rules, adaptive thresholds, and prioritized tighter fits, fragmentation reduction, and empty bin handling.

Consider empty bin placement more carefully. When no bin fits, prioritize bins that have more capacity.

Prioritize fitting bins, reward near-full bins, and penalize empty bins unless the item is large.

The better code uses explicit rules, bonuses/penalties, and tie-breaking for optimized bin selection.

Prioritize feasible bins. Encourage tighter fits and near-full bins. Discourage empty bins for smaller items.
