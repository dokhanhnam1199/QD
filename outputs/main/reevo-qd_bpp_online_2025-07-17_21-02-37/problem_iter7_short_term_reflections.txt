Prioritize fitting bins. Encourage near-full bins, penalize fragmentation, and break ties randomly.

Both versions are identical. Focus on diverse bin selection, bin utilization variance reduction, and adaptive parameter tuning.

Prioritize fitting bins, reward tighter fits/near-full bins, discourage empty bins (adaptive thresholds), and add tie-breaking randomness.

The improved code prioritizes fitting, tightness, fullness, and discourages fragmentation with adaptive thresholds and tie-breaking.

Encouraging large items into empty bins and factoring in remaining capacity leads to improvements.

Prioritize fitting bins; reward tighter fits and near-full bins. Discourage creating empty or near-empty bins.

Prioritize fitting bins. Reward nearly full bins and penalize empty ones unless the item is large.

Stronger rewards/penalties, adaptive thresholds, and tie-breaking randomness are key improvements.

Stronger rewards/penalties, adaptive thresholds, and randomness reduction improve bin packing heuristics.

Stronger rewards/penalties, adaptive thresholds, and penalizing large remaining capacities improve bin packing.
