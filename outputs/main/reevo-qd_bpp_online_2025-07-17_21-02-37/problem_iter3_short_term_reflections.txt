Explicitly reward desired fill levels, penalize empty bins, and add randomness for exploration improve online bin packing.

Prioritize near-full bins directly, avoid complex calculations, and use explicit loops for clarity.

Prioritize snug fits, discourage fragmentation, and use stricter bin capacity thresholds with larger penalties.

Focus on remaining capacity after insertion. Prioritize fuller bins. If no fit, allow new bin creation.

The better code uses a simpler, direct priority based on remaining capacity, mimicking First-Fit Decreasing.

The better code directly prioritizes bins based on *remaining* capacity after item placement, driving higher fill rates.

The better code directly prioritizes bins with minimal remaining space after fitting, a simpler, more effective strategy.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid empty bins unless necessary, and adapt classic heuristics like First Fit Decreasing.

Focus on feasibility, minimizing waste, rewarding near-full bins, and handling the no-fit scenario.

Simplicity and direct optimization towards filling bins are key. Avoid complex rules and prioritize tighter fits.
