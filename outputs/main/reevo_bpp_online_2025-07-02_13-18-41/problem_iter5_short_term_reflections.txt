Focus on minimizing fragmentation, rewarding near-full/exact fits, and penalizing large remaining capacities more directly.

The better code uses absolute difference from ideal fill ratios and avoids separate waste/fragmentation penalties.

The better code uses relative metrics and noise for tie-breaking, improving exploration and balance.

Focus on infeasibility, relative wasted space, occupancy, and tie-breaking randomness for better bin packing.

Prioritize feasibility, smaller gaps, and avoid creating near-empty bins. Adjust penalties based on bin size for stability.

Prioritize feasibility and tight fits. Explicitly reward fitting. Handle small items differently based on occupancy.

The better code uses refined waste/fit metrics, explicit density, and avoids normalization, leading to improved bin utilization.

Prioritize filling, avoid fragmentation, and strongly incentivize bin completion with adaptive penalties/bonuses.

The better code uses a relative waste metric and avoids premature bin filling via `fit_threshold`. Normalizing capacity with bin sizes helps.

Prioritize capacity ratio, penalize waste, and softly avoid near-full bins for better packing.
