Prioritize relative wasted space, target fullness, and penalize large gaps. Adapt bonuses/penalties relative to item/bin size.

Focus on relative wasted space, target fullness, and adaptive penalties/bonuses based on item/bin size.

Focus on relative wasted space, target fullness, and prioritizing almost-full bins based on bin size.

Focus on relative wasted space, bin occupancy, target fullness, and adaptive penalties/rewards based on bin size.

Scale bonuses/penalties by item size and bin capacity. Directly incorporate bin capacity ratio.

The improved code refines good fit, targets fullness, and scales "almost full" dynamically.

Consider bin capacity ratio, target fullness, and scaling factors based on item and bin sizes.

Focus on relative wasted space, bin occupancy targets, and targeted bonuses; avoid excessive rules.

Focus on relative wasted space, target fullness, and prioritize near-full bins based on maximum capacity.

Focus on relative wasted space, penalize large gaps, reward tight fits, and simplify scaling.
