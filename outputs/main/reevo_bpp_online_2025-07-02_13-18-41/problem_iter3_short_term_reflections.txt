The better code prioritizes perfect and almost-perfect fits, while strongly penalizing infeasible and worst fits.

Prioritize fitting. Invert wasted space. Penalize near-full bins. Small items prefer low occupancy.

Consider feasibility, fragmentation, near-full bins, and exact fits with appropriate penalties/bonuses.

Prioritize filling bins; linearly penalize remaining space, avoid near-full bins, and prevent infeasibility.

Prioritize tight fits using inverse waste. Explicitly penalize bins that cannot fit.

The better code uses negative infinity for infeasibility, prioritizes best fit directly, and balances fillness, avoiding fragmentation.

Better code uses relative remaining capacity and item size for "good fit" prioritization, and tie-breaking noise.

Prioritize filling bins, avoid fragmentation, reward near-full/exact fits, and ensure feasibility checks.

Prioritize near-perfect fits and filling bins well. Balance packing density with leaving usable space.

Quantify "good fit" explicitly. Penalize infeasible solutions directly. Use relative measures to avoid size bias.
