Scale thresholds and rewards relative to bin capacity. Increase the "almost full" bonus.

Scaling wasted space by *remaining* capacity, adaptive thresholds, and bonus values improve performance.

Scale penalties/rewards by bin size. Refine target fullness bonus and almost-full bin definition for better performance.

Scaling wasted space, target fullness, and almost-fullness thresholds relative to bin capacity improves performance.

Scale wasted space, target fullness, and almost full thresholds relative to bin sizes for better performance.

Scale features relative to bin capacity. Tune bonus/penalty magnitudes. Avoid unnecessary `max_cap` calculations.

Local normalization, tuned target fullness, and adjusted "almost full" thresholds improve bin packing.

Prioritize relative metrics, scale bonuses based on `max_cap`, and significantly reward almost-full bins.

Relative wasted space, target fullness bonuses, and almost-full bin prioritization are key improvements.

The better code prioritizes relative wasted space, target fullness bonus, and almost-full bins, with scaled noise.
