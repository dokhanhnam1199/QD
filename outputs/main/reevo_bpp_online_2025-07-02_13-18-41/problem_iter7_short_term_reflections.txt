Prioritize filling bins, penalize fragmentation, and adapt penalties based on item/bin sizes.

Clear thresholds, focused rewards/penalties based on ratios, and adaptive scaling improve bin packing heuristics.

Focus on tight-fit rewards, gap penalties, fill-level adaptation, and infeasibility handling.

Focus on reward/penalty scaling, thresholds, and adaptive strategies based on fill level.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize waste and fragmentation, and use targeted penalties/bonuses with small noise.

The better code uses tight-fit prioritization, gap penalties, near-full rewards, and adaptive bonuses based on bin utilization.

Prioritize infeasibility, use ratios/adaptive factors, and add noise for tie-breaking.

Prioritize relative waste, reward near-full bins, and penalize extremes in occupancy.

Focus on relative wasted space, bin occupancy, and prioritize nearly full bins. Add noise for tie-breaking.

Relative wasted space, occupancy penalties, and targeted bonuses improve bin packing heuristics. Adding noise helps break ties.
