[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` implements a "Best Fit" heuristic using a sigmoid function. It prioritizes bins where `remaining_capacity` is close to `item` size. The reflection suggests combining "best fit" with "scarcity" using a unified score and tuning weights and Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation.

"Scarcity" in this context can be interpreted as preferring bins that are less full (i.e., have more remaining capacity) when the "fit" is not perfectly tight, or when multiple bins offer a similar "tight fit." This can help keep bins with more remaining capacity available for potentially larger future items.

Let's define "scarcity" score. A simple measure of scarcity for a bin could be its remaining capacity. Bins with higher remaining capacity are "more scarce" in the sense that they have more space available.

We need to combine a "fit score" (like the current sigmoid score) and a "scarcity score." A linear combination is a common approach:
`unified_score = w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity_score`

Here, `fit_score` is the sigmoid score from `priority_v1`.
`scarcity_score` can be `bins_remain_cap` itself, possibly normalized.

The reflection also mentions "Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation." Softmax is typically used to convert scores into probabilities. A temperature parameter `T` can be introduced:
`probabilities = softmax(unified_score / T)`
A high `T` leads to more uniform probabilities (exploration), while a low `T` leads to probabilities concentrated on the highest score (exploitation).

Let's refine the components:

1.  **Fit Score:** The sigmoid function `1 / (1 + exp(k * (remaining_capacity - item)))` is good for penalizing larger mismatches. It needs to be applied only to suitable bins. For bins where `remaining_capacity < item`, the fit score should be 0.

2.  **Scarcity Score:** A direct measure of remaining capacity (`bins_remain_cap`) is suitable. We might want to normalize this, or scale it appropriately relative to the fit score. Let's consider `bins_remain_cap` directly for now.

3.  **Combining Scores:**
    `unified_score_per_bin = w_fit * sigmoid_fit_score + w_scarcity * remaining_capacity`
    This needs to be calculated only for suitable bins. For unsuitable bins, the unified score should effectively be negative infinity so they are not chosen.

4.  **Softmax Temperature:** After calculating unified scores for all bins (with a very low score for unsuitable ones), we can apply softmax. However, the prompt asks for a priority *score*, not probabilities directly. Usually, the highest score is picked. If we were to use Softmax for selection *probabilities*, we would need `T`. If we are just returning scores, we can directly return the unified scores and let an external mechanism pick the max. The reflection mentions "tunable weights and Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation." This implies we might be *using* these scores in a way that exploration/exploitation is controlled. For the purpose of *generating* priority scores, directly returning the weighted sum is more aligned with typical heuristic design, unless the intention is to directly sample from a distribution derived from these scores.

    Let's stick to generating scores. The "adaptive exploration/exploitation" part might relate to *how* these weights (`w_fit`, `w_scarcity`) and the "temperature" (which influences the *spread* of scores) are tuned over time, rather than being part of the score calculation itself. However, if we interpret "Softmax temperature" as a parameter that influences the *shape* of the priority landscape, we could potentially apply a transformation like `score / T` before selecting the max, or use it in a Softmax-like probability calculation.

    For now, let's focus on combining the scores linearly and making the combined score reflect both "best fit" and "scarcity."

    *   **Bin Suitability:** Bins with `remaining_capacity < item` must have a score that ensures they are never picked. A score of `-infinity` or a very large negative number would work.
    *   **Fit Score:** `sigmoid_score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (remaining_capacity - item)))` for suitable bins. This score is between 0 and 1, peaking at 0.5 for a perfect fit. Higher values are better.
    *   **Scarcity Score:** `scarcity = remaining_capacity`. Higher is better (more scarce = more remaining space).

    Let's redefine the combination:
    `score = w_fit * sigmoid_score + w_scarcity * scarcity`

    We need to consider the scaling. `sigmoid_score` is [0, 1]. `scarcity` can be much larger.
    It might be better to normalize `scarcity` or use a scaled version.
    Alternatively, we can think of this as a multi-objective problem.

    The reflection also mentions "Simplify for clarity and robustness." The current sigmoid calculation is mostly robust.

    Let's try a combination where:
    - If `remaining_capacity < item`, score = -infinity.
    - If `remaining_capacity >= item`:
        - Calculate `mismatch = remaining_capacity - item`.
        - Calculate `fit_contribution = 1 / (1 + exp(k * mismatch))` (higher for smaller mismatch).
        - Calculate `scarcity_contribution = remaining_capacity` (higher for more capacity).
        - `unified_score = w_fit * fit_contribution + w_scarcity * scarcity_contribution`.

    The weights `w_fit` and `w_scarcity` will control the trade-off.
    If `w_fit` is high and `w_scarcity` is low, it's close to Best Fit.
    If `w_fit` is low and `w_scarcity` is high, it's close to First Fit Increasing (preferring bins with more space).

    Consider the "Softmax temperature" aspect again. If we want to use it for adaptive selection, we'd typically have a set of *log probabilities* or *logits*.
    Let `logit = w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity_score`.
    Then `probabilities = exp(logit / T) / sum(exp(logit_i / T))`.
    However, the function signature asks for priority *scores*. The most direct interpretation of "unified score" is the weighted sum. The "Softmax temperature" might be an external parameter controlling *how* these scores are used (e.g., in a sampling strategy), rather than being directly incorporated into the score calculation itself. If it were to be incorporated to shape the *score distribution*, we could perhaps apply `score = (w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity_score) / T`, but this makes higher scores *less* distinguished. A more common approach is `score = w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity_score`, and then `probabilities = softmax(score / T)`.

    Let's implement the weighted sum as the primary "unified score." The "Softmax temperature" aspect is hard to integrate directly into a score function that is meant to be maximized. Perhaps the reflection implies that the weights themselves should be tuned, and a separate mechanism (like softmax with temperature) would *use* these scores.

    Let's define the function to return the weighted sum for suitable bins, and a very low score for unsuitable bins.
    The parameter `k` from `priority_v1` controls the "tightness" preference. Let's keep it.
    We introduce `w_fit` and `w_scarcity`.

    Example scenario:
    Item size = 5.
    Bins: [10, 7, 12]
    Remaining capacities: `bins_remain_cap = [10, 7, 12]`

    Bin 0: cap=10. Mismatch=5. Sigmoid=1/(1+exp(k*5)). Scarcity=10.
    Bin 1: cap=7. Mismatch=2. Sigmoid=1/(1+exp(k*2)). Scarcity=7.
    Bin 2: cap=12. Mismatch=7. Sigmoid=1/(1+exp(k*7)). Scarcity=12.

    Let k=5.
    Sigmoid for mismatch 2: 1/(1+exp(5*2)) = 1/(1+exp(10)) approx 0.
    Sigmoid for mismatch 5: 1/(1+exp(5*5)) = 1/(1+exp(25)) approx 0.
    Sigmoid for mismatch 7: 1/(1+exp(5*7)) = 1/(1+exp(35)) approx 0.

    This shows that the sigmoid as-is might become too steep, mapping all reasonable mismatches to near-zero scores. Let's reconsider the sigmoid's role or the `k` value.
    The prompt says "highest priority score". The sigmoid score is *higher* for *tighter* fits.
    `k * (remaining_capacity - item)`
    If `remaining_capacity = item`, mismatch=0, score=0.5.
    If `remaining_capacity = item + epsilon`, mismatch=epsilon, score is slightly < 0.5.
    If `remaining_capacity = item + large_value`, mismatch=large, score approaches 0.
    So, larger mismatch leads to lower score. This is correct for "tight fit".

    The problem might be the scaling when combining with `remaining_capacity`.
    Let's normalize `remaining_capacity` to be in a similar range as the fit score.
    Or, consider the *inverse* of remaining capacity for scarcity? "Less remaining capacity means more scarce"? No, that's counter-intuitive. Higher remaining capacity = more scarce.

    Let's try normalizing `remaining_capacity` by the maximum possible capacity or the maximum remaining capacity currently available.
    Or, we can adjust the weights carefully.

    Alternative approach for "scarcity": Maybe it refers to the *number* of bins available. If there are few bins, we should be more conservative. But this is an online problem, so the number of bins grows dynamically.

    Let's go back to the reflection: "Combine "best fit" with "scarcity" using a unified score. Tune weights and Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation. Simplify for clarity and robustness."

    Focus on the "unified score":
    `score_i = w_fit * best_fit_score_i + w_scarcity * scarcity_score_i`
    Where `best_fit_score_i` is the sigmoid score for bin `i`.
    `scarcity_score_i` is `bins_remain_cap[i]`.

    The issue with direct summation is scale.
    Maybe the scarcity component should also be bounded or scaled.
    What if scarcity is `remaining_capacity / bin_capacity_limit`? Assuming `bin_capacity_limit` is known. If not, we can use the maximum capacity encountered so far, or the maximum capacity of the current item's bin if it fits perfectly.

    Let's assume a `bin_capacity_limit` is implicitly understood or passed. If not, we can dynamically scale based on the current `bins_remain_cap` values.
    Let `max_current_cap = np.max(bins_remain_cap)`.
    Then `normalized_scarcity = bins_remain_cap / max_current_cap` (avoiding division by zero if all are zero).

    Let's refine the score calculation:
    1.  Initialize `priorities` array with a very low value (e.g., `-np.inf`).
    2.  Identify suitable bins (`bins_remain_cap >= item`).
    3.  For suitable bins:
        a.  Calculate `mismatch = bins_remain_cap[suitable_mask] - item`.
        b.  Calculate `fit_score = 1 / (1 + np.exp(k * mismatch))` (use capping for robustness).
        c.  Calculate `scarcity_score`. Let's try a simple scaling: `scarcity = bins_remain_cap[suitable_mask]`. To make it comparable to `fit_score` (0-1 range), we might need to scale it. If we don't scale, `w_scarcity` needs to be very small.
        Let's try without scaling for now and rely on weights.
        d.  `unified_score = w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity`.
        e.  Store `unified_score` in `priorities[suitable_mask]`.

    What about the "Softmax temperature" and "adaptive exploration/exploitation"?
    This suggests the function might be part of a larger system where these parameters are adjusted. If the function *itself* needs to incorporate them:
    `score = (w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity_score) / T`
    This would mean that with higher temperature, scores become closer, encouraging exploration (less greedy choices). With lower temperature, scores become more spread out, encouraging exploitation (greedier choices).
    This interpretation seems plausible for "adaptive exploration/exploitation".

    Let's implement this:
    `unified_score_raw = w_fit * fit_score + w_scarcity * scarcity_score`
    `final_priority_score = unified_score_raw / T`

    We need to define `k`, `w_fit`, `w_scarcity`, and `T`. These are hyperparameters.
    Let's choose some initial values.
    `k`: controls fit sensitivity. Let's keep it around 5.0.
    `w_fit`: weight for best fit. Let's say 1.0.
    `w_scarcity`: weight for remaining capacity. Let's say 0.1 to start, as capacity can be large.
    `T`: temperature for exploration. Let's say 1.0 for baseline (no explicit temperature effect).

    The reflection also mentioned "Simplify for clarity and robustness."
    The sigmoid calculation already has capping.
    The unified score calculation is a linear combination.

    Let's ensure the output is a numpy array of priorities. Unsuitable bins should have a very low priority.

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Combines Best Fit and Scarcity for online Bin Packing priority.

        This heuristic prioritizes bins based on a unified score that balances:
        1. Best Fit: How closely the bin's remaining capacity matches the item size.
           Prioritizes bins where `remaining_capacity` is just enough for `item`.
        2. Scarcity: The amount of remaining capacity in the bin.
           Prioritizes bins with more remaining capacity (less "full").

        The unified score is a weighted sum of a sigmoid-based fit score and the
        bin's remaining capacity. A temperature parameter is introduced to control
        the exploration/exploitation trade-off when converting these scores to
        selection probabilities (though this function returns the raw scores).

        Args:
            item: The size of the item to be packed.

    ```
    The reflection mentioned combining "best fit" with "scarcity". The current implementation does this via a weighted sum.
    It also mentions "Tune weights and Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation." The weights (`w_fit`, `w_scarcity`) and `temperature` are exposed hyperparameters. The interpretation of temperature scaling the unified score is a plausible way to link it to exploration/exploitation if the scores are later used in a Softmax-like selection mechanism.
    "Simplify for clarity and robustness." The sigmoid calculation is made more robust with capping. The linear combination is clear.

    Let's consider the constraints on `bins_remain_cap` and `item`. They are floats. Capacities are usually positive. Item size should also be positive.
    The initialisation of `priorities` to `-np.inf` is robust as it ensures any valid calculated score will be preferred over an unsuitable bin.

    Final check on the interpretation of temperature: If the scores are directly used (e.g., argmax), dividing by T might not directly map to exploration. However, if these scores are used as inputs to a Softmax function `P(bin_i) = exp(score_i / T) / sum(exp(score_j / T))`, then indeed `T` controls exploration. Given the prompt asks for "priority scores," and the reflection *mentions* Softmax temperature, scaling the scores by `1/T` is a reasonable attempt to embed this concept into the score itself, making the scores more sensitive to differences (low T) or less sensitive (high T).

    Let's consider the relative scaling of `w_fit` and `w_scarcity` again.
    `sigmoid_fit_scores` are in range (0, 1]. Max is 1 (for mismatch 0). Min can be close to 0.
    `scarcity_scores` are `suitable_bins_cap`, which can be any positive value.
    If `w_fit=1` and `w_scarcity=0.05`, then a `scarcity_score` of 20 would contribute `0.05 * 20 = 1.0`, comparable to the best possible fit score. This seems like a reasonable starting point for balancing.

    One potential simplification: The reflection says "Simplify for clarity". If the goal is just to combine them, maybe a simpler scarcity measure or normalization could be used. However, `remaining_capacity` is the most direct measure.

    The output should be Python code. The current structure is correct.
    The reflection also asked to combine "best fit" with "scarcity". The weighted sum does this.
    The original `priority_v1` only did Best Fit. `priority_v2` adds Scarcity.

    One last check: The problem is "online Bin Packing Problem (BPP)". The heuristic needs to select a bin for an item *as soon as it is received*. This means the `bins_remain_cap` array represents the current state. The heuristic does exactly this.

    Is there a way to make the sigmoid "simpler"? The current one is standard. The capping adds robustness.

    Let's consider the prompt's output requirement: "Output Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: ```python ... ```".
    The current code block adheres to this.

    The reflection mentions "adaptive exploration/exploitation". This is the trickiest part to integrate directly into a score function without knowing how the scores are used. By scaling `unified_score_raw / T`, we influence the relative magnitudes of scores. If a selection mechanism uses `argmax`, then dividing by `T` makes the choice more greedy for small `T` and more random for large `T`. This is a plausible interpretation.

    Let's ensure all imports are present. `numpy` is needed.
    The function signature matches. The return type is correct.
    The docstring explains the logic.

    Consider edge cases:
    - `bins_remain_cap` is empty: `num_bins` would be 0, `np.any` would be False, returns `np.array([], dtype=float)`. Correct.
    - `item` is very large, larger than any `bins_remain_cap`: `suitable_bins_mask` would be all False, returns `np.full(num_bins, -np.inf, dtype=float)`. Correct.
    - `temperature` is zero or negative: Added a guard `if temperature <= 0`.

    The code seems complete and addresses the reflection points as interpreted.
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Combines Best Fit and Scarcity for online Bin Packing priority.

        This heuristic prioritizes bins based on a unified score that balances:
        1. Best Fit: How closely the bin's remaining capacity matches the item size.
           Prioritizes bins where `remaining_capacity` is just enough for `item`.
           This is modeled using a sigmoid function: `1 / (1 + exp(k * (capacity - item)))`.
           Higher scores indicate a better fit (smaller `capacity - item`).
        2. Scarcity: The amount of remaining capacity in the bin.
           Prioritizes bins with more remaining capacity, as they might accommodate
           larger future items. This is modeled directly by the bin's remaining capacity.

        The unified score is a weighted sum of these two components. The weights (`w_fit`,
        `w_scarcity`) control the trade-off. A temperature parameter (`temperature`)
        is used to scale these scores, influencing the spread and thus the effective
        "greediness" or "exploratory" nature of the selection when these scores are used
        in a probabilistic context (like Softmax).
