Prioritize "good fits" with softmax; explore randomly only sparingly.
Prioritize bins that minimize remaining capacity after placing an item for tighter packing.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity after packing for better bin utilization.
Prioritize exact fits and near-exact fits for tighter packing. Softmax captures this preference effectively.
Prioritize tight fits, explore options wisely, and tune parameters for optimal performance.
Normalize scores for better epsilon-greedy. Explore less often with better scoring.
Prioritize tight fits first, then earlier bins for tie-breaking.
Prioritize tighter fits, consider softmax for smooth distribution, tune temperature for exploration.
Focus on direct "best fit" metrics, avoid unnecessary exploration for simple heuristics.
Prioritize good fits, but explore random suitable bins with a small, consistent exploration score.
