Focus on simplicity, exploitability, and adaptive exploration for better heuristics.
1. **Smooth Selection:** Softmax offers smoother transitions than strict epsilon-greedy.
2. **Tunable Exploration:** Temperature parameter in softmax provides fine-grained control.
3. **Focus on Fit:** Prioritize bins with minimal wasted space for better packing.
4. **Unified Scoring:** Softmax converts scores into probabilities for selection.
Balance fit, scarcity, and exploration with tunable parameters.
Prioritize exact fits. Use smooth decay for near-fits. Softmax normalizes.
Incorporate multiple objectives and probabilistic selection for better bin packing heuristics.
Prioritize exact fits, then small positive gaps. Explore randomly sometimes.
Emphasize tight fits, explore diverse options, and use a probabilistic approach like softmax.
Prioritize tight fits, use temperature for exploration/exploitation balance.
Prioritize tight fits and consider scarcity; simplify scoring and use temperature for exploration.
Prioritize tight fits, consider early bins, and balance exploration with exploitation.
