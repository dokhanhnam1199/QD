Focus on "tight fits" and use softmax for probabilistic exploration.
Prioritize tight fits, then earlier bins for First Fit. Minimize waste and index.
Prioritize tight fits; explore with softmax; consider bin scarcity.
Better heuristics often use:
- Probabilistic exploration (like Softmax)
- Metrics reflecting "good fits" or minimizing waste
Prioritize good fits, but explore randomly. Softmax excels for diverse fits.
Prioritize tight fits; minimize wasted space for better packing. Explore diversification strategically.
Prioritize bins with minimal remaining capacity *beyond* item size.
Prioritize exact fits, smooth preferences with a decay, and use Softmax for balanced probabilities.
Prioritize minimal remaining capacity after placement; explore to avoid local optima.
The better heuristic uses a sigmoid to reward bins that are a "good fit," avoiding exploration bias.
