Focus on precise weighting of fit and scarcity. Experiment with score normalization and temperature effects.
1.  **Combine heuristics:** Blend multiple factors for robustness.
2.  **Probabilistic selection:** Use Softmax for exploration.
3.  **Data-driven tuning:** Adjust weights and parameters.
4.  **Clear logic:** Avoid complex conditional returns for clarity.
1.  **Combine "best fit" with "scarcity" for a richer score.**
2.  **Use Softmax for exploration, balancing greediness and variety.**
3.  **Tune weights and temperature based on performance.**
Simplicity, clear objectives, and occasional exploration often lead to better heuristics.
Focus on clear objectives, simple scoring, and controlled exploration.
Prioritize exact fits, use smooth decay, and enable tunable exploration via Softmax.
Balance exploitation (tight fits) with exploration (diverse bin choices).
Focus on "tight fits" and explore parameterization for adaptable behavior.
Simplify. Focus on the core problem. Remove complex, less impactful features.
Prioritize tight fits, then scarcity. Use Softmax for controlled exploration/exploitation.
