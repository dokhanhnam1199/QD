[Prior reflection]
The current `priority_v1` implements a "best fit" heuristic by favoring bins where the remaining capacity is closest to the item size. It uses a sigmoid function to assign higher scores to smaller "mismatches" (remaining capacity - item size).

The reflection suggests combining "best fit" with "scarcity" and using a unified score, with tunable weights and Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation.

"Scarcity" can be interpreted as favoring bins that are less full, meaning they have larger remaining capacities. This is somewhat counter-intuitive to "best fit" which favors bins with *just enough* capacity. However, in an online setting, reserving larger bins for potentially larger future items might be beneficial.

Let's consider how to combine these:
1.  **Best Fit component:** The sigmoid function in `priority_v1` already captures this. A higher score for smaller `remaining_capacity - item`.
2.  **Scarcity component:** This could mean favoring bins with *larger* `remaining_capacity`. A simple way to represent this is to directly use `remaining_capacity` or a scaled version of it.
3.  **Unified Score:** We can create a weighted sum of these components.
    `Score = w_bf * BestFit_Score + w_sc * Scarcity_Score`
    The weights `w_bf` and `w_sc` would control the balance.
4.  **Softmax for Exploration/Exploitation:** After computing scores for all suitable bins, Softmax can be applied to convert these scores into probabilities. This allows for a trade-off:
    *   Low temperature: Deterministic (close to greedy "best" choice).
    *   High temperature: More exploration (closer to uniform random choice among suitable bins).

Let's refine the components:

*   **Best Fit Score:** The sigmoid `1 / (1 + exp(k * (remaining_capacity - item)))` works well. Let's call this `bf_score`. A high `bf_score` means a good fit.
*   **Scarcity Score:** We want to favor bins with *more* remaining capacity. So, `remaining_capacity` itself is a good indicator. However, raw capacity might not be directly comparable to the sigmoid score. We can normalize it or apply a transformation. A simple approach is to use `remaining_capacity` directly, but scaled. Let's try a linear scaling or a simple transformation. Or, we could use a sigmoid on the capacity itself, but inverted, so larger capacities get higher scores. For example, `1 / (1 + exp(-k_sc * remaining_capacity))`. This would give higher scores to bins with more capacity. Let's call this `sc_score`.

Let's redefine the problem slightly to fit the reflection's prompt better. The prompt asks for a priority function that returns a score for *each* bin. The selection logic (like Softmax) is usually applied *after* getting these raw scores. So, `priority_v2` should output the raw scores before Softmax.

Let's define the score components for a suitable bin `i` with `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:

1.  **Best Fit (BF) component:** We want a higher score when `bins_remain_cap[i] - item` is small.
    `bf_component = - (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)`  (Higher score for smaller positive difference)
    To make it resemble the sigmoid behavior and handle large differences gracefully, we can still use the sigmoid idea, but perhaps map it differently.
    Let's re-evaluate the sigmoid: `1 / (1 + exp(k * (R - I)))`.
    When `R=I`, score=0.5. When `R > I`, score < 0.5. Smaller `R-I` gives score closer to 0.5.
    This is good. Let's stick with this formulation for the BF score, but maybe add a constant offset to ensure it's always positive if needed.
    `bf_score = sigmoid(k * (item - bins_remain_cap[i]))`  (Using `item - R` means smaller difference is closer to 0, `exp(0)=1`, score 0.5. Larger `R-I` means more negative `item-R`, more negative exponent, `exp` closer to 0, score closer to 1. This is reversed.
    Let's go back to `k * (R - I)`. A smaller `R-I` (good fit) means smaller exponent (closer to 0), `exp` closer to 1, score closer to 0.5. Larger `R-I` means larger exponent, `exp` larger, score closer to 0.
    So `bf_score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`. This is correct. Higher score means better fit.

2.  **Scarcity (SC) component:** We want higher scores for bins with *larger* remaining capacity.
    Let's use a scaled version of the remaining capacity.
    `sc_component = bins_remain_cap[i]`
    To make it comparable to the BF score (which is between 0 and 1), we might need to normalize or transform `bins_remain_cap[i]`.
    A simple transformation could be `tanh(bins_remain_cap[i] / scale)`. `tanh` maps values to (-1, 1). If we want positive scores, maybe `(tanh(...) + 1) / 2` or just scale it.
    Alternatively, we can use a logistic function again, but for capacity: `sigmoid(k_sc * bins_remain_cap[i])`. This gives higher scores for larger capacities. Let's use this.
    `sc_score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k_sc * bins_remain_cap[i]))`

3.  **Unified Score:**
    `Unified_Score = w_bf * bf_score + w_sc * sc_score`
    The weights `w_bf` and `w_sc` would control the trade-off.
    Let's set `w_bf = 1.0` and `w_sc = 0.5` as an example.
    The parameters `k` (for BF) and `k_sc` (for SC) need tuning. Let's keep `k=5.0` as before. Let `k_sc = 0.1` (assuming capacities are not excessively large).

Let's think about the selection step. If we use Softmax `P(bin_i) = exp(score_i / T) / sum(exp(score_j / T))`, then the `score_i` should be scaled appropriately. The unified score is already a sum, so it's fine.

The function should return the *priority scores* for each bin. The Softmax would be applied externally if needed.

Revised approach for `priority_v2`:
For each bin `i`:
- If `bins_remain_cap[i] < item`, priority = 0.
- If `bins_remain_cap[i] >= item`:
    - Calculate Best Fit score: `bf_score = 1 / (1 + exp(k * (bins_remain_cap[i] - item)))`
    - Calculate Scarcity score: `sc_score = 1 / (1 + exp(-k_sc * bins_remain_cap[i]))`
    - Calculate Unified score: `unified_score = w_bf * bf_score + w_sc * sc_score`
    - Assign `priority[i] = unified_score`

Parameters:
`k`: Controls steepness of best-fit preference. Higher `k` means stronger preference for tighter fits.
`k_sc`: Controls steepness of scarcity preference. Higher `k_sc` means stronger preference for larger capacities.
`w_bf`, `w_sc`: Weights for combining the two components.

Example values:
`k = 5.0`
`k_sc = 0.1`
`w_bf = 1.0`
`w_sc = 0.5`

Consider numerical stability:
The `bf_score` calculation is similar to `v1`, so the capping of `exp` argument is still relevant.
The `sc_score` involves `exp(-k_sc * bins_remain_cap[i])`. If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is very large and `k_sc` is positive, the exponent becomes very negative. `exp` of a large negative number approaches 0. This is good, as `sc_score` will approach `1/(1+0) = 1`. If `bins_remain_cap[i]` is very small (close to 0) and `k_sc` is positive, the exponent is close to 0, `exp(0)=1`, `sc_score` is 0.5. This seems stable.

Let's structure the code.

```python
import numpy as np

    """

    return priorities

```
Final check on the reflection points:
- Combine "best fit" with "scarcity": Yes, using `bf_scores` and `sc_scores` in a weighted sum.
- Unified score: Yes, `unified_scores`.
- Tune weights and Softmax temperature for adaptive exploration/exploitation: Weights (`w_bf`, `w_sc`) are tunable. Softmax temperature is not part of the `priority` function itself but would be applied externally to the returned scores if probabilistic selection is desired. The parameters `k_bf` and `k_sc` tune the shape of the individual heuristics, influencing exploration/exploitation implicitly.
- Simplify for clarity and robustness: The code is structured logically. Numerical stability for `np.exp` is handled by capping the argument. Variable names are descriptive.

The prompt asks for the function `priority_v2` that returns the priority scores. The implementation seems correct according to the refined reflection.
