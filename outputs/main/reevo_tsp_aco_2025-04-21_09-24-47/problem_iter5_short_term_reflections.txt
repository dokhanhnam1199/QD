Combining diverse, problem-aware heuristics with adaptive sparsification improves TSP solution sampling.

Incorporate nearest neighbors, node degree, and adaptive sparsification. Normalize for probabilistic interpretation.

Prioritize node degree effectively, add controlled noise, sparsify per node, and maintain symmetry for improvements.

Sparsification, adaptive thresholds, nearest neighbors, and degree penalties improve TSP heuristic performance.

Symmetry, node-specific sparsification, weighted combination of factors, and exploration via noise improve heuristic quality.

Adaptive sparsification, randomness, normalization, and combined heuristics improve TSP solution sampling.

Prioritize nearest neighbors, adaptive k-sparsification, and avoid excessive degree penalties for improved exploration.

Adaptive sparsification, normalization, and edge combination with slight randomness improve heuristic quality.

Rank-based sparsification, node importance, and adaptive `k` improve exploration-exploitation balance in TSP heuristics.

Consider adaptive sparsification, global connectivity, and node degree for improved heuristic guidance.
