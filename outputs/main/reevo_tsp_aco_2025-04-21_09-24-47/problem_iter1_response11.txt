def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Heuristic function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a combination of factors
    to estimate the "promise" of including each edge in the optimal tour.  It also sparsifies
    the matrix by zeroing out unpromising edges.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A 2D numpy array representing the distance matrix
                                       between cities. distance_matrix[i][j] gives the distance
                                       between city i and city j.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A 2D numpy array of the same shape as distance_matrix, where each element
                    represents the heuristic value (promise) of including the corresponding edge
                    in the TSP tour. Higher values indicate a more promising edge.
