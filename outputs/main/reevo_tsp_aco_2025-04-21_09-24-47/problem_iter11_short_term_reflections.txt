Savings heuristic improvement, simplified sparsification, adjusted cycle prevention, and balanced heuristic weights are key.

Prioritize core components (distance, degree, connectivity), adaptive sparsification, and row normalization for probabilities.

Leverage node degree, refined sparsification, and efficient MST for improved TSP heuristic design.

Adding a savings heuristic and reducing cycle prevention strength improved performance.

Consider nearest neighbors, MST, degree, cycle prevention, and path relinking with adaptive sparsification and normalization.

Normalization matters. Cycle prevention and path relinking can improve performance, but require careful tuning.

Diversify heuristics, tune weights adaptively, and scale sparsification with problem size for improved TSP solutions.

Better heuristics: Normalize inputs, use `minimum_spanning_tree`, adaptive k, and node degree penalty.

Adaptive cycle prevention and clipping probabilities improve heuristic performance.

Adaptive weights, randomness in sparsification, and robust normalization improve heuristic performance.
