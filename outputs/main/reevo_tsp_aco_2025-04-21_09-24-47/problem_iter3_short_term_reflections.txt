The better code uses simpler, more direct metrics like inverse distance and node degree, improving efficiency. Sparsification is also simplified.

Prioritize node degree, shortest edges, and dynamic sparsification based on distance for improved exploration.

Consider centrality, normalize effectively, and sparsify based on neighbor count instead of quantiles.

The better code incorporates node importance and percentile-based sparsification, improving edge selection.

The better code leverages node importance and aggressive sparsification, unlike the degree-based penalty and average-distance thresholding in the worse code.

Prioritize node degree, add noise, sparsify by node, and ensure symmetry for better TSP heuristics.

Incorporate global connectivity, adaptive sparsification, and node degree informed by neighbor count for better heuristics.

The better code uses percentile-based sparsification, balances node connections, and enforces symmetry, improving exploration.

Better code: Focus on fewer neighbors, weighted averaging, instance-adaptive sparsification, and normalization for probabilities.

Better heuristic: inverse distance, node importance, percentile thresholding, avoids zero division.
Consider adaptive thresholds, edge combination strategies, and learning from past solutions.
