def heuristics_v2(distance_matrix: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Heuristic function for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a combination of factors.

    This version incorporates the following ideas:
    1. Inverse distance: Shorter distances are generally more promising.
    2. Node degree: Avoid edges that would lead to high-degree nodes early in the tour.
    3. Sparsification: Set unpromising elements (high distances) to zero using percentile.
    4. Encourage inclusion of edges connected to nodes that are far apart to create a more balanced initial graph.
    5. Symmetry: Enforce symmetry in the heuristic matrix.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): A square matrix representing the distances between cities.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A matrix of the same shape as distance_matrix, where each element
                      indicates the "promise" of including the corresponding edge in a solution.
