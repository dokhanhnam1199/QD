    """
    Heuristic function for TSP using a combination of diverse factors, adaptive sparsification,
    and edge combination strategies. This version adaptively adjusts the combination
    weights and sparsification based on problem size and incorporates Clarke-Wright savings.

    Args:
        distance_matrix (np.ndarray): Distance matrix representing the TSP instance.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Prior indicators (probabilities) of edge inclusion.
