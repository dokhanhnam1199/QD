Prioritize nearest neighbors, MST approximation, adaptive sparsification, and heuristic combination with careful weighting.

Simplicity, adaptive sparsification using percentiles, and controlled randomness can improve TSP heuristic performance.

Incorporate diverse, normalized heuristics (distance, neighbors, MST, degree). Adapt sparsification, add exploration noise, and ensure symmetry.

Diversify heuristics (MST, NN), adapt sparsification (sqrt(n)), and tune combination weights for improvement.

Consider global connectivity, adaptive sparsification, and combined metrics tailored to TSP characteristics for better performance.

The better code incorporates MST, logarithmic nearest neighbor scaling, and adjusted heuristic weights for improved performance.

Prioritize degree-based heuristics with adaptive sparsification and controlled noise injection for exploration.

The better code uses multiple heuristics, MST approximation, adaptive sparsification, and exploration noise with careful normalization.

Combining diverse heuristics (distance, neighbors, MST), adaptive sparsification, and noise injection improves exploration.

Adaptive sparsification, normalization, and combining relevant heuristics factors focusing on node properties improves performance.
