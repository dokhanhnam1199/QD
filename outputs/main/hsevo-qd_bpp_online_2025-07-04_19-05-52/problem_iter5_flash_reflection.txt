**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic incorporates several factors (fill ratio, existing fill, gap penalty, near-perfect fit bonus, and clipping) to prioritize bin selection, while the worst only considers the log of the fill ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst) The 2nd best code block is the same as the best code block. The second worst code block is the same as the worst code block. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th) again, they are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see they are identical. Overall: The best heuristics consider multiple factors and tunable parameters to optimize bin selection, while the worst performing heuristics oversimplify the bin selection process using just the fill ratio. More complex heuristics generally perform better, provided the weighting and parameters are appropriately tuned.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and allow for tunable parameters. Start with a broader range of factors and iteratively refine based on performance. Prioritize heuristics that directly address the core problem constraints and objectives.
