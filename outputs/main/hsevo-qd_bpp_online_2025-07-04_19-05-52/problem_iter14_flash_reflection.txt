**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the 1st heuristic incorporates utilization maximization, existing fill bonus, fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit reward, remaining capacity consideration, nearly full bin penalty, look-ahead fragmentation penalty, and scaling/clipping, whereas the 20th uses only a logarithmic ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) highlights that even simplified versions including just fill ratio, existing fill bonus, and gap penalties outperform just fill ratio based approach. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe adjustments to weights (e.g., fill ratio weight, existing fill bonus weight), and the introduction of a "look-ahead fragmentation penalty" in the 1st that is not in 2nd. (3rd) vs (4th) shows no differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that while both are rather basic, the second worst incorporates fill ratio, existing fill, and a small gap penalty, providing more nuance than the raw logarithmic ratios of the worst performing heuristics. Overall: More sophisticated heuristics consider multiple factors (utilization, fragmentation, remaining capacity) with weighted bonuses/penalties, adaptive thresholds, and scaling. Simpler heuristics focus primarily on fill ratio and may only consider rudimentary gap penalties. More parameters give better fine-tuning.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, weight them appropriately, dynamically adjust penalties/rewards, and ensure numerical stability. Start simple, then iteratively add complexity by incorporating additional relevant factors and fine-tuning weights using experimentation.
