Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" for better heuristics design, focusing on actionable advice while avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Problem constraints, objective function, iterative refinement, contextual adaptation, parameter tuning, performance evaluation, simplicity.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple baseline heuristic. Systematically add and refine factors informed by problem constraints and the objective function. Prioritize rigorous performance evaluation after each modification. Contextually adapt parameters.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex initial designs, neglecting baseline performance measurement, insufficient testing of parameter settings, focusing solely on immediate fit instead of long-term impact.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design is an iterative process of building from simple solutions. Continuously evaluate and refine based on performance against the objective function.
