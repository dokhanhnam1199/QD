Okay, I'm ready to refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, keeping in mind the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection". Let's aim for actionable advice, focusing on structured improvement and avoiding premature complexity.

Here's a redefined approach to self-reflection:

*   **Keywords:** Incremental, Empirical, Contextual, Validation.
*   **Advice:** Build heuristics iteratively, validating each addition empirically. Consider the problem's context to guide feature selection.
*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization early on. Blindly adding features without understanding their impact.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a clear understanding of the heuristic's behavior at each step. Start with a basic solution and only add complexity if proven necessary through careful testing and observation. Focus on data-driven decisions for feature engineering and parameter tuning.
