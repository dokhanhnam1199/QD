Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the second best adds bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, and reward for creating bins that can fit a specific \"common size\", while the second worst combines fill ratio, existing fullness, and gap penalty. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the top heuristic lacks bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, and reward for creating bins that can fit a specific \"common size\" compared to the 2nd ranked heuristic. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that the 3rd only focuses on fill ratio, existing fill bonus, fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit reward, and remaining capacity consideration whereas the 4th adds bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, and reward for creating bins that can fit a specific \"common size\". Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst implements fill ratio, existing fullness, and gap penalty but the worst only checks for eligibility before exiting. Overall: Top heuristics incorporate several factors such as fill ratio, fragmentation penalty, existing fill, and near-perfect fit rewards. The more successful heuristics dynamically adjust parameters based on item size and remaining capacity, and scale/clip the final priorities. Less successful heuristics either lack key features or use fixed parameters. Heavily parameterized functions are ranked lower.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine self-reflection for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Objective functions, problem structure, iterative refinement, ablation studies, generalization, adaptability, computational cost, exploration-exploitation balance.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on understanding *why* a heuristic works (or doesn't). Analyze performance across diverse problem instances to identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. Prioritize adaptability and computational efficiency in design.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, reliance on isolated performance metrics, lack of problem structure analysis, and neglecting computational cost.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves deeply understanding the problem, the heuristic's limitations, and how design choices influence generalization and computational efficiency. Iteratively refine based on rigorous analysis and ablation, always questioning the value of added complexity.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
