Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to be more effective in guiding the design of better heuristics, specifically addressing the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection:

**Redefined "Current Self-Reflection":**

*   **Keywords:** Problem Understanding, Iterative Refinement, Targeted Experimentation, Performance Measurement.
*   **Advice:** Focus first on *deeply* understanding the core problem constraints and objectives. Design a simple, understandable baseline heuristic addressing these. Then, iteratively improve based on *measurable* performance gains obtained through *targeted* experiments addressing specific weaknesses.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, untuned parameters, vague "relevant factors," and optimization without clear performance metrics. Resist the urge to add "everything."
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection focuses on a structured approach. Start simple, understand *why* your heuristic fails, and introduce complexity *only* to address those specific failures. Avoid "kitchen sink" heuristics. Prioritize understanding and control over perceived completeness.
