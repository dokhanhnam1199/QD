Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing better packing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.

Here's a redefined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-criteria evaluation, bin utilization, future impact, adaptive weights.
*   **Advice:** Quantify the long-term impact of placement decisions by simulating future packing stages. Dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different criteria (fit, bin utilization, fragmentation) based on real-time performance.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on solely immediate fit; neglecting the cascading effects of early decisions.
*   **Explanation:** Heuristics often get stuck in local optima. By evaluating placement not just on immediate fit but on projected future consequences (bin fragmentation, remaining item sizes), and adaptively tweaking decision criteria weights, we can escape these traps.
