Here's a refined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, emphasizing effectiveness:

*   **Keywords:** Holistic Evaluation, Adaptive Tuning, Constraint Focus, Predictive Awareness.

*   **Advice:** Systematically evaluate the interplay of multiple factors, dynamically adjust heuristic parameters based on observed solution landscapes, and prioritize constraints most critical for optimality.

*   **Avoid:** Narrow focus on immediate gains, static parameter settings, and neglecting long-term consequences of early decisions.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond reactive adjustments to proactive design, considering how current choices impact future solution states and optimizing for overall, long-term performance.
