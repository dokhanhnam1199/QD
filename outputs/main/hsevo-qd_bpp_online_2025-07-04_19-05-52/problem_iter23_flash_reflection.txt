**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic directly implements fill ratio, existing fill bonus, fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit reward, and remaining capacity consideration, while the worst only checks for eligibility. Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), we see that the second best adds bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, and reward for creating bins that can fit a specific "common size", while the second worst combines fill ratio, existing fullness, and gap penalty. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the top heuristic lacks bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, and reward for creating bins that can fit a specific "common size" compared to the 2nd ranked heuristic. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see that the 3rd only focuses on fill ratio, existing fill bonus, fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit reward, and remaining capacity consideration whereas the 4th adds bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, and reward for creating bins that can fit a specific "common size". Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that the second worst implements fill ratio, existing fullness, and gap penalty but the worst only checks for eligibility before exiting. Overall: Top heuristics incorporate several factors such as fill ratio, fragmentation penalty, existing fill, and near-perfect fit rewards. The more successful heuristics dynamically adjust parameters based on item size and remaining capacity, and scale/clip the final priorities. Less successful heuristics either lack key features or use fixed parameters. Heavily parameterized functions are ranked lower.

**Experience:**
Prioritize core objectives (fill ratio, fragmentation). Dynamically adjust parameters based on problem characteristics (item size, bin capacity). Add new features incrementally, evaluating their impact. Avoid over-parameterization; simpler heuristics can be more robust. Feature ablation (removal) is as valuable as addition.
