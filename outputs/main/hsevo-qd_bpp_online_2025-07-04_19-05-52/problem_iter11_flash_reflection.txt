**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach considering utilization, fragmentation, and remaining capacity, while the worst focuses solely on the item-to-bin capacity ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst), the second best employs several bonuses and penalties to improve upon the base fill ratio, whereas the second worst only considers fill ratio, existing fill and gap penalty. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see a focus shift towards adaptive parameterization in the second, like using average item size for fragmentation. (3rd) vs (4th) illustrates that the 4th one incorporates additional adaptive strategies, such as dynamically adjusting the fragmentation penalty. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst combines fill ratio, existing fullness, and gap penalty while the worst only consider the ratio of item size and bins remaining capacity. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize a balanced approach, adapt to problem specifics through dynamic parameters, and implement well-defined penalties and rewards. The worst heuristics lack these considerations, leading to suboptimal bin packing decisions.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors beyond the most obvious. Implement adaptive parameters based on problem context. Fine-tune the weights and thresholds to balance different objectives (e.g., fill ratio vs. fragmentation).
