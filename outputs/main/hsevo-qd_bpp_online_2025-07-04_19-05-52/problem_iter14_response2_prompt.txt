Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Enhanced priority function considering utilization, fragmentation, and future packing.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    eligible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(eligible_bins):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap) - np.inf\n\n    # 1.

(2nd best) vs (second worst) highlights that even simplified versions including just fill ratio, existing fill bonus, and gap penalties outperform just fill ratio based approach. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we observe adjustments to weights (e.g., fill ratio weight, existing fill bonus weight), and the introduction of a \"look-ahead fragmentation penalty\" in the 1st that is not in 2nd. (3rd) vs (4th) shows no differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that while both are rather basic, the second worst incorporates fill ratio, existing fill, and a small gap penalty, providing more nuance than the raw logarithmic ratios of the worst performing heuristics. Overall: More sophisticated heuristics consider multiple factors (utilization, fragmentation, remaining capacity) with weighted bonuses/penalties, adaptive thresholds, and scaling. Simpler heuristics focus primarily on fill ratio and may only consider rudimentary gap penalties. More parameters give better fine-tuning.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to be more effective in guiding the design of better heuristics, specifically addressing the pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection:\n\n**Redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\":**\n\n*   **Keywords:** Problem Understanding, Iterative Refinement, Targeted Experimentation, Performance Measurement.\n*   **Advice:** Focus first on *deeply* understanding the core problem constraints and objectives. Design a simple, understandable baseline heuristic addressing these. Then, iteratively improve based on *measurable* performance gains obtained through *targeted* experiments addressing specific weaknesses.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, untuned parameters, vague \"relevant factors,\" and optimization without clear performance metrics. Resist the urge to add \"everything.\"\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection focuses on a structured approach. Start simple, understand *why* your heuristic fails, and introduce complexity *only* to address those specific failures. Avoid \"kitchen sink\" heuristics. Prioritize understanding and control over perceived completeness.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
