"**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic incorporates a much more complex, multi-faceted approach, considering fill ratio, existing fill, fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit reward, remaining capacity, nearly full bin penalty, look-ahead fragmentation penalty, and half-full bin reward, bin utilization variance penalty, dynamic gap penalty scaling, reward for creating bins with specific common size, and a final scaling/clipping step. The last heuristic uses a simple log ratio calculation.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second heuristic uses a weighted combination of fill ratio, existing fill bonus, and fragmentation penalty. The 19th heuristic uses a simple log ratio calculation.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic has new heuristics like 9. Bin Utilization Variance Penalty, 10. Dynamic Gap Penalty Scaling, 11. Reward for creating bins that can fit a specific "common size", and 12. Scale and Clip and uses more aggressive weights than the second.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd and 4th are nearly identical; they differ only in comments.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see 19th and 20th are nearly identical; both are the same function. Overall: Better heuristics employ multiple factors including fill ratio, fragmentation, remaining capacity, and look-ahead considerations, combining them with carefully tuned weights and adaptive penalties/rewards. They often incorporate scaling/clipping to maintain stability and prevent extreme priority values. Simpler heuristics rely on one or two factors.

**Experience:**
In designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, assign appropriate weights, and include adaptive penalties/rewards to handle diverse scenarios. Incorporate scaling/clipping mechanisms to ensure stability and prevent dominance by individual factors. Look-ahead consideration by consolidate smaller items."
