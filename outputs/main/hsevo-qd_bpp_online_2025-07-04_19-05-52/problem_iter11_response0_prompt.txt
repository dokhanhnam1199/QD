Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins.

(2nd best) vs (second worst), the second best employs several bonuses and penalties to improve upon the base fill ratio, whereas the second worst only considers fill ratio, existing fill and gap penalty. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see a focus shift towards adaptive parameterization in the second, like using average item size for fragmentation. (3rd) vs (4th) illustrates that the 4th one incorporates additional adaptive strategies, such as dynamically adjusting the fragmentation penalty. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the second worst combines fill ratio, existing fullness, and gap penalty while the worst only consider the ratio of item size and bins remaining capacity. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize a balanced approach, adapt to problem specifics through dynamic parameters, and implement well-defined penalties and rewards. The worst heuristics lack these considerations, leading to suboptimal bin packing decisions.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" for better heuristics design, focusing on actionable advice while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Problem constraints, objective function, iterative refinement, contextual adaptation, parameter tuning, performance evaluation, simplicity.\n\n*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple baseline heuristic. Systematically add and refine factors informed by problem constraints and the objective function. Prioritize rigorous performance evaluation after each modification. Contextually adapt parameters.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex initial designs, neglecting baseline performance measurement, insufficient testing of parameter settings, focusing solely on immediate fit instead of long-term impact.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design is an iterative process of building from simple solutions. Continuously evaluate and refine based on performance against the objective function.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
