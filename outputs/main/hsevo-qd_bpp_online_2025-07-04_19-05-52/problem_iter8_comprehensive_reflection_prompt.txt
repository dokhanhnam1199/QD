{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nComplex heuristics require thoughtful feature engineering and tuning. Start with a simple baseline, then iteratively add and refine factors like fragmentation penalties and near-perfect fit bonuses. Adaptive penalties and tunable weights/thresholds significantly improve heuristic performance, but require careful optimization and testing.\nWhen designing heuristics for packing problems, consider multiple factors beyond just the immediate fit. Penalizing near-perfect fits and rewarding utilization of existing bins can significantly improve overall packing efficiency and prevent future bottlenecks. Carefully weigh different factors.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and allow for tunable parameters. Start with a broader range of factors and iteratively refine based on performance. Prioritize heuristics that directly address the core problem constraints and objectives.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
