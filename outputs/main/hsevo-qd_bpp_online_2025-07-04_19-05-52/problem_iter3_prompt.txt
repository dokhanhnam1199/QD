Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    # A bin must have at least item size capacity\n    eligible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(eligible_bins):\n      # No bin can fit the item, prioritize creating a new bin. Since we cannot create bins in this problem.

Avoid fragmentation!\n    fill_ratio = item / bins_remain_cap\n    fill_ratio[~eligible_bins] = -np.inf # Disqualify bins that can't fit.\n    priorities = fill_ratio\n\n\n    # Add a small bonus for bins that are already relatively full. This promotes utilizing bins further before opening new ones.\n    existing_fill = 1 - (bins_remain_cap / np.max(bins_remain_cap))  # Assuming bins all have same max capacity, normalize\n    priorities[eligible_bins] += 0.1 * existing_fill[eligible_bins] #Adjustable weighting factor to existing_fill bonus.\n\n\n    # Penalty for bins that have *just enough* space; Encourages more even filling\n    # Avoiding situations where next few items can *only* go in that single bin creating bottlenecks.\n\n    small_gap = (bins_remain_cap - item) < (0.2 * np.max(bins_remain_cap)) #Bins with nearly perfect fits\n    priorities[small_gap & eligible_bins] -= 0.05 #Adjustable penalty factor\n\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to make it more effective for designing better packing heuristics, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding pitfalls.\n\nHere's a redefined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-criteria evaluation, bin utilization, future impact, adaptive weights.\n*   **Advice:** Quantify the long-term impact of placement decisions by simulating future packing stages. Dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different criteria (fit, bin utilization, fragmentation) based on real-time performance.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on solely immediate fit; neglecting the cascading effects of early decisions.\n*   **Explanation:** Heuristics often get stuck in local optima. By evaluating placement not just on immediate fit but on projected future consequences (bin fragmentation, remaining item sizes), and adaptively tweaking decision criteria weights, we can escape these traps.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
