Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

(2nd best) vs (2nd worst) show a similar pattern, with the second-best including more factors like existing fill and gap penalty, while the second worst only calculates negative log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the only differences are the comments (no code differences). (3rd) vs (4th) also show no code differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both use log ratios, but the second worst returns `-np.inf` if no bin can fit, while the worst does not handle the case where no bins are eligible to receive the item.\n\nThe best heuristics incorporate several factors and tunable weights and thresholds: fill ratio, existing fill bonus, fragmentation penalty (adaptive), near-perfect fit reward, remaining capacity consideration, and penalty for bins becoming nearly full. The worst heuristics consider only a simple ratio or log ratio, or return a zero vector if no bin is eligible. More detailed heuristics involve penalties and rewards based on capacity utilization and fragmentation. Adding tunable parameters and specific thresholds for triggering certain rewards or penalties make better heuristics, if chosen well.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls.\n\nHere's a refined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, Adaptive parameters, Multi-factor, Constraint-focused.\n*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple, constraint-focused baseline. Systematically add and tune factors like adaptive penalties and rewards based on rigorous performance evaluation.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, neglecting core constraints, and insufficient testing.\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a constraint-focused baseline and iteratively refine by combining multiple factors with tunable parameters and adaptive penalties/rewards. This method aims to balance exploration with exploitation.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
