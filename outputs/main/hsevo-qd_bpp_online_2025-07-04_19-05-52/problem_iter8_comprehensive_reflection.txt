Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls.

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, Adaptive parameters, Multi-factor, Constraint-focused.
*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple, constraint-focused baseline. Systematically add and tune factors like adaptive penalties and rewards based on rigorous performance evaluation.
*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, neglecting core constraints, and insufficient testing.
*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a constraint-focused baseline and iteratively refine by combining multiple factors with tunable parameters and adaptive penalties/rewards. This method aims to balance exploration with exploitation.
