Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

(2nd) vs (19th) is similar. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st has increased weights on utilization maximization and near-perfect fit reward and a look-ahead fragmentation penalty; Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see (3rd) has the same logic, just a smaller reward for near-perfect fit. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we observe the existing fill bonus weight and near-perfect fit reward are higher in (2nd). (14th) vs (13th), we see that (14th) adds a whole host of parameters and constraints, but doesn't actually implement the core logic, making it less effective. (17th) vs (16th) is similar. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see second worst one lacks necessary logic. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a combination of factors, use adaptive parameters, and scale and clip the final priorities. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on fill ratio tend to perform poorly. Over-parameterization without core logic is also ineffective.\n- \nOkay, I'm ready to refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to design better heuristics, keeping in mind the pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\". Let's aim for actionable advice, focusing on structured improvement and avoiding premature complexity.\n\nHere's a redefined approach to self-reflection:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Incremental, Empirical, Contextual, Validation.\n*   **Advice:** Build heuristics iteratively, validating each addition empirically. Consider the problem's context to guide feature selection.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-parameterization early on. Blindly adding features without understanding their impact.\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a clear understanding of the heuristic's behavior at each step. Start with a basic solution and only add complexity if proven necessary through careful testing and observation. Focus on data-driven decisions for feature engineering and parameter tuning.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
