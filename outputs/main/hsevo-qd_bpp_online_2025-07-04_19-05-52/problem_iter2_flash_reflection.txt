**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic prioritizes minimizing waste, utilizing existing bins, and discouraging near-perfect fits, while the worst simply uses the negative log of the fill ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst) is essentially the same. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see they are identical. (3rd) vs (4th) is identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The top heuristics focus on a multi-faceted approach, incorporating fill ratio, existing bin fullness, and a penalty for "just right" fits to prevent bottlenecks. The bottom heuristics only considers fill ratio using log scale. The consistent redundancy in the top-ranked functions suggests that the minor adjustments and multiple factors considered are the key to its superior performance, as they are repeatedly present.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics for packing problems, consider multiple factors beyond just the immediate fit. Penalizing near-perfect fits and rewarding utilization of existing bins can significantly improve overall packing efficiency and prevent future bottlenecks. Carefully weigh different factors.
