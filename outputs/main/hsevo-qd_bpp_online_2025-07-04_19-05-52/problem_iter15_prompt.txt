Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Enhanced priority function considering utilization, fragmentation, and future packing.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of remaining capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    eligible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item\n\n    if not np.any(eligible_bins):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap) - np.inf\n\n    # 1.

Design a simple, understandable baseline heuristic addressing these. Then, iteratively improve based on *measurable* performance gains obtained through *targeted* experiments addressing specific weaknesses.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, untuned parameters, vague \"relevant factors,\" and optimization without clear performance metrics. Resist the urge to add \"everything.\"\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection focuses on a structured approach. Start simple, understand *why* your heuristic fails, and introduce complexity *only* to address those specific failures. Avoid \"kitchen sink\" heuristics. Prioritize understanding and control over perceived completeness.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
