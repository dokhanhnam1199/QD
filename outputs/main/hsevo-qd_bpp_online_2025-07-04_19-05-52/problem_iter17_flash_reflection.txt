**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach considering utilization, fragmentation, and future packing, while the last one only considers the log of the fill ratio. (2nd) vs (19th) is similar. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st has increased weights on utilization maximization and near-perfect fit reward and a look-ahead fragmentation penalty; Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see (3rd) has the same logic, just a smaller reward for near-perfect fit. Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), we observe the existing fill bonus weight and near-perfect fit reward are higher in (2nd). (14th) vs (13th), we see that (14th) adds a whole host of parameters and constraints, but doesn't actually implement the core logic, making it less effective. (17th) vs (16th) is similar. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see second worst one lacks necessary logic. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate a combination of factors, use adaptive parameters, and scale and clip the final priorities. Simpler heuristics focusing solely on fill ratio tend to perform poorly. Over-parameterization without core logic is also ineffective.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with a strong core (fill ratio, existing fill), add complexity incrementally (fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit), and tune weights carefully. Avoid over-parameterization without implementing core logic. Always scale and clip the final output for stability.
