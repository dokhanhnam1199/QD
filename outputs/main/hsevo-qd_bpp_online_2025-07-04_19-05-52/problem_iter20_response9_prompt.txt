Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The last heuristic uses a simple log ratio calculation.\nComparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second heuristic uses a weighted combination of fill ratio, existing fill bonus, and fragmentation penalty. The 19th heuristic uses a simple log ratio calculation.\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first heuristic has new heuristics like 9. Bin Utilization Variance Penalty, 10. Dynamic Gap Penalty Scaling, 11. Reward for creating bins that can fit a specific \"common size\", and 12. Scale and Clip and uses more aggressive weights than the second.\nComparing (3rd) vs (4th), we see the 3rd and 4th are nearly identical; they differ only in comments.\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see 19th and 20th are nearly identical; both are the same function. Overall: Better heuristics employ multiple factors including fill ratio, fragmentation, remaining capacity, and look-ahead considerations, combining them with carefully tuned weights and adaptive penalties/rewards. They often incorporate scaling/clipping to maintain stability and prevent extreme priority values. Simpler heuristics rely on one or two factors.\n- \nOkay, I'll help you redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective self-reflection.\" Here's a refined approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem constraints, performance-driven, simplification.\n\n*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple heuristic that directly addresses core constraints. Iteratively improve by incorporating relevant factors guided by performance analysis.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, over-parameterization without justification, neglecting core problem constraints.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a functional baseline and build upon it using data-driven insights. Focus on addressing the core problem before adding complexity, and only add complexity where there is a demonstrated performance improvement.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
