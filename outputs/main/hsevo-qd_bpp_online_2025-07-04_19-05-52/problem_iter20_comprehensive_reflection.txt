Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection." Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem constraints, performance-driven, simplification.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a simple heuristic that directly addresses core constraints. Iteratively improve by incorporating relevant factors guided by performance analysis.

*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, over-parameterization without justification, neglecting core problem constraints.

*   **Explanation:** Prioritize a functional baseline and build upon it using data-driven insights. Focus on addressing the core problem before adding complexity, and only add complexity where there is a demonstrated performance improvement.
