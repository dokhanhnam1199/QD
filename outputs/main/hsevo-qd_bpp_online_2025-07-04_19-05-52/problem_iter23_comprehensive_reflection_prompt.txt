{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize core objectives (fill ratio, fragmentation). Dynamically adjust parameters based on problem characteristics (item size, bin capacity). Add new features incrementally, evaluating their impact. Avoid over-parameterization; simpler heuristics can be more robust. Feature ablation (removal) is as valuable as addition.\n```\nWhen designing heuristics for packing problems, consider multiple factors beyond just the immediate fit. Penalizing near-perfect fits and rewarding utilization of existing bins can significantly improve overall packing efficiency and prevent future bottlenecks. Carefully weigh different factors.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors and allow for tunable parameters. Start with a broader range of factors and iteratively refine based on performance. Prioritize heuristics that directly address the core problem constraints and objectives.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors beyond the most obvious. Implement adaptive parameters based on problem context. Fine-tune the weights and thresholds to balance different objectives (e.g., fill ratio vs. fragmentation).\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors, weight them appropriately, dynamically adjust penalties/rewards, and ensure numerical stability. Start simple, then iteratively add complexity by incorporating additional relevant factors and fine-tuning weights using experimentation.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nComplex heuristics require thoughtful feature engineering and tuning. Start with a simple baseline, then iteratively add and refine factors like fragmentation penalties and near-perfect fit bonuses. Adaptive penalties and tunable weights/thresholds significantly improve heuristic performance, but require careful optimization and testing.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a strong core (fill ratio, existing fill), add complexity incrementally (fragmentation penalty, near-perfect fit), and tune weights carefully. Avoid over-parameterization without implementing core logic. Always scale and clip the final output for stability.\n```\n\nIn designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, assign appropriate weights, and include adaptive penalties/rewards to handle diverse scenarios. Incorporate scaling/clipping mechanisms to ensure stability and prevent dominance by individual factors. Look-ahead consideration by consolidate smaller items.\"\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
