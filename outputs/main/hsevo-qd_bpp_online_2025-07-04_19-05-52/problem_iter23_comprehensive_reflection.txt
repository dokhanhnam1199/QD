Okay, let's redefine self-reflection for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Objective functions, problem structure, iterative refinement, ablation studies, generalization, adaptability, computational cost, exploration-exploitation balance.

*   **Advice:** Focus on understanding *why* a heuristic works (or doesn't). Analyze performance across diverse problem instances to identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. Prioritize adaptability and computational efficiency in design.

*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, reliance on isolated performance metrics, lack of problem structure analysis, and neglecting computational cost.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection involves deeply understanding the problem, the heuristic's limitations, and how design choices influence generalization and computational efficiency. Iteratively refine based on rigorous analysis and ablation, always questioning the value of added complexity.
