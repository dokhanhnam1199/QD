**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers utilization, fragmentation, near-perfect fits, remaining capacity, and penalizes nearly full bins, while the worst only uses log ratios of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) show a similar pattern, with the second-best including more factors like existing fill and gap penalty, while the second worst only calculates negative log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the only differences are the comments (no code differences). (3rd) vs (4th) also show no code differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both use log ratios, but the second worst returns `-np.inf` if no bin can fit, while the worst does not handle the case where no bins are eligible to receive the item.

The best heuristics incorporate several factors and tunable weights and thresholds: fill ratio, existing fill bonus, fragmentation penalty (adaptive), near-perfect fit reward, remaining capacity consideration, and penalty for bins becoming nearly full. The worst heuristics consider only a simple ratio or log ratio, or return a zero vector if no bin is eligible. More detailed heuristics involve penalties and rewards based on capacity utilization and fragmentation. Adding tunable parameters and specific thresholds for triggering certain rewards or penalties make better heuristics, if chosen well.

**Experience:**

Complex heuristics require thoughtful feature engineering and tuning. Start with a simple baseline, then iteratively add and refine factors like fragmentation penalties and near-perfect fit bonuses. Adaptive penalties and tunable weights/thresholds significantly improve heuristic performance, but require careful optimization and testing.
