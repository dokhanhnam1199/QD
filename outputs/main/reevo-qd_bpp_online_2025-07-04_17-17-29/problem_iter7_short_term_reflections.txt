Prioritize tight fits, avoid extreme fragmentation, and consider penalties for bins becoming nearly full.

The better code uses remaining space and a near-fullness bonus, addressing fragmentation and fit issues absent in the ratio-based approach.

The better code prioritizes tight fits, penalizes overfilling/leaving too much space, and handles non-fitting items explicitly.

Consider remaining space, fragmentation avoidance, and infeasibility handling for robust bin selection.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid excessive fragmentation, and penalize infeasible assignments.

The better code prioritizes fitting, nearly full bins, and penalizes wasted space using thresholds and tuned weights.

The better code uses remaining space, avoids fragmentation, and penalizes near-full bins for diversity.

The better code prioritizes fitting, near fullness, avoids overfilling, and penalizes large remaining space.

The better code employs first-fit decreasing, avoids fragmentation, and uses dynamic tolerance thresholds and penalties.

Prioritize fitting, encourage near-full bins, penalize overfilling and large remaining space for better packing.
