The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes waste, and balances bin fullness via targeted bonuses/penalties.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid excessive fragmentation, and dynamically adjust penalties/rewards based on item size.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize small remaining space, and add dynamic boosts based on item size.

Consider remaining space, fragmentation avoidance, and dynamically adjust priorities based on item size.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize excessive emptiness/fullness, and dynamically adjust boosts based on item size.

The better code uses remaining space and avoids overfilling, aligning with First-Fit Decreasing and fragmentation avoidance.

Prioritize tight fits, reward near-full bins, penalize overfills, and handle infeasibility explicitly for better BPP heuristics.

Consider fitting, fullness, and leaving space for future items when designing bin-packing heuristics.

The improved code prioritizes fitting, near-full bins, and penalizes excessive emptiness, unlike the ratio-based approach.

The better code uses remaining space directly and adds a boost for near-full bins, preventing fragmentation and overallocation.
