Prioritize tight fits, avoid excessive fragmentation, and penalize bins becoming almost full, handling infeasibility.

Prioritize tight fits, fullness after packing, and penalize bins becoming too full. Consider item size relationships.

Prioritize fitting items. Reward near-full and half-full bins. Penalize overflows based on magnitude.

The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes wasted space, and avoids bins becoming too full.

The better code incorporates first-fit decreasing, fragmentation avoidance, and handles infeasibility, improving bin utilization.

The better code uses remaining space and bin fullness to guide item placement, prioritizing near-full bins and penalizing excessive fullness.

The better code prioritizes fitting, fullness, and avoiding overfilling, using explicit rules and thresholds.

The better code prioritizes fitting, near-full bins, and penalizes overfilling and excessive space, improving packing efficiency.

Prioritize tight fits, penalize near-overflow and excessive emptiness, and dynamically adjust parameters based on item size.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid excessive fragmentation, and penalize near-full bins to promote diversity.
