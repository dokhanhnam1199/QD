Prioritize tight fits, avoid fragmentation, and penalize infeasibility. Also, consider exploration by tuning the boost value.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid fragmentation, and penalize infeasible placements. Add small boosts for near-full bins.

The better code uses remaining space and a "nearly full" bonus, addressing fragmentation and bin utilization more directly.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, and avoid excessive fullness for improved bin packing.

The better code incorporates first-fit decreasing and fragmentation avoidance, which the first one lacks.

The better code uses remaining space, fragmentation avoidance, and infeasibility handling for improved bin packing.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid excessive fragmentation, and penalize bins where the item doesn't fit.

Prioritize tight fits; discourage fragmentation; penalize infeasibility; tune boost magnitude, tolerate a bin size.

The better code prioritizes tight fits and avoids fragmentation, crucial for bin packing efficiency.

Prioritize tighter fits, avoid fragmentation, and penalize infeasible placements. A small boost to near-full bins helps.
