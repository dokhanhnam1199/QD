The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes wasted space, and avoids bins becoming too full, improving packing efficiency.

The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes wasted space, and avoids bins becoming too full.

The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes wasted space/fragmentation, and avoids bins becoming too full.

The better code incorporates First-Fit Decreasing, fragmentation avoidance, and handles infeasibility, improving bin utilization.

Prioritize tight fits, reward near-full bins, penalize overfilled bins, and handle infeasibility explicitly.

The better code uses remaining space & "nearly full" boosts to reduce fragmentation, a key BPP strategy.

The better code prioritizes tight fits, avoids fragmentation, and handles infeasibility, which the first version lacks.

The better code uses remaining space and fullness ratio, avoiding fragmentation and overflow, crucial for online bin packing.

Prioritize tight fits and avoid near-full bins. Penalize infeasible placements harshly.

The better code prioritizes tight fits, avoids fragmentation, and handles infeasibility, which the worse code lacks.
