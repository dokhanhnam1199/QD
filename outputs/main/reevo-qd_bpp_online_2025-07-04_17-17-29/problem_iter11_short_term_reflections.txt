Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, avoid excessive fullness, and penalize infeasibility.

Prioritize fitting items, reward near-full and medium-full bins, and penalize overflow.

Prioritize fitting, nearly-full bins. Discourage overfilling. Dynamically adjust priorities based on remaining space.

The better code uses remaining space and thresholds for near/almost full bins to minimize fragmentation.

The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes wasted space, and avoids excessive fragmentation, unlike the ratio-based approach.

Consider bin "fullness," fragmentation avoidance, infeasibility handling, and tuning boost factors.

The improved code uses remaining space, fragmentation avoidance, and dynamic adjustments based on item size.

Prioritize fitting, minimize wasted space, and avoid overfilling to improve bin packing performance.

The better code prioritizes fitting, minimizes waste, and balances fullness with overflow risk using thresholds and ratios.

Prioritize tight fits, avoid fragmentation, and penalize infeasible assignments for better bin packing.
