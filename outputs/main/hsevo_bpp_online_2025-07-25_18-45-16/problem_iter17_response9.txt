```python
import numpy as np

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """Prioritizes bins by availability and normalized waste minimization for optimal bin selection."""
    can_fit = (bins_remain_cap >= item).astype(float)
    normalized_waste = np.where(bins_remain_cap > 0, (bins_remain_cap - item) / bins_remain_cap, 0)
    priority_scores = can_fit * (1 - normalized_waste)
    return priority_scores
```

This function combines the availability check and normalized waste minimization to ensure items fit and leftover space is minimized.
