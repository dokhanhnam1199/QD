**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st) incorporates additional parameters for fine-tuning and explicitly considers normalized waste minimization with a balanced weight, while the worst (20th) repeatedly calculates and normalizes waste without clearly differentiating between bins that cannot fit the item and those that can, leading to less precise prioritization.
(Second best) vs (second worst), we see that the second best heuristic (2nd) also uses normalized waste minimization and checks item fit, but lacks the fine-tuning parameters of the best heuristic. The second worst (19th) is nearly identical to the worst, showing redundancy without added value.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic nuances item placement with weighted considerations, whereas the second-best uses a straightforward waste minimization approach without adjustments.
(3rd) vs (4th), we see the third heuristic accounting for negative waste by setting it to infinity and normalizing, while the fourth improves on this by scaling normalized waste with max and min waste values for better differentiation.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see no difference, suggesting redundant efforts in both heuristics.
Overall:

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, prioritize normalized waste minimization while incorporating explicit fit checks and parameter fine-tuning for balanced prioritization. Avoid redundancy and ensure robust handling of edge cases like negative waste.
