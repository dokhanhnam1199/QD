"**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) Heuristics 1st vs (worst) Heuristics 20th, we see that the best avoids division by zero and properly combines waste minimization and fit availability with normalization. The worst does not account for zero division safeguard and improperly combines waste with balance, leading to inconsistent priority scores. Comparing (second best) Heuristics 2nd vs (second worst) Heuristics 19th, both minimize waste and consider fit availability but the second best consistently normalizes waste by capacity, enhancing prioritization. Overall:

**Experience:**
Prioritize normalization, safeguard against division by zero, and clearly define the relationship between waste and fit for robust prioritization in heuristics design."
