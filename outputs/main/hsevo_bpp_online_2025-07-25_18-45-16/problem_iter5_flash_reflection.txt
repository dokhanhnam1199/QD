"**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) Heuristics 1st vs (worst) Heuristics 20th, we see that the best heuristics focuses on minimizing waste directly by prioritizing bins that result in the least waste after adding an item, which fills bins more efficiently. The worst heuristic combines proximity to item size and remaining capacity, which does not directly address minimizing waste. (Second best) Heuristics 2nd combines waste reduction and availability balance, providing a balanced approach compared to the sole waste minimization of the first. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that the first is more straightforward and directly efficient in waste reduction, while the second incorporates a more nuanced balance. (3rd) vs (4th) are exactly the same as the first, indicating redundancy. (Second worst) Heuristics 19th vs (worst) Heuristics 20th both prioritize reducing waste but in different ways; the second worst normalizes priority based on bin initial fullness, adding complexity without a significant improvement in efficacy. Overall: The best heuristics minimize waste directly, while the worst prioritizes secondary factors like relative capacity or closeness to item size, which do not directly lead to maximizing efficiency or minimizing waste.

**Experience:** Prioritize direct waste minimization and avoid adding unnecessary complexity without clear benefits to efficiency or effectiveness in bin packing heuristics."
