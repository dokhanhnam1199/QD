- **Keywords:** Waste minimization, efficiency, clarity, focus
- **Advice:** Focus on straightforward heuristics that directly address underutilized bin space without introducing redundancy or complexity.
- **Avoid:** Balancing wasted space with initial bin availability, overly complex capacity optimizations that do not带来 measurable performance gains.
- **Explanation:** By concentrating on simple yet effective heuristics, we can enhance bin packing efficiency without the overhead of unnecessary complexity. This approach ensures that our focus remains on the primary goal of minimizing waste while maintaining or improving operational performance.
