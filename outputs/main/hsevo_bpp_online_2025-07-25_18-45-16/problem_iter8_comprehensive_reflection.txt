- **Advice**: Design heuristics with a direct focus on minimizing waste through straightforward logic and normalized assessments. Ensure that each component of the heuristic directly contributes to achieving the minimal waste objective.

- **Avoid**: Complex algorithms, unnecessary imports, indirect waste reduction methods, and approaches that do not clearly improve performance.

- **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity and direct waste minimization, the heuristic becomes more effective and easier to fine-tune. Normalization ensures consistent scoring, while avoiding unnecessary complexity prevents overcomplication and potential inefficiencies. Direct targeting ensures that all actions contribute directly to the primary goal, improving both speed and effectiveness.
