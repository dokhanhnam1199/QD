**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best code effectively handles edge cases, normalizes waste in a balanced way, and includes fit availability as a key factor. The worst heuristic repeats the same flawed logic multiple times, using inverse waste without normalization correctly and assigning infinite priority values to certain cases. (Second best) vs (second worst) highlights the importance of correctly handling non-fitting items and normalizing waste to ensure reasonable priority values. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the first function normalizes waste by considering the maximum capacity effectively, whereas the second sometimes assigns zero waste to items that cannot fit, which is inconsistent. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that the third function applies a weighted balance between fit availability and waste normalization more intuitively. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both have the same issues of incorrect normalization and infinite priority assignments for non-fitting items. Overall: The best heuristics prioritize normalization correctness and balanced weighting between fit availability and waste minimization, while the worst neglect these factors and repeat inefficient code.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, always prioritize edge case handling, effective normalization techniques, and balanced weighting of key factors. Avoid redundancy and costly recompute in the same function.
