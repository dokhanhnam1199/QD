- **Advice:**
  - Prioritize normalized waste minimization with clear logic for decision-making.
  - Explicitly check fit availability and balance it with waste criteria.
  - Fine-tune parameters for effective heuristic performance.
  - Implement robust checks to handle edge cases, including negative waste scenarios.

- **Avoid:**
  - Complex inverted capacity approaches and unnecessary adjustments (e.g., sinusoidal).
  - Repetitive or redundant logic.
  - Division by zero in normalization techniques.
  - Adding complexity without clear benefits to efficiency or effectiveness.

- **Explanation:** This approach ensures that the heuristics are straightforward, efficient, and focused on the primary goal of minimizing waste while effectively utilizing bin capacity. By normalizing waste and explicitly checking fit availability, the heuristics can make informed decisions, leading to better overall performance in bin packing problems without unnecessary complications.
