Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This design implements a heuristic based on the remaining capacity of the bins.\n    Is a priority score based on filling tighter bins first, aiming to close the \n    bins as much as possible to trigger first fit for new bins sooner.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Inverse of remaining capacity (sinusoidal function to prioritize the almost full bins)\n    return 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-6) * np.sin(np.pi / 2 * (bins_remain_cap / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 1e-6)))\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords**: Simplicity, Clear Logic, Waste Reduction, Direct Targeting, Normalization, Resource Availability\n\n- **Advice**: Design heuristics with a direct focus on minimizing waste through straightforward logic and normalized assessments. Ensure that each component of the heuristic directly contributes to achieving the minimal waste objective.\n\n- **Avoid**: Complex algorithms, unnecessary imports, indirect waste reduction methods, and approaches that do not clearly improve performance.\n\n- **Explanation**: By focusing on simplicity and direct waste minimization, the heuristic becomes more effective and easier to fine-tune. Normalization ensures consistent scoring, while avoiding unnecessary complexity prevents overcomplication and potential inefficiencies. Direct targeting ensures that all actions contribute directly to the primary goal, improving both speed and effectiveness.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
