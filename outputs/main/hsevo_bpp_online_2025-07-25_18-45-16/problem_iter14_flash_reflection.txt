**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (1st) effectively balances fit availability and normalized waste, leading to well-distributed items across bins. The worst heuristic (19th) incorrectly calculates priority based on positive normalized waste, deterring optimal bin selection.

(Second best) vs (second worst) showcases a stark difference in normalization and waste handling. The second best (2nd) minimizes waste using normalized scores while ignoring unavailable bins, whereas the second worst (18th) assigns priority based on positive normalized waste, similar to the worst.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see a nuanced difference: the best heuristic considers the availability and normalized waste, while the second best focuses solely on waste minimization after normalizing.

(3rd) vs (4th) highlights that the third heuristic uses a sinusoidal function to prioritize almost full bins, while the fourth focuses on normalized waste, leading to different strategies for filling bins efficiently.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see repetitive logic, suggesting a lack of diversity in heuristic approaches in the bottom rankings.

Overall:

**Experience:**
Balancing fit availability with normalized waste, using robust normalization techniques, and avoiding repetitive logicLead to superior heuristic designs for bin packing.
