- **Keywords**: Normalization, Waste Minimization, Fit Availability, Robust Logic
- **Advice**: 
  - Focus on designing heuristics that directly minimize waste and maximize fit availability.
  - Use normalization to create a clear and consistent scoring system for fit and waste.
  - Simplify logic to ensure heuristics are robust and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Avoid**: 
  - Complex sinusoidal adjustments and inverted capacity approaches.
  - Unnecessary logic or processes that do not contribute to efficiency or effectiveness.
- **Explanation**: 
  - Simplifying heuristics and focusing on clear, direct strategies ensures they are more effective and easier to implement. Normalization provides a consistent framework, preventing issues like division by zero and ensuring robust prioritization. By avoiding complex adjustments and unnecessary additions, you maintain a focus on the primary objectives, leading to better optimization outcomes.
