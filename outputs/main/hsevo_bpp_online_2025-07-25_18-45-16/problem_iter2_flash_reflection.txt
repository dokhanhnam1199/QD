**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics focus on balancing the reduction in waste with the initial fullness of bins, ensuring items fit without penalizing overly low capacity bins. The worst heuristics prioritize overly full bins using algorithms that can lead to high wastage or infeasibility. Comparing (second best) vs (second worst), we observe that the second best uses a combination of proximity to item size and space reduction, while the second worst inverts capacity for an unnecessary sinusoidal function that does not effectively manage space or reduce waste. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the same underlying principle with minor variations in formula implementation but both aim to minimize waste effectively. (3rd) vs (4th) show that while both prioritize nearly full bins, the sinusoidal function in (3rd) adds unnecessary complexity without enhancing performance. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both prioritize filling nearly full bins but the worst approach does so in a more convoluted manner without efficiency gains. Overall: The best heuristics efficiently manage waste and balance initial space availability without unnecessary complexity.

**Experience:**
Balance waste reduction with initial bin availability; avoid complex inverted capacity approaches that do not enhance performance.
