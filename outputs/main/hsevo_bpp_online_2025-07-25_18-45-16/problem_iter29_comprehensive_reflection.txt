- **Advice:**  
  - Prioritize direct waste minimization using normalized metrics.
  - Ensure robust edge case handling and flexible dynamic weighting.
  - Incorporate explicit fit checks and parameter fine-tuning.
  - Design for clarity and simplicity, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Avoid:**  
  - Complex inverted capacity approaches.
  - Sinusoidal adjustments and repetitive logic.
  - Over-reliance on initial bin availability without considering capacity needs.
- **Explanation:**  
  By focusing on normalization and direct waste minimization, heuristics become more effective and efficient. Incorporating fit checks and parameter fine-tuning enhances decision-making, while robust edge case handling ensures reliability. Avoiding unnecessary complexity makes heuristics easier to understand and maintain, directly contributing to better performance in optimization problems.
