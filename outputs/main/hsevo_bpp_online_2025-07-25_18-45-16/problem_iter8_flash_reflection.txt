**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics directly prioritizes bins with least remaining capacity after adding the item while considering fit availability, minimizing waste efficiently. The worst heuristic uses a sinusoidal function and normalization which makes it less straightforward to interpret and less effective. 
(second best) vs (second worst) — The second-best heuristic focuses on minimizing waste with normalized scores, ensuring that bins with least waste get prioritized properly, unlike the second-worst which uses random imports and thresholds inefficiently.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see minimal differences in logic, both aiming to minimize waste, but the first uses cleaner logic with a clear approach.
(3rd) vs (4th) — Both similar, but minor optimizations in the 3rd make it slightly better in readability and effectiveness.
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see a shift from somewhat rational logic combining waste minimization and normalization to an overly complicated heuristic with unnecessary imports and mathematical transforms.
Overall: Best heuristics minimize waste, are straightforward, and prioritize fit availability efficiently; worst heuristics are overly complex or incorrect, leading to inefficient performance.

**Experience:**
Focus on simplicity and clear logic when designing heuristics for optimization problems. Directly target the objective (minimizing waste) with normalized scoring and fit availability checks. Avoid unnecessary complexity or imports that do not add value.
