- **Keywords:** Normalization, Waste Minimization, Fit Availability, Robustness
- **Advice:** Focus on normalized waste minimization, explicitly check fit availability, parameter tuning, and robust handling of edge cases.
- **Avoid:** Unnecessary complexity, sinusoidal adjustments, redundant logic.
- **Explanation:** Design heuristics with simplicity and clear logic at their core. Normalize waste to ensure balanced prioritization without overcomplicating the process. Directly assess fit availability and focus on edge cases to enhance robustness. Avoid unnecessary refinements and adjustments that do not significantly improve efficiency or effectiveness.
