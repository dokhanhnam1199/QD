{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEmphasize fit availability and balanced criteria weighting for better heuristic design. Avoid repetitive approaches; focus on unique criteria combinations that enhance decision-making.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nBalance waste reduction with initial bin availability; avoid complex inverted capacity approaches that do not enhance performance.\n\nPrioritize direct waste minimization and avoid adding unnecessary complexity without clear benefits to efficiency or effectiveness in bin packing heuristics.\"\n\nFocus on simplicity and clear logic when designing heuristics for optimization problems. Directly target the objective (minimizing waste) with normalized scoring and fit availability checks. Avoid unnecessary complexity or imports that do not add value.\n\nPrioritize normalization, safeguard against division by zero, and clearly define the relationship between waste and fit for robust prioritization in heuristics design.\"\n\nBalancing fit availability with normalized waste, using robust normalization techniques, and avoiding repetitive logicLead to superior heuristic designs for bin packing.\n\nEnsure heuristics prioritize fit availability and normalize waste for effective use; sinusoidal adjustments should be avoided as they complicate and detract from primary objectives.\n\nTo design better heuristics, prioritize normalized waste minimization while incorporating explicit fit checks and parameter fine-tuning for balanced prioritization. Avoid redundancy and ensure robust handling of edge cases like negative waste.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
