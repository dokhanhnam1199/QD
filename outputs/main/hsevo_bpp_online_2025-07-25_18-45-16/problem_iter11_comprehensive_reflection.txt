- **Keywords:** Normalization, Waste Minimization, Clear Definitions, Robust Prioritization, Simplicity

- **Advice:**
  - Emphasize robust normalization techniques to ensure consistency.
  - Design criteria for clear definitions of waste and fit to enhance heuristic decision-making.
  - Focus on simplicity in algorithm logic to maintain clarity and efficiency.

- **Avoid:**
  - Complex inverted capacity approaches or any method that introduces unnecessary complexity.
  - Indirect targeting of the primary objective (minimizing waste).

- **Explanation:** By focusing on these elements, the heuristic design can achieve a balance between functionality and simplicity. Normalization ensures that all inputs are on the same scale, preventing bias. Clear definitions of what constitutes waste and fit allow the heuristic to make informed decisions. Simplicity ensures that the heuristic is easy to understand, implement, and maintain, reducing the risk of errors and enhancing performance. Avoiding unnecessary complexity maintains the focus on directly minimizing waste, ensuring that the heuristic remains effective and efficient.
