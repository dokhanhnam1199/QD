**Analysis:**
Comparing **Heuristics 1st** vs **Heuristics 20th**: The 1st heuristic efficiently combines fit availability and normalized waste minimization, prioritizing bins that can hold the item with minimal leftover space. The 20th heuristic Normalizes remaining capacities and calculates waste in a similar manner but lacks the emphasis on ensuring fit availability and uses a more complicated approach that does not effectively penalize infeasible bins.
Comparing **Heuristics 2nd** vs **Heuristics 19th**: The 2nd heuristic calculates priority by balancing normalized waste and remaining capacity, with clear handling of infeasible bins. The 19th heuristic performs similarly to the 20th but does not balance different criteria as effectively as the 2nd.
Comparing **Heuristics 3rd** vs **Heuristics 18th**: The 3rd heuristic includes fit availability and minimizes normalized waste with tunable parameters, enhancing adaptability. The 18th heuristic is identical to the 20th in its implementation.
Comparing **Heuristics 4th** vs **Heuristics 17th**: The 4th heuristic normalizes remaining capacities and waste, counts fit availability, and ensures no division by zero. The 17th heuristic is a repeat of the 20th, lacking the more nuanced prioritization of the 4th.
Comparing **Heuristics 5th** vs **Heuristics 16th**: The 5th heuristic minimizes normalized waste while ensuring only fit bins are considered. The 16th heuristic is identical to the 20th, which does not adequately penalize infeasible bins.
Comparing **Heuristics 6th** vs **Heuristics 15th**: Both heuristics aim to fill tighter bins first similar to a sinusoidal first-fit heuristic. The sinusoidal function in Heuristic 6th adds variability and is not as direct as the straightforward penalization in Heuristic 15th.
Comparing **Heuristics 7th** vs **Heuristics 14th**: Heuristic 7th enhances prioritization by minimizing normalized waste and considering fit availability effectively. Heuristic 14th, like others, repeats the same normalized waste calculation approach, lacking additional context checks.
Comparing **Heuristics 8th** vs **Heuristics 13th**: These are identical to Heuristic 6th and the repeated Heuristic 20th respectively, with 8th showing slightly different goals compared to the repetitive normalized calculations in 13th.
Overall: Top heuristics emphasize fit availability and use normalized waste effectively to prioritize bins. Lower-ranked heuristics often repeat similar normalized waste calculations without adequately considering bin fit availability, leading to less effective prioritization.

**Experience:**
Emphasize fit availability and balanced criteria weighting for better heuristic design. Avoid repetitive approaches; focus on unique criteria combinations that enhance decision-making.
