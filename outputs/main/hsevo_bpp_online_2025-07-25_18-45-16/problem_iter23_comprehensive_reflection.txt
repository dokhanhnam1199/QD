- **Keywords**: Normalization, Fit Availability, Criteria Weighting, Direct Waste Minimization
- **Advice**: Integrate normalized waste measurement and direct fit checks. Use weighted criteria that balance availability and minimization objectives.
- **Avoid**: Repetitive approaches, complex inversion logic, sinusoidal adjustments, unnecessary complexity
- **Explanation**: By focusing on normalization and clear fit checks, you ensure that the heuristic directly targets the problem's objectives without adding unnecessary complexity. Balanced criteria weighting and minimizing waste directly enhance decision-making and heuristic performance.
