**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristic (Heuristic 1st) provides a balance between fit availability and weighted normalized waste minimization, efficiently utilizing weights to compute priorities. The worst heuristic (Heuristic 20th) recursively uses the same logic with repeated weighting criteria, lacking variation and failing to show improvements over simpler heuristics. (Second best) vs (second worst) shows a shift from dynamic balancing with contextual considerations to static prioritization based on remaining capacity inversely, lacking adaptability. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best handles normalized waste and fit availability more smoothly, whereas the second prioritizes bins by filling the tightest bins first, introducing instability. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals that the third approach combines direct fit checks and waste minimization with balanced weighting, while the fourth focuses solely on closing bins prematurely, missing opportunities for better layout. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see repeated mechanisms without learning or adaptability, making both less dynamic in handling various bin sizes and item distributions. Overall:

**Experience:**
Effective heuristics balance fit availability with waste minimization through dynamic weighting and normalization, adapting to varying bin-capacity contexts to optimize placement efficiently.
