**Analysis:**
Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see that the best heuristics effectively manage to normalize waste, consider item fit availability, and aim to minimize leftover space, providing a clear priority for bin selection. In contrast, the worst heuristics prioritize bins sineoidally based on remaining capacity without considering item fit, leading to less effective waste minimization. (second best) vs (second worst) shows a similar trend, with the second-best emphasizing balanced minimization of waste and remaining capacity, while the second-worst focuses solely on fit availability without proper normalization. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see minimal differences in methodology, with the second option using a sinusoidal adjustment for waste, which is not necessary. (3rd) vs (4th) illustrates a shift from direct waste normalization to sinusoidal waste consideration, decreasing effectiveness. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the worst considering sinusoidal fit without fit availability checks, rendering it ineffective. Overall: Best heuristics prioritize fit availability and normalized waste minimization effectively, whereas worst heuristics focus incorrectly on sinusoidal adjustments without considering critical item fit criteria.

**Experience:**
Ensure heuristics prioritize fit availability and normalize waste for effective use; sinusoidal adjustments should be avoided as they complicate and detract from primary objectives.
