Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This design implements a heuristic based on the remaining capacity of the bins.\n    Is a priority score based on filling tighter bins first, aiming to close the \n    bins as much as possible to trigger first fit for new bins sooner.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Inverse of remaining capacity (sinusoidal function to prioritize the almost full bins)\n    return 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap + 1e-6) * np.sin(np.pi / 2 * (bins_remain_cap / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + 1e-6)))\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \n- **Keywords:** Normalization, Fit Availability, Direct Waste Minimization, Robust Edge Handling, Parameter Tuning\n\n- **Advice:**\n  - Prioritize normalized waste minimization with clear logic for decision-making.\n  - Explicitly check fit availability and balance it with waste criteria.\n  - Fine-tune parameters for effective heuristic performance.\n  - Implement robust checks to handle edge cases, including negative waste scenarios.\n\n- **Avoid:**\n  - Complex inverted capacity approaches and unnecessary adjustments (e.g., sinusoidal).\n  - Repetitive or redundant logic.\n  - Division by zero in normalization techniques.\n  - Adding complexity without clear benefits to efficiency or effectiveness.\n\n- **Explanation:** This approach ensures that the heuristics are straightforward, efficient, and focused on the primary goal of minimizing waste while effectively utilizing bin capacity. By normalizing waste and explicitly checking fit availability, the heuristics can make informed decisions, leading to better overall performance in bin packing problems without unnecessary complications.\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
