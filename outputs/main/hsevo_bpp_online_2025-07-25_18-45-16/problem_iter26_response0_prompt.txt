Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

The worst heuristic (Heuristic 20th) recursively uses the same logic with repeated weighting criteria, lacking variation and failing to show improvements over simpler heuristics. (Second best) vs (second worst) shows a shift from dynamic balancing with contextual considerations to static prioritization based on remaining capacity inversely, lacking adaptability. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best handles normalized waste and fit availability more smoothly, whereas the second prioritizes bins by filling the tightest bins first, introducing instability. (3rd) vs (4th) reveals that the third approach combines direct fit checks and waste minimization with balanced weighting, while the fourth focuses solely on closing bins prematurely, missing opportunities for better layout. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see repeated mechanisms without learning or adaptability, making both less dynamic in handling various bin sizes and item distributions. Overall:\n- \n- **Keywords:** Normalization, Fit Availability, Direct Waste Minimization, Robust Edge Handling, Parameter Tuning\n\n- **Advice:**\n  - Prioritize normalized waste minimization with clear logic for decision-making.\n  - Explicitly check fit availability and balance it with waste criteria.\n  - Fine-tune parameters for effective heuristic performance.\n  - Implement robust checks to handle edge cases, including negative waste scenarios.\n\n- **Avoid:**\n  - Complex inverted capacity approaches and unnecessary adjustments (e.g., sinusoidal).\n  - Repetitive or redundant logic.\n  - Division by zero in normalization techniques.\n  - Adding complexity without clear benefits to efficiency or effectiveness.\n\n- **Explanation:** This approach ensures that the heuristics are straightforward, efficient, and focused on the primary goal of minimizing waste while effectively utilizing bin capacity. By normalizing waste and explicitly checking fit availability, the heuristics can make informed decisions, leading to better overall performance in bin packing problems without unnecessary complications.\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
