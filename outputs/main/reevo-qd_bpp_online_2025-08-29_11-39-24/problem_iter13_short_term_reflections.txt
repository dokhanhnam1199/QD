Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoid extremes for better packing.
Prioritize proximity & feasibility; avoid zero-division; simple is often better initially.




Prioritize exact fits, smooth waste calculations, and consider bin fullness for nuanced packing.




Prioritize exact fits, waste minimization, and bin fullness balance—small bonuses help too!
Emphasize bin fullness & avoid large remaining capacities; tune sigmoid for sensitivity.




Prioritize tighter fits & penalize non-fits heavily; avoid unnecessary computations & use `np.where` efficiently.
Prioritize nuanced fit & bin fullness; avoid extremes; use smooth, normalized scoring functions.
Prioritize exact fits, consider bin fullness, and use smooth, scaled scoring functions for nuanced prioritization.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoid extremes! Nuance scoring helps.




Prioritize simplicity & proximity; avoid unnecessary complexity like sigmoid functions & heavy weighting. Focus on direct fit.
