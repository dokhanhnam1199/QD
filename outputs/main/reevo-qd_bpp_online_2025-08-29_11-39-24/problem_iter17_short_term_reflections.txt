Prioritize fit, smooth with sigmoids, normalize scores, and avoid numerical instability—consider item-specific parameters.




Prioritize non-linear combinations of fullness & remaining capacity; tune scaling for exploration/exploitation balance.




Prioritize exact fits & minimize waste; consider remaining capacity for better bin utilization.
Prioritize fit, explore occasionally, and avoid zero-valued scores—softmax or random additions help!
Prioritize tighter fits; penalize wasted space. Simplicity & directness often outperform complex, hand-tuned logic.




Prioritize simplicity & exploit item-bin fit; avoid over-engineering complex fullness calculations. Exact fit first is key.




Prioritize fit, add exploration, and normalize scores—balance exploitation & prevent premature convergence.
Prioritize simpler, direct scores; normalize carefully; Gaussian bonuses beat sigmoid for smoothness & tuning.




Prioritize exact fits & balance waste minimization with moderate bin fullness—simplicity often wins.




Favor exact fits, minimize remaining space, and balance fullness with waste reduction—add a small constant to avoid division by zero.
