Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste, and consider bin fullness for nuanced packing.
Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) & normalize scores; avoid extremes & division issues. Tune parameters!
Prioritize simplicity, normalize values, and use smooth functions (like sigmoid) for nuanced scoring.
Combine exact fit, waste minimization, and bin fullness; moderate fullness is key.
Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) & reward near-full bins; normalize scores for balanced choices.
Prioritize exact fits & minimize waste; consider remaining capacity for better bin utilization.
Prioritize best-fit, limit exploration, and consider bin fullness—not just random choices.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—balance exploration & exploitation.
Prioritize fit *and* bin state; avoid extremes—snug fits & nearly full/empty bins help.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—balance exploration & exploitation.
