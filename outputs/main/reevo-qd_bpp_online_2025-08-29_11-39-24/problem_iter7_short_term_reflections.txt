Combine fit *and* fullness; sigmoid scaling prevents dominance & adds nuance. Tune parameters!
Prioritize bins closer to item size; avoid worst-fit’s maximal remaining capacity focus. Consider item density.
Prioritize fit *and* explore thoughtfully; normalization & sigmoid shaping can significantly improve bin packing performance.




Prioritize exact fits, nuanced waste minimization, and bin fullness awareness for improved online BPP heuristics.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Small adjustments to priority scores significantly impact performance.




Simplicity & minimizing waste often win. Focus on remaining capacity, avoid complex scoring initially.




Prioritize valid bins, balance exploitation (greedy fit) with exploration (randomness) – adjust exploration rate.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize wasted space—avoiding division by zero—for better bin utilization.
Prioritize fit *and* avoid zero values; consider item-bin *distance*, not just capacity.




Prioritize exact fits, then balance waste & bin fullness; avoid extreme preferences.
