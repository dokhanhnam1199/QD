Prioritize tightest fits & exact matches; avoid leaving large gaps—balance utilization & bin count.




Prioritize fit *and* fragmentation; consider remaining capacity—not just immediate gain. Exploration helps, but be mindful!




Prioritize minimizing *waste* (remaining space); simpler, direct scoring often outperforms complex combinations. 




Prioritize exact fits, fullness, & avoid division by zero; combine multiple factors with weighting.
Stronger prioritization & avoiding extremes (full/empty bins) significantly improve online bin packing performance.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and gently penalize nearly full/empty bins. Consider item order too!




Favor nuanced fit scoring & bin fullness; avoid extreme states; small bonuses help.
Prioritize fit *and* remaining space; sigmoid scaling & normalization are key for balance.
Prioritize exact fits & balance waste minimization with moderate bin fullness—avoid extremes.
Prioritize exact fits & balance fit with remaining capacity using non-linear scaling.
