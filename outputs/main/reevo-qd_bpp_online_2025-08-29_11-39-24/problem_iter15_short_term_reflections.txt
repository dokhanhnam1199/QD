Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—balance exploration & exploitation.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste, consider bin fullness, and avoid extremes.
Combine fit, inverse distance, & fullness penalties. Softmax isn't always superior; consider weighted combinations.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoid extremes! Small bonuses help too.




Prioritize simplicity & key features (exact fit!). Avoid over-engineering with complex functions initially.
Prioritize fitting, not just remaining space; consider item-to-bin *ratio* for better packing density.




Prioritize fit, explore diverse options, and normalize scores—avoiding dominance & stagnation.
Prioritize tighter fits, but balance exploitation with exploration (e.g., epsilon-greedy) for robust performance.




Reward fullness *and* penalize waste; higher scores generally lead to better bin utilization.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, avoid extremes, and normalize/smooth scores for robust bin packing.
