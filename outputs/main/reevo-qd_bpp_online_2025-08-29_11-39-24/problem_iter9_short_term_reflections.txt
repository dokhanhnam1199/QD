Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; small adjustments significantly improve bin packing performance.
Prioritize fit, normalize scores, and tune parameters—exploration helps, but informed choices are key.
Focus on snug fits, fullness, and avoid extreme bin utilizations—balance exploration & exploitation.




Prioritize smooth, normalized scores; consider item-bin *fit* beyond just remaining capacity & waste. Tune parameters!
Combine multiple scoring factors, normalize outputs, and avoid extreme bin states—consider sigmoid scaling.




Prioritize exact fits, then smallest remaining capacity; balance exploitation & exploration carefully.
Prioritize fit, but consider *how much* space is left—avoiding near-full bins improves packing.
Prioritize non-linear scoring & normalization; consider item-bin *interaction*, not just remaining capacity.
Prioritize exact fits, nuanced waste minimization, & bin fullness awareness—avoid extremes!
Prioritize exact fits, fullness, and minimal waste—balance utilization & avoid fragmentation.
