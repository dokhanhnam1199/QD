Prioritize exact fits & closeness; explore strategically, not randomly—exploit bin characteristics!
Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) & normalize scores; avoid zero-division & extreme values.
Prioritize fit, not just feasibility; softmax normalizes scores, guiding selection towards better bin utilization.
Prioritize fit *and* bin fullness; normalization & sigmoid shaping significantly improve performance.
Exploit best-fit, explore randomly, and consider bin fullness—avoiding nearly-empty bins improves packing.
Prioritize snug fits & avoid full/empty bins; simple, inverse relationships often outperform complex fits.




Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste—simplicity & direct relevance to the problem matter.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; consider bin fullness & item size differences.
Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space; avoid negative differences—a core improvement for BPP heuristics.
Prioritize bins nearing item size; avoid large gaps. Distance-based scoring often outperforms simple worst-fit approaches.
