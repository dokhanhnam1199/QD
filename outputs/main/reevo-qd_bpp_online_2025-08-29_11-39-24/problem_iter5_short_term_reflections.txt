Prioritize exact fits, waste minimization, and bin fullness—balance factors with weighting & normalization.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoid extremes! Sigmoids help nuanced scoring.




Exploit remaining capacity *and* bin fullness; avoid softmax for direct prioritization & penalization.
Prioritize bins based on *how well* an item fits, not just feasibility—consider “proximity” or remaining space.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoid extremes! Use smooth scoring (like sigmoid).




Combine exploitation (Best Fit) with controlled exploration—adjust epsilon dynamically based on performance.
Prioritize snug fits! Consider item size *and* remaining bin capacity for effective packing.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Small adjustments to priorities significantly impact performance. Consider bin fullness.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoid extremes! Sigmoids offer nuanced scoring.
Prioritize tightest fits; exact fits are key. Penalize non-fitting bins heavily.
