Your task is to write a priority function using the Inverse Distance (Proximity Fit) strategy for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

    if np.any(valid_bins):
        fit_indices = np.where(valid_bins)[0]

        priorities[fit_indices] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[fit_indices] - item + 1e-6)

[Reflection]
Prioritize exact fits & closeness; explore strategically, not randomly—exploit bin characteristics!

[Improved code]
Please write an improved function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize exact fits & closeness; explore strategically, not randomly—exploit bin characteristics!
Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) & normalize scores; avoid zero-division & extreme values.
Prioritize fit, not just feasibility; softmax normalizes scores, guiding selection towards better bin utilization.
Prioritize fit *and* bin fullness; normalization & sigmoid shaping significantly improve performance.
Exploit best-fit, explore randomly, and consider bin fullness—avoiding nearly-empty bins improves packing.
Prioritize snug fits & avoid full/empty bins; simple, inverse relationships often outperform complex fits.




Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste—simplicity & direct relevance to the problem matter.
Prioritize exact fits, then minimize waste; consider bin fullness & item size differences.
Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space; avoid negative differences—a core improvement for BPP heuristics.
Prioritize bins nearing item size; avoid large gaps. Distance-based scoring often outperforms simple worst-fit approaches.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:

**Focus:** Prioritize *exact* fits first, then minimize waste (space *and* avoiding near-empty/full bins). Use a sigmoid function to score nuanced fits & normalize – distance to item size is key! Exploit bin characteristics, not randomness.





[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Exact Fit First strategy.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    # Assign highest priority to bins that exactly fit the item
    exact_fit_bins = np.where(bins_remain_cap == item)[0]
    priorities[exact_fit_bins] = 1.0

    # If no exact fit, assign priority based on how close the bin capacity is to the item size,
    # favoring smaller bins with remaining capacity close to the item size.
    if np.sum(priorities) == 0:
        diff = np.abs(bins_remain_cap - item)
        priorities = 1.0 / (diff + 1e-6)  # Adding a small value to avoid division by zero
    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
