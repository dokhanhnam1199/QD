Prioritize exact fits strongly; consider waste *and* bin fullness for better packing. Avoid near-empty/full bins.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider remaining capacity—balance exploration & exploitation.
Prioritize exact fits & fullness; combine multiple scoring signals for improved bin utilization.




Prioritize non-linear fit, normalize scores, and avoid division by zero—crucial for stable, effective bin packing.




Prioritize simplicity & direct fit; avoid complex scaling unless demonstrably beneficial. Exact fits are key!




Simplicity often wins! Focus on directly rewarding usable space, avoiding complex scoring.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider remaining capacity—a multi-faceted approach yields better results.




Prioritize exact fits highly; combine fit & remaining space non-linearly (e.g., sigmoid) for nuanced scoring.




Prioritize tighter fits; softmax normalizes, best-fit directly rewards minimal waste—explore both approaches!
Prioritize minimizing waste *directly*; avoid explicit ranking/normalization if possible. Simplicity often wins in heuristics.
