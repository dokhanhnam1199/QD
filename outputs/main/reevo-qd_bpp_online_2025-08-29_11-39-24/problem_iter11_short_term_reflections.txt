Prioritize simplicity & strong rules (exact fit first). Avoid over-engineering with complex functions.
Prioritize exact fits & non-linearly combine fit, remaining capacity—tune exploration via scaling!
Prioritize tighter fits; explore beyond simple greedy choices, but carefully manage exploration's impact.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, avoid extremes, and use smoothing/normalization techniques.
Prioritize exact fits, balance fullness & waste using scaled exponentials/inverses, tune rates carefully.




Prioritize fit *and* explore; use non-linear scoring & normalize for balanced bin selection.
Prioritize feasibility, then density; explore occasionally, balance exploitation & exploration carefully.




Simplicity & proximity often win. Avoid complex scoring; focus on direct fit & remaining space.




Prioritize nuanced fit, waste reduction, & balance exploration with exploitation—avoiding simple greedy approaches.




Prioritize fullness *and* minimize waste; larger constants amplify desired bin selection significantly.
