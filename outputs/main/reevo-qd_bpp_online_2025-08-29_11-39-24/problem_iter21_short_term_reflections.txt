Prioritize simplicity, normalize effectively, and balance waste minimization with bin fullness—avoid complex scaling.
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and avoid overly full/empty bins—balance exploration & exploitation.
Prioritize waste minimization, bin fullness avoidance, and use smooth weighting/normalization for robust performance.




Simplicity often wins! Focus on remaining space; avoid complex scoring functions—they can hinder performance.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider bin fullness—avoiding extremes—for better packing.
Prioritize exact fits & balance waste minimization with reasonable bin fullness—avoid extremes.




Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and balance bin fullness—avoid extremes! Consider item order too.




Prioritize fit *and* explore. Sigmoid scaling + epsilon-greedy balances exploitation & discovery effectively.
Prioritize fit *and* feasibility; avoid unnecessary complexity like sigmoid when ratios suffice. Penalize near-full bins.




Prioritize exact fits, waste reduction, and moderate bin fullness—balance fit, waste, & utilization.
