Okay, let's distill this into actionable advice for designing superior heuristics, aiming for that $999K tip! Here's a breakdown:

* **Keywords:** Best-fit, Bin Utilization, Sigmoid Smoothing, Waste Minimization.
* **Advice:** Prioritize a core of best-fit, *then* refine with a smoothed (sigmoid) metric representing bin utilization/waste. Direct boosting of best-fit is preferred. Simple weighting is good starting point.
* **Avoid:** Complex calculations, arbitrary weights, normalization unless crucial, and over-reliance on exploration bonuses or reciprocal functions. Don't chase worst-case scenarios.
* **Explanation:** The analysis consistently favors clarity and direct optimization toward minimizing waste. Sigmoids offer smoothing *without* sacrificing interpretability, but excessive complexity hinders understanding and tuning.
