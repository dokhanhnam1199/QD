Okay, hereâ€™s a refined self-reflection framework aimed at designing superior heuristics, geared toward earning that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Smooth prioritization, utilization, balance (exploitation/exploration), robustness.
* **Advice:** Prioritize *smooth*, sigmoid-scaled combinations of best-fit *and* bin utilization (fill ratio). Focus on minimizing waste as the core objective, dynamically adjusting prioritization based on item/bin characteristics.
* **Avoid:** Complex weighting, arbitrary bonuses, normalization (unless demonstrably beneficial), focusing solely on worst-case scenarios, and rigid, discrete priority schemes.
* **Explanation:** Heuristics thrive on balance. Sigmoids prevent overreaction to minor differences, creating robust prioritization. Combining fit *with* utilization guides towards globally efficient packing, not just locally optimal choices.
