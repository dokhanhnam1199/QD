Reciprocal calculations and sigmoid functions demonstrate ways to quantify \u201cgoodness of fit.\u201d Avoid approaches focusing on worst-case scenarios. Always ensure that only *valid* bins are considered and that a fallback mechanism exists when no valid bins are available (returning zeros or a uniform distribution).\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
