{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nEffective bin packing heuristics benefit from combining best-fit strategies with methods to address bin utilization (fill ratios) and minimize waste. Dynamically scaling prioritization using functions like sigmoid allows for adaptation to different item sizes and bin capacities. Avoiding fixed weights and simple capacity-based prioritization is crucial for optimal performance.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for bin packing should prioritize minimizing waste. Reciprocal calculations and sigmoid functions demonstrate ways to quantify \u201cgoodness of fit.\u201d Avoid approaches focusing on worst-case scenarios. Always ensure that only *valid* bins are considered and that a fallback mechanism exists when no valid bins are available (returning zeros or a uniform distribution).\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
