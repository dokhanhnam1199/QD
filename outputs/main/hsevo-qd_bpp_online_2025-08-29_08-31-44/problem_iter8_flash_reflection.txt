**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), both utilize best-fit with a priority boost for the best bin, but the 1st uses a sigmoid to smooth prioritization across *all* feasible bins based on fill ratio, providing a more nuanced selection than the 2nd's simple 1/2 priority scheme. (3rd) and (4th) are identical to (2nd). Comparing (1st) vs (5th), (1st)’s sigmoid application is cleaner, while (5th) introduces an exploration bonus based on average remaining capacity that feels less grounded in immediate fit. (6th) is a simplified best-fit. (7th), (9th) and (10th) are identical - a more complex version of best-fit with sigmoid and bin utilization. (8th) and (11th) have a very basic best-fit and are significantly worse. (12th) adds a moderate boost to the best-fit. (13th) is similar to (7th), (9th), (10th) but simpler. (14th) introduces a complex, piecewise scoring function that seems arbitrarily tuned and the best bin prioritization is not as robust. (15th), (16th) and (17th) are identical. (18th) uses an exponential function for prioritization, which can lead to a few bins dominating, and lacks a clear rationale. (19th) and (20th) just return remaining capacity (or -1 if it doesn’t fit), fundamentally failing to prioritize. Overall, the best heuristics combine best-fit with a smoothing function (sigmoid) and consider bin utilization. Randomization (like in 2nd) is less effective without careful tuning. Simpler heuristics (6th, 8th, 11th) are outperformed by those that consider fill ratio.

**Experience:**

Prioritize smoothness in prioritization. A sigmoid function applied to fill ratios provides a more robust approach than discrete priority levels. Avoid arbitrary weighting schemes (14th) and overly complex exploration bonuses (5th). The core of effective bin packing heuristics lies in balancing immediate fit with a measure of bin utilization.
