**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the first is significantly more sophisticated, incorporating a sigmoid function to modulate priority based on fill ratio, and adding a boost to the best-fit bin. The second only provides a basic best-fit selection. Comparing 1st vs 3rd, both use best-fit, but the 1st leverages a sigmoid for fill ratio and a more nuanced prioritization, while the 3rd uses reciprocal waste, which can be less stable.

Comparing 3rd vs 4th, the 3rd combines waste with best-fit, while the 4th's fill ratio calculation is flawed (subtracting item from capacity rather than vice versa). 4th also inappropriately zeroes all priorities before setting the best. Comparing 5th and 6th reveal identical code.

Comparing 7th vs 8th, the 7th blends reciprocal waste with a sigmoid fill ratio, while the 8th introduces an 'exploration bonus' which seems interesting, but the argmax selection feels less refined.  Comparing 9th and 10th, the 9th is extremely basic while the 10th's tanh-scaled fill ratio is a decent approach, but the separate distance calculation feels redundant.

Comparing 10th and 11th reveals identical code. Comparing 12th and 18th, both are reasonably good combinations of sigmoid scaling and best fit, with 18th being slightly more elegant. 19th attempts a comprehensive approach with multiple sigmoid scores but it appears less refined. 20th attempts normalization, but it might overly simplify the prioritization.

The consistently poor performing heuristics (14th, 15th, 20th) are characterized by either extreme simplicity or flawed normalization that diminishes useful differentiation. Heuristics 1st, 7th, 16th, 17th and 18th consistently use combinations of best fit, reciprocal waste, and sigmoid scaling. These demonstrate superior performance.

Overall: Successful heuristics consistently prioritize combining best-fit with methods that consider bin utilization (fill ratio, waste). The use of sigmoid functions to modulate these scores is effective. Avoid overly complex normalization or simplistic approaches that discard vital prioritization information.  Properly handling edge cases (empty feasible bins) is vital.

**Experience:**

Effective bin-packing heuristics benefit from a blend of best-fit and utilization-based scoring. Sigmoid functions effectively translate scores into usable priorities. Avoid normalization unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize clarity and avoid redundant calculations.
