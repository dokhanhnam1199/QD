**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the 1st is simpler, focusing on best & second best fit with fixed priorities. The 2nd is more complex, introducing a smoothed utilization score (sigmoid) alongside reciprocal waste, aiming for robustness. 1st lacks adaptive weighting. Comparing 2nd vs 3rd, 3rd is just a simplified version of 1st, removing any improvements 2nd brought. Comparing 1st vs 3rd, 1st is slightly better due to providing a second best option.

Comparing 4th vs 5th, they are identical. Comparing 4th/5th vs 6th, 6th employs a logarithmic transformation of fit score and a more direct weighting, attempting to refine the best-fit prioritization, while 4th/5th are less direct. Comparing 6th vs 7th, 7th reintroduces the sigmoid, adding complexity without clear benefit over 6th.

Comparing 8th/9th (identical) vs 10th/11th (identical), 8th/9th combine smoothed fit and utilization, but weighting towards fit (0.6). 10th/11th introduce an exploration bonus based on exceeding average remaining capacity, potentially aiding in delaying fragmentation. 8th/9th is superior in consistently applying principles.

Comparing 12th vs 13th/14th/15th, 12th is the most concise—direct reciprocal waste. 13th is minimal (returns zeros). 14th/15th attempt combined sigmoid & fit scores, but are more convoluted. 12th's simplicity is an asset.

Comparing 16th vs 17th, 16th combines sigmoid and waste scores with weights, offering more nuance than 17th’s basic fill ratio. 17th’s linear fill ratio is less effective. 18th is unnecessarily complex with imports. 19th combines sigmoid with fit score, but less clearly defined weighting. 20th uses a similar structure to 19th.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 2nd, 6th, 8th/9th, 12th, 16th) effectively combine best-fit principles with elements to improve bin utilization or prevent fragmentation. The worst (13th, 17th, 18th) are either minimal or overly complex with little justification. Sigmoid functions generally improve outcomes when combined with other metrics, but require careful weighting.

**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and clear weighting schemes. Sigmoid functions can be useful for smoothing scores but avoid excessive complexity. A good starting point is best-fit combined with a utilization-based component, using a relatively simple weighting. Don't overcomplicate with unnecessary calculations or imports.
