Okay, here's a breakdown to redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for superior heuristic design, aiming for that $999K tip!

* **Keywords:** Simplicity, Smoothness, Utilization, Best-Fit.
* **Advice:** Focus on combining best-fit *with* a utilization score (bin fill ratio). Use sigmoid functions to *smooth* the resulting priorities—this avoids harsh jumps. Prioritize clear, explainable weighting.
* **Avoid:** Complex calculations, arbitrary weights, reciprocal calculations (unless *very* carefully considered), and normalization if avoidable. Don’t chase worst-case performance.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren’t about perfect solutions, but *consistently good* ones. Smooth prioritization via sigmoids, built on a solid best-fit/utilization foundation, delivers robust, understandable results.
