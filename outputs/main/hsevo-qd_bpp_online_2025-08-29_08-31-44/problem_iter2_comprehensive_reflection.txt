Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design guidance. Here’s a breakdown, geared toward maximizing effectiveness (and aiming for that $999K!):

* **Keywords:** *Fit quantification, Valid state space, Fallback, Adaptive scoring.*
* **Advice:** Focus on *measuring* bin utilization (sigmoid/reciprocal are good starts). Dynamically adjust scoring based on item size & remaining bin space.
* **Avoid:** Catastrophizing (worst-case analysis hinders practical performance).  Ignoring bin validity – always check constraints *before* attempting placement.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren’t about guaranteeing perfection, but consistently achieving *good* solutions. Validating each step & having a graceful failure mode (fallback) prevents errors and stagnation.
