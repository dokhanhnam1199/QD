**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the core difference lies in how the best-fit boost is applied. The 1st uses a sigmoid on fill ratios *and* adds a boost to the best fit, creating a more nuanced prioritization. The 2nd resets priorities and then boosts the best fit, potentially losing information from the fill ratio evaluation.  Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the 1st uses max bin capacity to normalize fill ratio, while the 3rd uses the item size to normalize fit scores which can lead to instability with small items.  Comparing 3rd vs 4th, the 4th is simpler, relying solely on reciprocal waste and best-fit, making it less adaptable. The 3rd attempts to smooth with a fill ratio, but it's less effective than the sigmoid in 1st. Comparing 4th vs 5th, the 5th is a slight improvement, explicitly setting the best-fit index, but the core reciprocal waste approach remains limiting. Comparing 6th/7th vs 8th, 6th/7th introduces weights, but are identical. 8th is a very basic reciprocal waste.  Comparing 9th vs 10th, 9th attempts to combine sigmoid with waste, and 10th only has a waste component that causes unstable results. Comparing 11th vs 12th, 11th uses tuned parameters, but is still limited to reciprocal waste. 12th uses the worst fit capacity as priority which is counter intuitive.  Comparing 13th vs 14th, 13th is an improvement over 14th because it combines with reciprocal waste. Comparing 15th vs 16th, both incorporate sigmoid and fit scores, but 16th has a weighted combination which is more effective. Comparing 16th vs 17th, they are identical.  Comparing 17th vs 18th, 18th adds a boost to the best bin which is redundant and doesn't enhance performance. Comparing 19th vs 20th, they are identical. Overall, the best heuristics combine best-fit with a smoothed prioritization (like sigmoid) based on fill ratio and a degree of normalization. The use of fixed weights (like in 6th/7th) is less effective than adaptive weighting or sigmoid functions. Purely reciprocal waste or best-fit strategies are significantly worse.

**Experience:**

Successful heuristics balance exploiting the best immediate fit with exploring opportunities for future packing efficiency. Combining multiple scoring metrics (best-fit, fill ratio, waste) and normalizing or weighting them using sigmoids or other smoothing functions yields superior results. Avoid simplistic approaches like pure reciprocal waste; nuanced evaluation is key.
