**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` in the 1st heuristic vs the 9th, 13th, 14th, 16th heuristics (all returning just zeros), the 1st attempts a best-fit approach, prioritizing the bin with the least remaining capacity *after* placing the item. The others are effectively random, offering no guidance.  Comparing the 1st vs the 2nd, both try to find valid bins, but the 2nd uses a reciprocal of the remaining waste, promoting tighter packing. The 3rd and 6th, and 12th do the same thing.

Comparing the 2nd vs the 4th, 5th, 8th, they differ only in minor code structure (checking `np.sum` vs `np.any`), but functionally are identical. The 11th attempts a sigmoid fit, scaling priority based on how well the item fits, offering more nuance. The 17th & 18th use sigmoid too but with sorting based on bin capacity. The 19th uses an exponential function. The 10th and 15th prioritize based on the *worst* fit capacity, which is counterintuitive and likely performs poorly.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st - 3rd) strategically consider remaining capacity.  Reciprocal waste (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th) is a strong signal. Sigmoid scaling (11th, 17th, 18th) tries to capture fit quality, though its effectiveness depends on parameter tuning. Prioritizing based on worst fit (10th, 15th) appears flawed.  The heuristics that simply return zeros (9th, 13th, 14th, 16th) are fundamentally useless.

**Experience:**

Effective heuristics for bin packing should prioritize minimizing waste. Reciprocal calculations and sigmoid functions demonstrate ways to quantify “goodness of fit.” Avoid approaches focusing on worst-case scenarios. Always ensure that only *valid* bins are considered and that a fallback mechanism exists when no valid bins are available (returning zeros or a uniform distribution).
