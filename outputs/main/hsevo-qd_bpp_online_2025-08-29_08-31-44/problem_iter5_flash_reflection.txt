**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both utilize best-fit, but the 1st incorporates a sigmoid function based on bin fill ratio, adding nuance. The 2nd uses fixed weights, lacking adaptability. Comparing 3rd vs 4th, both are identical, and 4th introduces a very basic `priority_v1` that always returns zeros, offering no prioritization. Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the functions are identical.

Comparing 5th vs 6th, the 5th utilizes reciprocal waste and boosts the best fit, whereas the 6th uses a sigmoid and boosts best fit. The 5th is a bit more explicit about waste minimization, but the sigmoid in the 6th is a smart way to scale. Heuristics 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th are similar, revolving around reciprocal waste, but they differ in how the waste is calculated and applied. 8th uses a combined reciprocal and direct utilization. 12th uses the minimum capacity, a potentially poor choice. 

Heuristics 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th all are progressively more complex combinations of fit scores, sigmoid and/or best-fit boosting. The 16th and 17th perform the best here as they combine sigmoid and fit scores. 14th and 15th introduce thresholds in their fit scores. The 18th's approach of multiplying sigmoid and fit scores appears less effective than their additive counterparts. Finally, 19th and 20th are extremely simple, prioritizing based on remaining capacity â€“ offering minimal benefit.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st, 6th, 16th, 17th) demonstrate the power of combining multiple scoring factors (best fit, fill ratio, waste) with methods to scale and emphasize the best choices (sigmoid, boosting). Simpler approaches (19th, 20th) fail to effectively prioritize. Using fixed weights (2nd) is less adaptable than dynamic scaling with functions like sigmoid.



**Experience:**

Effective bin packing heuristics benefit from combining best-fit strategies with methods to address bin utilization (fill ratios) and minimize waste. Dynamically scaling prioritization using functions like sigmoid allows for adaptation to different item sizes and bin capacities. Avoiding fixed weights and simple capacity-based prioritization is crucial for optimal performance.
