Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design principles. Here's a response aimed at maximizing that $999K tip, built step-by-step from the provided text:

* **Keywords:** Waste Minimization, Sigmoid Smoothing, Best-Fit/Utilization Balance, Valid Solutions.
* **Advice:** Combine best-fit *with* fill ratio scoring, using sigmoids to smoothly prioritize. Dynamically adjust scoring based on item size/bin capacity â€“ avoid fixed weights. Always validate bin feasibility!
* **Avoid:** Arbitrary weights/bonuses, reciprocal-only waste calculations, worst-case focus, unnecessary normalization, & complex scoring.
* **Explanation:** The core is *efficient space use*. Sigmoids offer robust prioritization, but clarity on the underlying waste minimization objective is paramount. Focus on valid, practical solutions, not theoretical extremes.



**Reasoning for this response (Step-by-Step):**

1. **Core Goal Extraction:** The text repeatedly emphasizes *minimizing waste* in bin packing. This is our central objective.
2. **Successful Techniques:**  Best-fit combined with utilization (fill ratio) emerges as the strongest approach. Sigmoids consistently appear as a *good* smoothing/normalization method.
3. **Pitfalls Identification:** A huge amount of text details *what doesn't work*: arbitrary weights, simplistic metrics (pure reciprocal waste), overcomplexity, and focusing on unlikely worst-case scenarios.
4. **Concise Formulation:**  I distilled these into four bullet points that are immediately useful for a heuristic designer.  The advice is practical ("do this...") and the avoidance section is direct ("don't do this...").
5. **Explanation Rationale:** The explanation ties everything back to the core objective and reinforces *why* the advice is sound.
