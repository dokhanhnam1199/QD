**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, the 1st uses a sigmoid function to prioritize based on fill ratio *before* applying best-fit, resulting in a smoother prioritization. The 2nd is a very basic best-fit and lacks any nuance.  Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the 3rd normalizes fill ratios and adds them to fit differences, but lacks the smoothing effect of the sigmoid.  Comparing 3rd vs 4th, both combine best-fit with waste, but 4th's simple reciprocal waste is less adaptable than 3rd’s fill ratio approach.

Comparing 4th vs 5th, they are identical. Heuristics 6th-10th build upon the waste/fit combination, adding variations in weighting and sigmoid scaling, but often with less clear rationale. Heuristics 11th-13th are very similar to earlier approaches, adding slight modifications to the scoring. Heuristics 14th-17th generally show improvement over earlier heuristics with combinations of fit and utilization with sigmoid. Heuristics 18th-20th introduce smoothing with sigmoid function that appears to perform well. 

The 1st heuristic’s prioritization based on fill ratio before applying best fit seems a strong strategy. The best heuristics (1st, 14th, 18th, 20th) consistently utilize sigmoid functions to smooth the prioritization, suggesting that handling extreme values in fit or utilization scores is important.  The consistent use of `1e-6` or `1e-9` to avoid division by zero is good practice.  Heuristics 12th is a minimal/incomplete example.

Overall: The most successful heuristics combine best-fit with some measure of bin utilization or waste, and importantly, smooth the prioritization using a sigmoid function. Initial prioritization by fill ratio before best-fit search also seems beneficial.

**Experience:**

Prioritize smoothing prioritization scores using sigmoid functions to avoid being overly sensitive to small differences in fit or waste. Combining best-fit with a utilization-based score yields better results. Avoid overly complex weighting schemes unless clearly justified by experimentation. Always handle potential division-by-zero errors.
