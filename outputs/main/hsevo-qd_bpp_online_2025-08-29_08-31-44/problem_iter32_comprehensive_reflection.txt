Okay, here's a breakdown for designing superior heuristics, aiming for that $999K tip! This is built from distilling the provided self-reflection, focusing on actionable guidance.

*   **Keywords:** Best-Fit, Bin Utilization, Sigmoid Smoothing, Simplicity.
*   **Advice:** Combine best-fit placement *with* a utilization score (fill ratio/waste). Employ sigmoid functions to smooth this utilization score into a prioritization value. Prioritize clear, direct optimization of fill ratio post-placement.
*   **Avoid:** Complex weighting schemes, arbitrary bonuses, normalization *unless* essential, worst-case focus, and unnecessary calculations/imports.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren’t about perfect theoretical complexity; they’re about robust, practical performance. Prioritizing a good initial fit (best-fit) and then *smoothly* refining it with bin utilization maximizes packing efficiency without oversensitivity. Simplicity aids interpretability & generalization.
