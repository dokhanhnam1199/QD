{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nPrioritize combining best-fit with smoothing functions (like sigmoid) applied to normalized utilization or waste. Avoid arbitrary weights; if weights are used, tune them carefully with cross-validation. Simplicity is valuable; avoid unnecessary complexity or randomness. Focus on robust solutions that generalize well.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nEffective heuristics for bin packing should prioritize minimizing waste. Reciprocal calculations and sigmoid functions demonstrate ways to quantify \u201cgoodness of fit.\u201d Avoid approaches focusing on worst-case scenarios. Always ensure that only *valid* bins are considered and that a fallback mechanism exists when no valid bins are available (returning zeros or a uniform distribution).\n\nEffective bin packing heuristics benefit from combining best-fit strategies with methods to address bin utilization (fill ratios) and minimize waste. Dynamically scaling prioritization using functions like sigmoid allows for adaptation to different item sizes and bin capacities. Avoiding fixed weights and simple capacity-based prioritization is crucial for optimal performance.\n\nPrioritize smoothness in prioritization. A sigmoid function applied to fill ratios provides a more robust approach than discrete priority levels. Avoid arbitrary weighting schemes (14th) and overly complex exploration bonuses (5th). The core of effective bin packing heuristics lies in balancing immediate fit with a measure of bin utilization.\n\nSuccessful heuristics balance exploiting the best immediate fit with exploring opportunities for future packing efficiency. Combining multiple scoring metrics (best-fit, fill ratio, waste) and normalizing or weighting them using sigmoids or other smoothing functions yields superior results. Avoid simplistic approaches like pure reciprocal waste; nuanced evaluation is key.\n\nEffective bin-packing heuristics benefit from a blend of best-fit and utilization-based scoring. Sigmoid functions effectively translate scores into usable priorities. Avoid normalization unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize clarity and avoid redundant calculations.\n\nPrioritize simplicity and a clear objective function (minimize waste).  Combining multiple scoring components requires careful weighting and a principled approach. Sigmoid smoothing can be useful for normalizing scores, but it shouldn\u2019t obscure the underlying optimization goal. Avoid introducing arbitrary biases or exploration bonuses without careful analysis.\n\nPrioritize smoothing prioritization scores using sigmoid functions to avoid being overly sensitive to small differences in fit or waste. Combining best-fit with a utilization-based score yields better results. Avoid overly complex weighting schemes unless clearly justified by experimentation. Always handle potential division-by-zero errors.\n\nPrioritize simplicity and clear weighting schemes. Sigmoid functions can be useful for smoothing scores but avoid excessive complexity. A good starting point is best-fit combined with a utilization-based component, using a relatively simple weighting. Don't overcomplicate with unnecessary calculations or imports.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
