**Analysis:**

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v2` (2nd), the key difference is the application of the sigmoid function *after* calculating reciprocal waste in the first version, while the second applies it to a fit score derived from fill ratio *before* multiplying by the reciprocal waste. The first approach allows the reciprocal waste to heavily influence the priority, with the sigmoid smoothing merely adjusting the magnitude. The second has the sigmoid shaping the fit score *before* combining, potentially limiting the impact of extreme waste scenarios.

Comparing `priority_v2` (1st) vs `priority_v2` (3rd), the first uses waste directly, while the third uses fill ratio. The fill ratio approach in the 3rd heuristic is less sensitive to the absolute size of the item relative to the bin, focusing more on the proportion of the bin used.  The first, being more directly tied to waste, is likely better at minimizing fragmentation.

Comparing `priority_v2` (4th) vs `priority_v2` (5th), the 4th attempts a weighted combination of fit and utilization scores, both smoothed with sigmoid functions. The 5th is extremely basic, essentially best-fit only. The 4th is far more sophisticated and likely to produce better results.

Comparing `priority_v2` (6th) vs `priority_v2` (7th), both combine reciprocal waste and a fit score, but the 7th introduces an "exploration bonus" based on comparing bin capacity to the average. This bonus adds some randomness, which *could* help escape local optima but also introduces instability. The 6th is likely more consistent.

Comparing `priority_v2` (8th) vs `priority_v2` (9th), the 8th combines reciprocal waste and a sigmoid-based fit score, while the 9th offers a very basic reciprocal waste calculation. The 8th adds a layer of smoothing and is clearly superior.

Comparing `priority_v2` (10th) vs `priority_v2` (11th), both use sigmoid scaling. The 10th includes a fill ratio, while the 11th uses bin utilization. The 11th integrates the fit and utilization within the sigmoid more directly.

The heuristics 12th, 13th, and 14th have some imports like torch and scipy, and very short docstrings, likely indicating incomplete or experimental designs.

Heuristics 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th all try to combine multiple scoring mechanisms (fit, utilization, waste) and frequently use sigmoid functions for smoothing. However, the weighting schemes are often arbitrary, and the logic to identify the best bin (e.g., `np.argmax`) is applied *after* some combination of scores, potentially masking the influence of individual components. They feel less principled than the top-ranked heuristics.  The late introduction of a bias (e.g., adding 0.5 to the best bin) is also a sign of ad-hoc adjustments.

Overall: The most successful heuristics (1st-3rd) prioritize minimizing waste and using a tightest-fit approach, potentially with a smoothing factor. Later heuristics become more complex but often lose focus on the core optimization goal. The use of sigmoid functions is common, but it’s most effective when applied to refine a clear primary scoring function (e.g., waste). Randomness/exploration (as in heuristic 7th) should be used cautiously.



**Experience:**

Prioritize simplicity and a clear objective function (minimize waste).  Combining multiple scoring components requires careful weighting and a principled approach. Sigmoid smoothing can be useful for normalizing scores, but it shouldn’t obscure the underlying optimization goal. Avoid introducing arbitrary biases or exploration bonuses without careful analysis.
