**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, we see heuristic 1st uses a simpler priority assignment with 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0, while 2nd introduces weighted parameters (weight_1, weight_2) but doesnâ€™t demonstrably improve performance - the weights seem arbitrary.  (3rd) vs (4th) shows a move towards smoothing with a sigmoid function, and (4th) is a very basic, almost placeholder implementation. (5th) unnecessarily resets priorities after initially assigning them.  (6th) introduces randomness, which is generally undesirable for deterministic heuristic performance. (7th/8th/9th/10th) all explore sigmoid smoothing combined with best-fit/waste considerations, but are largely redundant, variations on the same themes. (11th) and (12th) focus on reciprocal waste, which is a good starting point but often benefits from normalization or smoothing.  (13th) combines reciprocal waste and an added constant, which is slightly better.  (14th) is incomplete. (15th/16th) demonstrate the use of sigmoid, but the fit score calculation in (15th) `(bins_remain_cap[possible_bins] - item) / bins_remain_cap[possible_bins]` might prioritize almost-full bins unnecessarily. (17th) shows combining sigmoid and waste scores.  (18th) adds tunable sigmoid parameters.  (19th/20th) combine sigmoid, fit scores, and a final boost to the best bin, exhibiting a reasonable approach, but potentially prone to overfitting to specific datasets. Overall, the best heuristics effectively combine best-fit (minimizing waste) with normalization (to prevent bias towards large bins) and smoothing (to avoid overly sharp prioritization). Randomness should be avoided.

**Experience:**

Prioritize combining best-fit with smoothing functions (like sigmoid) applied to normalized utilization or waste. Avoid arbitrary weights; if weights are used, tune them carefully with cross-validation. Simplicity is valuable; avoid unnecessary complexity or randomness. Focus on robust solutions that generalize well.
