**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic (`priority_v2`) uses a simpler, more direct approach, prioritizing the best fit and then a secondary fit. The second one is overly complex with fill ratios, utilization scores and multiple normalizations that don't seem to contribute much value. (3rd) vs (4th) - the 3rd is more concise than 4th, avoiding unnecessary sigmoid calculations and combined scores. (5th) vs (6th) - 5th uses a sigmoid on reciprocal waste, while 6th is extremely basic, only assigning priorities if a bin fits. (7th) vs (8th) - 7th introduces weights which require tuning, while 8th attempts to combine smooth fit & utilization, leading to a less interpretable score. (9th) vs (10th) - 9th offers a direct reciprocal waste prioritization while 10th overcomplicates things with unnecessary fill ratio and combined scores. (11th) vs (12th) - 11th’s combination of reciprocal waste and sigmoid on fill ratio seems more promising than 12th’s simple sum of reciprocal waste and reciprocal capacity. (13th) is essentially a duplicate of 10th. (14th) vs (15th) – 14th is more direct, using sigmoid on best fit index, while 15th has more calculations but doesn't provide better result. (16th) is overly simple and only checks feasibility. (17th) introduces a boost to the best fit, which can be useful. (18th) attempts to combine sigmoid with best fit but introduces an unclear `fit_scores` calculation. (19th) is overly complicated with multiple sigmoid functions, and a strange final prioritization step. (20th) has a complex series of calculations with normalization that ultimately prioritizes a single best bin, potentially losing the benefit of exploring other options. Overall, simpler heuristics that directly prioritize best fit, potentially with a smoothness factor (sigmoid) or a secondary fit consideration, perform better than complex combinations of metrics and scores.  Avoiding unnecessary normalization and focusing on clear prioritization signals is crucial.

**Experience:**

Favor simplicity and directness in heuristic design. Prioritize the most relevant factors (best fit, bin utilization) and avoid over-engineering with complex calculations or numerous parameters. Sigmoid functions can smooth prioritization, but overuse diminishes interpretability. Directly boosting the best fit is effective.
