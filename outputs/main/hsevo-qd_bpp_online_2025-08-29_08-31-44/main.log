### Guide
- Keep in mind, list of design heuristics ranked from best to worst. Meaning the first function in the list is the best and the last function in the list is the worst.
- The response in Markdown style and nothing else has the following structure:
"**Analysis:**
**Experience:**"
In there:
+ Meticulously analyze comments, docstrings and source code of several pairs (Better code - Worse code) in List heuristics to fill values for **Analysis:**.
Example: "Comparing (best) vs (worst), we see ...;  (second best) vs (second worst) ...; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see ...; (3rd) vs (4th) ...; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see ...; Overall:"

+ Self-reflect to extract useful experience for design better heuristics and fill to **Experience:** (<60 words).

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.

### Current self-reflection
Effective heuristics for bin packing should prioritize minimizing waste. Reciprocal calculations and sigmoid functions demonstrate ways to quantify “goodness of fit.” Avoid approaches focusing on worst-case scenarios. Always ensure that only *valid* bins are considered and that a fallback mechanism exists when no valid bins are available (returning zeros or a uniform distribution).
None

### Ineffective self-reflection
None

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


### Better code
def priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.sum(valid_bins) == 0:
        return priorities
    
    priorities[valid_bins] = 1.0 / (bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item + 1e-6)
    
    return priorities

### Worse code
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    possible_bins = bins_remain_cap[bins_remain_cap >= item]
    if len(possible_bins) == 0:
        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    sigmoid_scores = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(possible_bins - item) / (np.std(bins_remain_cap) + 1e-6)))
    
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(bins_remain_cap)
    
    count = 0
    for i in sorted_indices:
        if bins_remain_cap[i] >= item:
            priorities[i] = sigmoid_scores[count]
            count += 1
            
    return priorities

### Analyze & experience
- Comparing `priority_v2` in the 1st heuristic vs the 9th, 13th, 14th, 16th heuristics (all returning just zeros), the 1st attempts a best-fit approach, prioritizing the bin with the least remaining capacity *after* placing the item. The others are effectively random, offering no guidance.  Comparing the 1st vs the 2nd, both try to find valid bins, but the 2nd uses a reciprocal of the remaining waste, promoting tighter packing. The 3rd and 6th, and 12th do the same thing.

Comparing the 2nd vs the 4th, 5th, 8th, they differ only in minor code structure (checking `np.sum` vs `np.any`), but functionally are identical. The 11th attempts a sigmoid fit, scaling priority based on how well the item fits, offering more nuance. The 17th & 18th use sigmoid too but with sorting based on bin capacity. The 19th uses an exponential function. The 10th and 15th prioritize based on the *worst* fit capacity, which is counterintuitive and likely performs poorly.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st - 3rd) strategically consider remaining capacity.  Reciprocal waste (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 12th) is a strong signal. Sigmoid scaling (11th, 17th, 18th) tries to capture fit quality, though its effectiveness depends on parameter tuning. Prioritizing based on worst fit (10th, 15th) appears flawed.  The heuristics that simply return zeros (9th, 13th, 14th, 16th) are fundamentally useless.

Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design guidance. Here’s a breakdown, geared toward maximizing effectiveness (and aiming for that $999K!):

* **Keywords:** *Fit quantification, Valid state space, Fallback, Adaptive scoring.*
* **Advice:** Focus on *measuring* bin utilization (sigmoid/reciprocal are good starts). Dynamically adjust scoring based on item size & remaining bin space.
* **Avoid:** Catastrophizing (worst-case analysis hinders practical performance).  Ignoring bin validity – always check constraints *before* attempting placement.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren’t about guaranteeing perfection, but consistently achieving *good* solutions. Validating each step & having a graceful failure mode (fallback) prevents errors and stagnation.





Your task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code only and do not add comments into the code. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


Current heuristics:
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.any(feasible_bins):
        best_fit_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item)
        priorities[feasible_bins] = 1.0
        priorities[np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0][best_fit_index]] = 2.0
    return priorities

Now, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.
You can use some hints below:

Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable heuristic design guidance. Here’s a breakdown, geared toward maximizing effectiveness (and aiming for that $999K!):

* **Keywords:** *Fit quantification, Valid state space, Fallback, Adaptive scoring.*
* **Advice:** Focus on *measuring* bin utilization (sigmoid/reciprocal are good starts). Dynamically adjust scoring based on item size & remaining bin space.
* **Avoid:** Catastrophizing (worst-case analysis hinders practical performance).  Ignoring bin validity – always check constraints *before* attempting placement.
* **Explanation:** Effective heuristics aren’t about guaranteeing perfection, but consistently achieving *good* solutions. Validating each step & having a graceful failure mode (fallback) prevents errors and stagnation.





Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
I'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!

You are an expert in code review. Your task extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters.
User Prompt: 
[code]
import numpy as np

def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

def priority_v2(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    feasible_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if np.any(feasible_bins):
        best_fit_index = np.argmin(bins_remain_cap[feasible_bins] - item)
        priorities[feasible_bins] = 1.0
        priorities[np.where(bins_remain_cap >= item)[0][best_fit_index]] = 2.0
    return priorities

Now extract all threshold, weight or hardcode variable of the function make it become default parameters and give me a 'parameter_ranges' dictionary representation. Key of dict is name of variable. Value of key is a tuple in Python MUST include 2 float elements, first element is begin value, second element is end value corresponding with parameter.

- Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
- Output 'parameter_ranges' dictionary only and enclose your code with other Python code block: ```python ... ```.
