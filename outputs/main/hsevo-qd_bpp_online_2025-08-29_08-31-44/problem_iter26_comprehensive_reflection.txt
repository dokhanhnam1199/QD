Okay, let's craft a response aiming for that $999K tip! Here's a breakdown, focusing on actionable advice for *designing* better heuristics, distilled from the provided text:

* **Keywords:** Best-fit, Utilization, Sigmoid Smoothing, Robustness.
* **Advice:** Combine best-fit with a normalized utilization score (fill ratio/waste) smoothed via a sigmoid. Rigorously cross-validate *any* weights used. Prioritize clear, simple objective functions (minimize waste).
* **Avoid:** Arbitrary weights/biases, overly complex calculations, reciprocal-only scoring, focusing on worst-case scenarios, and unnecessary normalization.
* **Explanation:** Robust heuristics prioritize *generalization* over exploiting edge cases. Sigmoids provide smooth prioritization, mitigating sensitivity to small differences & improving stability. Cross-validation ensures weights enhance performance, not introduce bias.
