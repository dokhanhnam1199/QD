Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable advice for designing superior heuristics, especially focusing on avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection." Here’s a breakdown, aiming for that $999K tip!

**Step-by-Step Thought Process:**

The core insight is *smooth, adaptive prioritization* based on quantifiable "goodness of fit" – balancing immediate placement with long-term bin utilization.  We want to move *away* from rigid rules and towards continuous evaluation.  The provided text explicitly warns against arbitrary weights and over-complication.  The emphasis on valid bins and fallback mechanisms points to the importance of robustness.

**Refined Self-Reflection & Heuristic Design Advice:**

*   **Keywords:** Smooth Prioritization, Fill Ratio, Adaptive Scaling, Robustness
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics using continuous functions (e.g., sigmoid) to prioritize items based on fit *and* remaining bin capacity.  Dynamically adjust prioritization; don't use static weights.
*   **Avoid:** Discrete priority levels, arbitrary weighting, worst-case scenario focus, neglecting bin validity, complex exploration bonuses.
*   **Explanation:**  Continuous functions create a smoother search space, enabling adaptation to varying problem instances. Valid bin checks & fallbacks guarantee solution feasibility & avoid errors, improving heuristic reliability.
