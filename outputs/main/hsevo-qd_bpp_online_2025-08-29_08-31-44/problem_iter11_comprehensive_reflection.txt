Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" into actionable advice for heuristic design, targeting that $999K! Here's a breakdown, focusing on *why* things work (or don't) in optimization, and geared towards building genuinely superior heuristics:

*   **Keywords:** Dynamic Prioritization, Multi-objective Optimization, Smooth Functions, Constraint Validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics with *adaptable* scoring. Combine metrics (fit, utilization, waste) using smooth, normalizing functions (sigmoids are excellent) allowing relative importance to shift based on problem state.
*   **Avoid:** Static weights, reciprocal-only approaches, and focusing solely on worst-case performance. Also, bypass overly complex 'exploration' terms; simplicity often wins.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics arenâ€™t about finding *the* best immediate solution, but *consistently good* solutions. Smooth prioritization prevents getting stuck in local optima while ensuring feasible placements. Validate constraints *always*.



**Step-by-step thought process behind this:**

1.  **Distilled Core Idea:** Both texts emphasize balancing immediate fit with long-term efficiency (bin utilization/waste). This is a classic exploitation-exploration trade-off.
2.  **Smoothness is Key:**  The repeated emphasis on sigmoids isn't arbitrary. Discontinuous functions create abrupt shifts in behavior, hindering exploration. Smoothness = gradual adaptation.
3.  **Multi-Objective is Necessary:** Bin packing *is* inherently multi-objective. Focusing on a single metric (like just waste) is almost guaranteed to fail.
4.  **Constraint Handling:**  A heuristic that generates invalid solutions is worse than a simple one. Constraint validation is non-negotiable.
5. **Dynamic Prioritization:** The ideal balance between different metrics (fit, waste, utilization) changes as the problem evolves. The weights/priorities should adapt.
