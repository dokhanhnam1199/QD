**Analysis:**

Comparing heuristics 1st vs 2nd, both combine best-fit with smoothed prioritization, but the 1st uses a sigmoid on fill ratios, focusing on how *full* bins will be *after* placement, while the 2nd uses reciprocal waste and a sigmoid on overall fill ratios. The 1st appears more targeted at minimizing fragmentation by prioritizing bins that will be closer to full after the item is placed.

Comparing heuristics 3rd vs 4th, both use a sigmoid on utilization, but 3rd applies it to the remaining capacity, while 4th directly combines fit score and utilization with a sigmoid. 4th appears more complex, attempting a weighted average.

Comparing 1st vs 3rd, the 1st's fill ratio approach seems cleaner and more directly addresses packing density. The 3rd's utilization calculation seems less directly relevant to the immediate packing decision.

Comparing 5th vs 6th, both are similar - sigmoid smoothing of fill ratios/waste. However 5th normalizes fill ratios and 6th uses max capacity. 6th is better because it uses max capacity for normalization.

Comparing 7th vs 8th, 7th focuses solely on reciprocal waste while 8th introduces randomness and attempts to penalize worst-fit. 7th is simpler and more consistent.

Comparing 9th vs 10th, both combine fit and utilization with sigmoid scaling. 10th is better as it has more balanced weights between sigmoid score and reciprocal waste.

Heuristics 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th and 20th are largely ineffective or overly simplistic, often only returning a base priority or failing to effectively consider bin utilization. Heuristics 16th and 19th are duplicates.

Overall: The best heuristics (1st - 4th) prioritize a balance between best-fit and utilization, often leveraging sigmoid functions for smoothing and prioritization. The consistent theme is favoring bins that will result in higher overall density.  Later heuristics tend to be either too simplistic or add complexity without clear benefits.  The use of reciprocal waste is common, and combining it with utilization scores, smoothed by a sigmoid, seems to yield the best results.

**Experience:**

Prioritize clear objectives (density, fragmentation) when designing heuristics. Sigmoid functions are valuable for smoothing scores and introducing non-linearity. Directly optimizing for fill ratio after item placement seems superior to broader utilization calculations. Simpler heuristics consistently outperform complex ones without clear theoretical justification.
