BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin.

Then, score bins by inverse remaining capacity *and* item density \u2013 avoid zero-division! Use a sharpened sigmoid for nuanced fit, favoring nearly-full bins.
