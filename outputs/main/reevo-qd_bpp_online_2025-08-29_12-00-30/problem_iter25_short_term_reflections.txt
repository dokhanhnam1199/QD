Prioritize exact fits, target ~70% fullness, & reduce randomnessâ€”balance exploitation & exploration.
Simplicity & normalization often win. Focus on core fit, tune steepness, avoid over-exploration.
Prioritize tighter fits & target ~50% fullness; reduce randomness & empty bin penalties.




Combine best-fit & fullness; penalize unused capacity; avoid division by zero.
Explore exploration-exploitation trade-offs (like Epsilon-Greedy) & simple, focused scoring functions. Avoid complex, tuned weights.




Prioritize fill ratio & exact fits; use smooth, tunable functions (like sigmoid) for nuanced bin selection.
Stronger prioritization (exact fit > minimal waste) & simplicity often outperform complex exploration schemes.
Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) & avoid zero-capacity bins; scaling matters significantly.
Prioritize tighter fits & fuller bins; avoid empty space & discourage unusable bins.
Prioritize fit, bin fullness (around 70%), and avoid empty bins; add controlled randomness for exploration.
