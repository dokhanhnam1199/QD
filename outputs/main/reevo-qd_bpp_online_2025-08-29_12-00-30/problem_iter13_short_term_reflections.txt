Prioritize exact fits, balance fullness, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.
Prioritize exact fits, balance exploitation & exploration, and carefully tune randomness/weights. 




Prioritize exact fits, consider bin fullness, and add controlled randomness for exploration & exploitation.
Prioritize exact fits, consider bin density, and use logarithmic scoring for remaining capacity. Exploration isn't always key.




Combine exact fit preference with remaining capacity scaling; avoid overly simplistic approaches like Worst Fit.
Combine exploitation (best fit, full bins) with exploration (randomness) & consider item characteristics.
Prioritize tighter fits, but consider bin usage history & future item sizes.
Prioritize exact fits & tightest remaining space; simple, direct approaches often outperform complex scaling.




Focus on minimizing wasted space & consider only feasible bins for efficiency. Add exploration cautiously.




Prioritize beyond simple fit; consider fullness, exact matches, and controlled exploration via randomness.
