Prioritize normalization, tunable parameters, and consider bin fullness—not just remaining capacity—for better fit.




Prioritize exact fits, consider bin fullness (log scale), & item density for better packing.
Prioritize proximity fit; consider bin fullness *and* minimizing fragmentation—avoiding both very full & very empty bins.




Exploration (epsilon-greedy) & exploiting best-fit often outperform simple weighted combinations. Consider dynamic epsilon values.
Prioritize feasibility first, then minimize wasted space—simplicity & directness often outperform complex scoring.




Prioritize tighter fits; randomness alone is weak. Consider remaining capacity, not just feasibility.
Prioritize remaining capacity *and* fit; avoid purely greedy or random exploration. Consider logarithmic scaling.




Prioritize tightest fits—exact matches & minimal waste—and avoid division by zero issues.
Combine exploitation (best fit) with controlled exploration—randomness helps escape local optima. Consider bin fullness too.
Prioritize tighter fits, consider bin fullness, and avoid zero-priority scenarios for better packing.
