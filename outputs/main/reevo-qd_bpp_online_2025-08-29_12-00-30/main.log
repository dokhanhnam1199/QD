Your task is to write a priority function using the Inverse Distance (Proximity Fit) strategy for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below are two priority functions for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

System Prompt: 
You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.

User Prompt: 
Below is your prior long-term reflection on designing heuristics for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.


Below are some newly gained insights.
Prioritize fit quality *and* remaining space; avoid random exploration unless strategically beneficial.
Prioritize minimizing waste *and* consider bin fullness—avoiding both extremes improves packing density.
Combine exploitation (best fit) with controlled exploration (randomization) & consider item order impact.
Prioritize nuanced fit—sigmoid scales better than softmax's all-or-nothing approach; consider bin fullness.
Prioritize exact fits, balance exploration/exploitation, and ensure valid bin selection always.
Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space; simple, direct metrics often outperform complex normalizations.




Sharpen sigmoid, handle zero capacity, normalize fit scores, and consider item density.
Prioritize nearly-full bins; sigmoid fits can help, but simple reciprocals often suffice. Avoid zero-division!
Prioritize exact fits, then use smooth, scaled scores reflecting item-to-capacity ratios. Avoid zero-division.




Prioritize exact fits, then utilize inverse remaining capacity; avoid uniform scoring. Consider item density too.

Write constructive hints for designing better heuristics, based on prior reflections and new insights and using less than 50 words.

You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.
Your response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: "```python ... ```".

User Prompt: 
Write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.
The priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.


[Prior reflection]
## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:

Prioritize exact fits first. Then, score bins by inverse remaining capacity *and* item density – avoid zero-division! Use a sharpened sigmoid for nuanced fit, favoring nearly-full bins. Minimize waste; simple, direct metrics beat complex ones. Controlled exploration is key.





[Code]
def priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    return priorities

    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin using Best Fit strategy.
    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
    """
    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)
    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap >= item
    if not np.any(valid_bins):
        return priorities  # No bin can fit the item

    # Calculate the remaining capacity after placing the item
    remaining_after_placement = bins_remain_cap[valid_bins] - item

    # Best Fit: Minimize the remaining capacity (most filled bin)
    priorities[valid_bins] = -remaining_after_placement

    return priorities

[Improved code]
Please write a mutated function `priority_v2`, according to the reflection. Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.
