Simplicity & fill-ratio focus often win. Avoid complex combinations; prioritize maximizing bin utilization directly.




Prioritize exact fits, target fullness (around 70%), and balance exploration with exploitation.
Prioritize bins nearing fullness; randomness alone is weak. Consider item size relative to remaining bin capacity.




Combine exploitation (fit) with exploration; consider bin fullness & item size relationships. Weighting matters!
Prioritize exact fits, minimize waste, and consider adding dynamic randomization for exploration.
Consider item-bin fit *and* bin utilization; sigmoid scaling can refine priority distributions.

Prioritize tighter fits, but use smooth, scaled scores (like sigmoid) instead of simple reciprocals.
Prioritize tighter fits (sigmoid!), avoid division by zero, and simplify—less is often more.




Prioritize near-full bins; consider item size relative to remaining capacity—don't just minimize waste.
Prioritize fit *and* bin fullness; avoid zero distances; weight combinations effectively.
