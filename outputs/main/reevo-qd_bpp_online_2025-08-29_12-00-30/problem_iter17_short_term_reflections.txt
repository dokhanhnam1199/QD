Prioritize exact fits, then minimize wasted space; simple, direct scoring often outperforms complex functions.
Prioritize exact fits, bin fullness, and add controlled randomness for exploration & exploitation balance.
Prioritize exact fits, consider remaining capacity *and* item density for better packing.
Prioritize valid bins, normalize scores, and tune sigmoid sharpness for better fit evaluation.
Prioritize exact fits & minimal waste. Reward nearly-full bins; reduce reliance on randomness. Scale scores effectively.
Prioritize fit, fullness (around 70%), avoid empty bins, & add controlled randomness for exploration.
Prioritize exact fits, target fullness (around 70%), and balance exploration with exploitation.




Prioritize nearly-full bins; consider item size *relative* to remaining bin capacity—not just absolute values.
Prioritize minimizing waste & consider item-bin fit tightness—avoiding large remaining spaces.
Prioritize best-fit *and* bin fullness; avoid zero remainders & negative scores.
