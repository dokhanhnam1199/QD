Prioritize tighter fits & fuller bins; avoid empty bins; small bonuses/penalties help exploration.
Prioritize fit *and* fullness; avoid empty bins; consider a small bonus/penalty scheme.




Prioritize exact fits, bin fullness, and add exploration via randomness—balance exploitation & exploration.
Exploit bin fit (minimize waste) & avoid randomness; consider item characteristics too.
Prioritize non-linear scoring & consider bin validity; normalization and tunable parameters help refine bin selection.
Combine best-fit *and* fullness; penalize nearly-empty bins to promote consolidation.
Prioritize exact fits, consider bin fullness, and add exploration via randomness—balance exploitation & discovery.
Prioritize exact fits, target fullness (around 70%), and add small randomness for exploration.
Prioritize exact fits, use non-linear scoring, and consider item-bin interactions—not just individual features.




Prioritize exact fits, target fullness (around 70%), and add small randomness for exploration.
