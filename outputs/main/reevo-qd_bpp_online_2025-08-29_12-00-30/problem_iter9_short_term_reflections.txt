Prioritize informed choices (best-fit) & balance exploration (randomness) with dynamic adjustment—decaying epsilon helps!
Prioritize exact fits, consider bin fullness *and* item size/density for better packing.
Prioritize near-full bins, minimize waste, and add controlled randomness for exploration.
Prioritize both exact fits *and* exploit non-linear scoring (like sigmoid) to favor tighter packs.
Prioritize remaining capacity *and* tightest fit; logarithmic scaling helps balance these factors.




Combine exploitation (best fit) with exploration (randomness/bonuses); reward full/nearly-full bins proactively.
Prioritize fit *and* fullness, tune sigmoid scaling, and weight components carefully for optimal bin packing.




Simplicity & problem-specific knowledge often outperform complex, general heuristics like epsilon-greedy. Focus on item-bin *relationships*.




Focus on feasible solutions & minimizing waste; avoid softmax’s complexity for simple problems.

Prioritize fit *and* fullness; avoid empty bins; consider a small bonus/penalty scheme.
