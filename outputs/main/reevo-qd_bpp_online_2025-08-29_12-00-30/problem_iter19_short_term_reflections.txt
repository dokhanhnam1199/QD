Prioritize exact fits, target fullness (around 70%), and balance exploration with exploitation.
Focus on normalization, simplicity, and tunable parametersâ€”avoid excessive, potentially conflicting scoring components.
Prioritize fit *and* fullness, using normalization (like Softmax/Sigmoid) & weighted combinations for robust bin selection.




Prioritize non-linear scoring (sigmoid) & fit, not just remaining capacity; avoid simple inverses.
Prioritize tighter fits, use non-linear scoring (sigmoid), and explicitly handle full/invalid bins.
Combine exploitation (best fit, full bins) with exploration (randomness, item size) for robust online BPP heuristics.




Prioritize simplicity & exploit specific solutions (exact fits) before general heuristics. Avoid complex weighting.
Prioritize exact fits & lower density; avoid softmax's smoothing when precision matters.
Combine exploitation (best fit, full bins) with exploration (randomness, item-size aware bonuses) for robust online BPP heuristics.




Prioritize exact fits, consider bin density, and use logarithmic scaling for remaining capacity.
