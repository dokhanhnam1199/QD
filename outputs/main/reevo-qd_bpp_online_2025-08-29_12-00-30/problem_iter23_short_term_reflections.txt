Prioritize tighter fits, consider bin fullness, and add controlled randomness for exploration.
Prioritize exact fits, adjust target fullness, & scale exploration with item size.
Prioritize exact fits, balance fullness, and explore with item-size awareness for robust bin packing.
Prioritize item-aware exploration & tune weights based on problem instance characteristics.
Consider fit, bin usage, *and* anticipate future items—weighting matters for optimal online bin packing.
Prioritize exploitation (fit) & avoid division by zero; sigmoid scaling sharpens bin preference.
Prioritize simplicity & directness. Best-fit often outperforms complex combinations; focus on core principles.
Prioritize simplicity & smoothness; sigmoid fits often outperform complex, blended heuristics—focus on core fit.
Prioritize exact fits, leverage item density, and use shaped functions (like sigmoid) for nuanced bin evaluation.




Prioritize exact fits, target fullness (around 70%), and balance exploration with exploitation.
