## BPP Heuristic Design Hints:

Prioritize exact fits first. Then, score bins by inverse remaining capacity *and* item density â€“ avoid zero-division! Use a sharpened sigmoid for nuanced fit, favoring nearly-full bins. Minimize waste; simple, direct metrics beat complex ones. Controlled exploration is key.
