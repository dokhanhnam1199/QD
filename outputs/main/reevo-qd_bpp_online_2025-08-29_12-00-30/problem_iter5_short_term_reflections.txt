Prioritize exact/best fits heavily; simple, weighted remaining capacity often outperforms exploration.
Prioritize fit *and* bin fullness; avoid division by zero; consider bin utilization.
Prioritize valid bins, explore randomness strategically, and avoid assigning priority to invalid bins.
Prioritize minimizing wasted space; consider both fit *and* remaining capacity strategically.
Focus on bin fullness; prioritize minimizing remaining space—simplicity often outperforms complex exploration.




Prioritize critical matches (exact fit) & scale remaining space for better bin utilization.
Prioritize fit *and* fullness; avoid division by zero; consider inverse distance for better packing.




Prioritize informed choices (fit) & handle edge cases; smoothness (sigmoid) can improve exploration/exploitation.
Prioritize fit—consider item size *relative* to bin space; avoid zero distances. Explore weighted combinations of metrics.




Prioritize nuanced fit (sigmoid) over simple difference; avoid division by zero; scale impacts sensitivity.
