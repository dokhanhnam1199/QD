Prioritize fit quality *and* remaining space; avoid random exploration unless strategically beneficial.
Prioritize minimizing waste *and* consider bin fullness—avoiding both extremes improves packing density.
Combine exploitation (best fit) with controlled exploration (randomization) & consider item order impact.
Prioritize nuanced fit—sigmoid scales better than softmax's all-or-nothing approach; consider bin fullness.
Prioritize exact fits, balance exploration/exploitation, and ensure valid bin selection always.
Prioritize bins minimizing wasted space; simple, direct metrics often outperform complex normalizations.




Sharpen sigmoid, handle zero capacity, normalize fit scores, and consider item density.
Prioritize nearly-full bins; sigmoid fits can help, but simple reciprocals often suffice. Avoid zero-division!
Prioritize exact fits, then use smooth, scaled scores reflecting item-to-capacity ratios. Avoid zero-division.




Prioritize exact fits, then utilize inverse remaining capacity; avoid uniform scoring. Consider item density too.
