**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic uses a combination of waste minimization, fill level encouragement, bin utilization, and stability, with carefully chosen functions (exponential decay, sigmoid, tanh) and weights, while the 20th only considers a simple log ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows a similar pattern: the second heuristic incorporates waste, fill level, and balance, with an adaptive weight for waste vs. fill, whereas the second worst only uses a log ratio. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first uses stability scaled by item size and tanh, while the second focuses on adaptability with alpha and balance with gaussian distribution. (3rd) vs (4th) shows the third prioritizes waste minimization, fill level encouragement, and stability, using reciprocal, sigmoid, and linear functions, with conditional feasibility checks, whereas the fourth simply adds waste penalty and fill reward. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both compute and return the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity, indicating minimal feature engineering and consideration of multiple factors. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors with careful weighting and tailored functions (exponential, sigmoid, tanh), consider feasibility, and aim for a balance between waste minimization, fill level, bin utilization, and stability. They also often use scaling and clipping to avoid extreme values and division by zero. Worse heuristics tend to rely on simpler calculations (e.g., just ratio or log ratio), lack nuanced weighting, and don't account for feasibility or potential edge cases.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, prioritize incorporating multiple relevant factors, using appropriate mathematical functions to model their impact, and carefully tuning their weights. Always consider edge cases, feasibility constraints, and potential for extreme values, and use techniques like scaling and clipping to improve robustness.
