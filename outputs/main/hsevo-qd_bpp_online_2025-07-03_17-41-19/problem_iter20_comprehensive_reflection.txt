Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection":

*   **Keywords:** Relevant factors, mathematical modeling, weighting, edge cases, robustness, scaling, feasibility constraints.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize incorporating *all* truly relevant factors *directly* instead of approximating; use appropriate (but not necessarily complex or non-linear) mathematical models, and carefully tune weights. Ensure robustness.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on non-linear functions (exponential, sigmoid, etc.) *without strong justification*; Approximating missing data when direct incorporation is feasible; Premature optimization of parameters.

*   **Explanation:** Focus on a solid foundation. Accurately represent the problem's core elements mathematically, handle boundary conditions gracefully, and only add complexity *after* a simple, robust heuristic exists.
