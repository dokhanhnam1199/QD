Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function considers multiple factors:\n    1. Waste: Prioritizes bins where the item fits relatively well, minimizing wasted space.\n    2. Fill Level: Encourages filling bins as much as possible, but penalizes overfilling (impossible but included for completeness).\n    3. Number of Items: Accounts for how many items are already present in bins (not directly accessible in online BPP). We approximate using the amount of available space. Sparsely filled bins are encouraged, up to a point. Densely filled bins discouraged.\n    4. Stability: Favors bins that are closest to the item size.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to avoid division by zero and log of zero\n\n    # Waste: Prioritize bins where the item fits relatively well.\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    waste_penalty = np.where(waste >= 0, np.exp(-waste), -np.inf)  # Exponential decay for waste, harsh penalty for overfill.

Prioritize explainability by clearly articulating the rationale behind design choices. Incorporate adaptive parameters that respond to problem characteristics during runtime. Promote modularity to facilitate component replacement and refinement.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single evaluation metrics. Neglecting edge cases or unforeseen scenarios. Premature optimization without clear performance benchmarks.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection leads to designing heuristics that are not only performant but also robust, understandable, and easily adaptable to changing problem dynamics. Design your evaluation such that the performance is measurable and comparable to other heuristics.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
