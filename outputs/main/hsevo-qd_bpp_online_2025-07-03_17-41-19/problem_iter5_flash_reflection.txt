**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the first heuristic considers both waste minimization and fill level, while the last only considers a ratio.  (2nd best) vs (second worst) shows that more complex functions like exponential decay, sigmoid, tanh, and absolute difference are used for waste penalty, fill reward, bin utilization and stability, respectively. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the first heuristic is simpler, only combining waste penalty and fill reward, while the second incorporates bin utilization and stability, using more sophisticated mathematical functions. (3rd) vs (4th) shows that tunable parameters such as `waste_exp_scale`, `fill_exp_scale`, `item_density_scale`, and `stability_scale` allows for fine-grained adjustments. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see the simpler version uses a ratio and log of ratios. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors and use non-linear functions with scaling, while the worst use simple ratios. The better heuristics also allow for more parameters for tuning and refinement. There is some code duplication, in particular from 2nd to the 6th and from the 3rd to 7th, 9th, 10th.

**Experience:**
To design better heuristics, consider multiple factors, use non-linear functions to model relationships, incorporate tunable parameters for fine-grained control, and avoid code duplication. Prioritize a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.
