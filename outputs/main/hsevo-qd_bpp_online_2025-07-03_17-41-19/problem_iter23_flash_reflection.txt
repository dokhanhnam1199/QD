**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers waste, capacity, item size, and fill ratio, using exponentials and normalization for a nuanced priority score, while the worst only uses `item/bin_remain_cap` and `np.log`, without considering if the item fits. (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) is the same as (1st) vs (20th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the functions are identical, indicating potential redundancy or a need for further differentiation. (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic 3 adds small capacity threshold (with severe penalty) which leads to better performance. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they all similarly use `item / bins_remain_cap` and `np.log`, which is oversimplified. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors with carefully chosen weighting and normalization, while the worst rely on simple ratios, leading to suboptimal bin packing. Adding carefully considered factors improves results.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, normalize them appropriately, and assign weights based on their importance.  Use techniques like exponentials or sigmoid functions to fine-tune the influence of each factor. Always check item feasibility before assigning priorities.
