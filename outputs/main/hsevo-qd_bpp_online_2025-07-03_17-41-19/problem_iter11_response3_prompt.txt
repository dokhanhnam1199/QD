Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines waste minimization and fill level to improve priority.\"\"\"\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = 1e-9\n\n    # Waste minimization: Smaller waste is better\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    waste_penalty = np.where(waste >= 0, -waste, -np.inf)\n    priorities += waste_penalty\n\n    # Fill level: Encourages fuller bins\n    fill_ratio = item / (bins_remain_cap + epsilon)\n    fill_reward = np.where(fill_ratio <= 1, fill_ratio, -np.inf)\n    priorities += fill_reward\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    ratios = item / bins_remain_cap\n    log_ratios = np.log(ratios)\n    priorities = -log_ratios\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of waste minimization and a modified fill ratio, while the worst only considers the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic incorporates waste, fill level, item density approximation, and stability, while the nineteenth-ranked heuristic only considers the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic has a simpler calculation for waste minimization and fill level, while the second best uses exponential decays and approximates item density. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third-ranked heuristic includes waste, fill level, item density approximation, and stability, while the fourth only considers waste minimization and fill level. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are exactly same. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors, like waste minimization, fill level, item density, and stability, often using exponential functions, sigmoid or tanh to balance these factors. They often normalize by item sizes or other relevant parameters to make the scores more comparable. The worst ones only cares about log ratios and has not many tuning.\n- \nOkay, I understand. Let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to be more effective for heuristic design. Here's a redefinition, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Problem understanding, Factor identification, Relationship modeling, Parameter tuning, Performance validation, Iterative refinement.\n*   **Advice:** Deeply understand the problem. Systematically identify relevant factors. Explore function families based on problem structure. Use parameter tuning for control. Validate using diverse datasets.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, Over-reliance on specific functions without justification, Ignoring computational cost, Neglecting documentation.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection requires understanding *why* a heuristic works or fails. It's a cycle of hypothesis, implementation, and rigorous testing to refine your understanding of the problem and model it effectively.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
