Your task is to design heuristics that can effectively solve optimization problems.\nYour response outputs Python code and nothing else. Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function refines the bin selection process by:\n    1.  Best Fit Emphasis: Strongly prioritizes bins where the item fits with minimal waste. This is the core principle of Best-Fit heuristics.\n    2.  Remaining Capacity Consideration: Balances the \"Best Fit\" with a preference for bins that still have substantial capacity, avoiding premature fragmentation.\n    3.  Item Size Normalization: Normalize the item size to better reflect its significance relative to bin capacity.\n    4.  Capacity Threshold: Introduces a threshold for considering bins. Bins with very small remaining capacity relative to item size are heavily penalized.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to avoid division by zero\n\n    # 1. Best Fit Emphasis: Minimize waste\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    # Only consider bins where the item fits\n    fit_mask = waste >= 0\n    priorities = np.where(fit_mask, np.exp(-waste / (item + epsilon)), -np.inf)  # Normalized waste for better comparison. Exp to prioritize smaller waste.\n    # 2. Remaining Capacity Consideration: Balance best fit with available space.\n    # Prioritize bins with more remaining capacity (avoid excessive fragmentation)\n    capacity_factor = bins_remain_cap / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + epsilon)  # Normalize remaining capacity\n    priorities = np.where(fit_mask, priorities + 0.5 * capacity_factor, priorities)  # Add capacity as a secondary factor. Multiply by 0.5 so it doesn't override best-fit.\n\n    # 3. Item Size Normalization\n    normalized_item_size = item / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + epsilon) # normalize to largest bin to give it context.\n    priorities = np.where(fit_mask, priorities + 0.1 * (1 - normalized_item_size), priorities)\n\n    # 4. Capacity Threshold: Penalize bins that are almost full\n    threshold = 0.1  # If remaining capacity is less than 10% of bin size, penalize.\n    small_capacity_penalty = np.where(bins_remain_cap / (np.max(bins_remain_cap) + epsilon) < threshold, -10, 0) #severe penalty\n    priorities += small_capacity_penalty\n\n    return priorities\n\n### Worse code\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    ratios = item / bins_remain_cap\n    log_ratios = np.log(ratios)\n    priorities = -log_ratios\n    return priorities\n\n### Analyze & experience\n- Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic considers several factors like best-fit, capacity, item size normalization, and fill ratio, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity and its logarithm. (2nd best) vs (19th) gives similar insights.\n\nComparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical. This suggests either they perform similarly, or the ranking is based on other factors not evident in the code itself.\n\n(3rd) vs (4th): The 3rd heuristic refines the weighting and introduces a bonus for bins with significantly larger capacity than the item, while the 4th heuristic introduces a capacity threshold that penalizes bins that are almost full. The 3rd uses `np.sqrt` to soften the effect of the capacity factor, and `np.exp(-np.abs(1 - fill_ratio))` to reduce the penalty for near-full bins.\n\nComparing (second worst) vs (worst), both use a simple ratio, but the worst uses a direct ratio calculation followed by a logarithm while the second-worst also calculates the log of ratios.\n\nOverall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors with carefully tuned weights and potentially non-linear transformations (e.g., exponentials, sigmoid) to better shape the priority landscape. They also exhibit an understanding of edge cases, such as avoiding near-empty or near-full bins through penalties or rewards. They normalize values to give context and allow for better comparison.\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of \"Ineffective self-reflection,\" and aiming for actionable advice.\n\n**Redefined \"Current Self-Reflection\":**\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, normalization, weighting, edge-case handling, domain knowledge, rewards/penalties, scaling, clipping, constraints, feasibility.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize identifying *truly* relevant factors. Design mathematical functions that realistically model factor relationships and enforce constraints. Consider both positive (rewards) and negative (penalties) impacts, and implement scaling/clipping to maintain robustness.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, generic non-linear functions (e.g., *just* using exponentials/sigmoids without justification). Premature optimization.\n\n*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create heuristics based on a clear understanding of the problem. Keep it simple initially and build up complexity *only* as needed. Avoid using advanced math functions without a strong rationale tied to the problem domain.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
