Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function refines the bin selection process by:\n    1.  Best Fit Emphasis: Strongly prioritizes bins where the item fits with minimal waste. This is the core principle of Best-Fit heuristics.\n    2.  Remaining Capacity Consideration: Balances the \"Best Fit\" with a preference for bins that still have substantial capacity, avoiding premature fragmentation.\n    3.  Item Size Normalization: Normalize the item size to better reflect its significance relative to bin capacity.\n    4.  Capacity Threshold: Introduces a threshold for considering bins. Bins with very small remaining capacity relative to item size are heavily penalized.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to avoid division by zero\n\n    # 1.

Waste: Prioritizes bins where the item fits relatively well, minimizing wasted space.\n    2. Fill Level: Encourages filling bins as much as possible, but penalizes overfilling (impossible but included for completeness).\n    3. Number of Items: Accounts for how many items are already present in bins (not directly accessible in online BPP). We approximate using the amount of available space. Sparsely filled bins are encouraged, up to a point. Densely filled bins discouraged.\n    4. Stability: Favors bins that are closest to the item size.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        waste_exp_scale: Scaling factor for the waste exponential.\n        fill_exp_scale: Scaling factor for the fill exponential.\n        density_exp_scale: Scaling factor for the density exponential.\n        stability_weight: Weight of the stability component.\n        epsilon: Small value to avoid division by zero and log of zero\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n\n    # Waste: Prioritize bins where the item fits relatively well.\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    waste_penalty = np.where(waste >= 0, np.exp(-waste * waste_exp_scale), -np.inf)  # Exponential decay for waste, harsh penalty for overfill.

(2nd best) vs (2nd worst) is the same as (1st) vs (20th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the functions are identical, indicating potential redundancy or a need for further differentiation. (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic 3 adds small capacity threshold (with severe penalty) which leads to better performance. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they all similarly use `item / bins_remain_cap` and `np.log`, which is oversimplified. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors with carefully chosen weighting and normalization, while the worst rely on simple ratios, leading to suboptimal bin packing. Adding carefully considered factors improves results.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for heuristic design, aiming to avoid pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** **Factor Relevance, Principled Combination, Robustness, Validation.**\n*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* factors are relevant and *how* they interact fundamentally. Justify function choices based on problem structure, not just trial and error.\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly applying non-linear functions without clear justification. Over-tuning parameters without understanding their impact. Neglecting thorough testing and validation against diverse scenarios.\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply combining factors and using functions, deeply analyze their relationships. Validate assumptions and ensure robustness beyond training data.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
