Okay, here's a refined take on self-reflection for heuristic design, steering clear of vague pronouncements:

*   **Keywords:** Heuristic evaluation, cognitive biases, performance metrics, solution space analysis.
*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic performance across diverse problem instances. Quantify the impact of design choices and identify edge cases where the heuristic falters.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on intuition. Neglecting rigorous testing and performance measurement.
*   **Explanation:** Use data to understand *why* a heuristic works (or doesn't). Analyze its behavior relative to optimal solutions or other heuristics using appropriate metrics.
