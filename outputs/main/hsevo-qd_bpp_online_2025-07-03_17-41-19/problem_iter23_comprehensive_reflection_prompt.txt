{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, normalize them appropriately, and assign weights based on their importance.  Use techniques like exponentials or sigmoid functions to fine-tune the influence of each factor. Always check item feasibility before assigning priorities.\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize incorporating multiple relevant factors, using appropriate mathematical functions to model their impact, and carefully tuning their weights. Always consider edge cases, feasibility constraints, and potential for extreme values, and use techniques like scaling and clipping to improve robustness.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, normalize inputs to a common scale, use carefully chosen weighting, avoid edge-case penalties (e.g., division by zero), incorporate domain knowledge, and consider both rewards and penalties.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using non-linear functions like exponentials to capture nuanced relationships and trade-offs. Approximating unavailable information with available data can also improve performance.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider multiple factors, use non-linear functions to model relationships, incorporate tunable parameters for fine-grained control, and avoid code duplication. Prioritize a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with appropriate weighting and scaling. Experiment with non-linear functions like exponentials, sigmoid, and tanh to capture nuanced relationships. Document the reasoning and purpose of each component. Include tunable parameters for future optimization.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Experiment with different mathematical functions (e.g., exponential, sigmoid, tanh) to balance the influence of each factor and scale those factors appropriately. Normalizing by relevant parameters can improve heuristic performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interactions. Use appropriate functions (e.g., exponential, sigmoid) to model rewards and penalties. Include mechanisms for balancing different objectives and introduce tunable parameters for adaptability. Start simple and iteratively add complexity.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
