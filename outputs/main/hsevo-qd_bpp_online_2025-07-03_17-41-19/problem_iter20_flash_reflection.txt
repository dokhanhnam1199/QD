**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic considers waste, remaining capacity, item size normalization, and capacity threshold, using carefully weighted combinations and normalization techniques. In contrast, the bottom heuristic uses a simple log ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (1st) vs (4th), the top heuristic uses a more sophisticated combination of waste minimization, remaining capacity and item size normalization with capacity threshold, while the (4th) heuristic combines waste minimization and fill level considerations with less nuanced penalties and rewards. (5th) considers waste, fill level, item fit, bin utilization, and number of items (approximated by remaining space). (6th) considers waste minimization and a modified fill ratio. (7th) considers waste, fill level, bin utilization, best fit heuristic influence, and avoidance of near-empty bins. (8th) considers waste, fill level, number of items, and stability and uses scaling factors. Comparing (8th) vs (9th), (8th) has scaling factors as parameters and (9th) doesn't. Comparing (7th) vs (10th), they are identical. Comparing (11th) vs (15th), (11th) considers waste minimization, fill level encouragement and stability, while (15th) is a simplified one. Comparing (13th) vs (14th), they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors with careful weighting and normalization, and avoid edge-case penalties.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, normalize inputs to a common scale, use carefully chosen weighting, avoid edge-case penalties (e.g., division by zero), incorporate domain knowledge, and consider both rewards and penalties.
