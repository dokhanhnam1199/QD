**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of waste minimization and a modified fill ratio, while the worst only considers the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best heuristic incorporates waste, fill level, item density approximation, and stability, while the nineteenth-ranked heuristic only considers the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic has a simpler calculation for waste minimization and fill level, while the second best uses exponential decays and approximates item density. Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the third-ranked heuristic includes waste, fill level, item density approximation, and stability, while the fourth only considers waste minimization and fill level. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are exactly same. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors, like waste minimization, fill level, item density, and stability, often using exponential functions, sigmoid or tanh to balance these factors. They often normalize by item sizes or other relevant parameters to make the scores more comparable. The worst ones only cares about log ratios and has not many tuning.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Experiment with different mathematical functions (e.g., exponential, sigmoid, tanh) to balance the influence of each factor and scale those factors appropriately. Normalizing by relevant parameters can improve heuristic performance.
