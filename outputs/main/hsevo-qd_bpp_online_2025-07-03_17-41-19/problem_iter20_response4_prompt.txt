Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function considers multiple factors:\n    1. Waste: Prioritizes bins where the item fits relatively well, minimizing wasted space.\n    2.

Number of Items: Accounts for how many items are already present in bins (not directly accessible in online BPP). We approximate using the amount of available space.

In contrast, the bottom heuristic uses a simple log ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd) is identical to (1st). Comparing (1st) vs (4th), the top heuristic uses a more sophisticated combination of waste minimization, remaining capacity and item size normalization with capacity threshold, while the (4th) heuristic combines waste minimization and fill level considerations with less nuanced penalties and rewards. (5th) considers waste, fill level, item fit, bin utilization, and number of items (approximated by remaining space). (6th) considers waste minimization and a modified fill ratio. (7th) considers waste, fill level, bin utilization, best fit heuristic influence, and avoidance of near-empty bins. (8th) considers waste, fill level, number of items, and stability and uses scaling factors. Comparing (8th) vs (9th), (8th) has scaling factors as parameters and (9th) doesn't. Comparing (7th) vs (10th), they are identical. Comparing (11th) vs (15th), (11th) considers waste minimization, fill level encouragement and stability, while (15th) is a simplified one. Comparing (13th) vs (14th), they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors with careful weighting and normalization, and avoid edge-case penalties.\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current Self-Reflection\" for designing better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls of \"Ineffective Self-Reflection\":\n\n*   **Keywords:** Relevant factors, mathematical modeling, weighting, edge cases, robustness, scaling, feasibility constraints.\n\n*   **Advice:** Prioritize incorporating *all* truly relevant factors *directly* instead of approximating; use appropriate (but not necessarily complex or non-linear) mathematical models, and carefully tune weights. Ensure robustness.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on non-linear functions (exponential, sigmoid, etc.) *without strong justification*; Approximating missing data when direct incorporation is feasible; Premature optimization of parameters.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Focus on a solid foundation. Accurately represent the problem's core elements mathematically, handle boundary conditions gracefully, and only add complexity *after* a simple, robust heuristic exists.\n\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
