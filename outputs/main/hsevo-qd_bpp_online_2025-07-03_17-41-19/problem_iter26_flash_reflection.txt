**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the best heuristic considers several factors like best-fit, capacity, item size normalization, and fill ratio, while the worst only considers the ratio of item size to remaining capacity and its logarithm. (2nd best) vs (19th) gives similar insights.

Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), they are identical. This suggests either they perform similarly, or the ranking is based on other factors not evident in the code itself.

(3rd) vs (4th): The 3rd heuristic refines the weighting and introduces a bonus for bins with significantly larger capacity than the item, while the 4th heuristic introduces a capacity threshold that penalizes bins that are almost full. The 3rd uses `np.sqrt` to soften the effect of the capacity factor, and `np.exp(-np.abs(1 - fill_ratio))` to reduce the penalty for near-full bins.

Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both use a simple ratio, but the worst uses a direct ratio calculation followed by a logarithm while the second-worst also calculates the log of ratios.

Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors with carefully tuned weights and potentially non-linear transformations (e.g., exponentials, sigmoid) to better shape the priority landscape. They also exhibit an understanding of edge cases, such as avoiding near-empty or near-full bins through penalties or rewards. They normalize values to give context and allow for better comparison.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple relevant factors, normalize inputs, use non-linear transformations for fine-grained control, and address potential edge cases. Experiment with different weighting schemes to balance the importance of each factor and consider adaptive parameters.
