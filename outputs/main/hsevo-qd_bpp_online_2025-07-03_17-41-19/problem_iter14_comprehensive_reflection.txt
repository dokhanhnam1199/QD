Okay, here's a redefinition of "Current Self-Reflection" focused on designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls identified in "Ineffective Self-Reflection," and offering actionable advice:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem-specific adaptation, transparent rationale, validation.
*   **Advice:** Begin with a minimal, interpretable heuristic. Systematically add complexity *only* when justified by data. Continuously validate the heuristic's performance on relevant problem instances. Document the *why* behind each design choice.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, blindly applying non-linear functions without justification, introducing parameters without a clear purpose, neglecting computational cost.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on building understanding first. Don't over-engineer. Understand each element's contribution before adding more. Verification is key.
