**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the top heuristic considers waste, fill level, estimated number of items, and stability, using exponential and absolute value functions to create a nuanced priority score. The worst heuristic only uses the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity.
Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the same trend holds, the better heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach incorporating waste, fill level, item density approximation, and stability, while the worse uses only a ratio-based logarithmic calculation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), and (3rd) vs (4th), there are no differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there are also no differences. Overall: The better heuristics use more factors, including waste, fill level, stability and approximations of number of items in the bins. They also use a combination of exponential functions, absolute values, and negative infinity to provide greater nuance in the priority scores. The worst ones are just one simple calculation, using log ratios.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using non-linear functions like exponentials to capture nuanced relationships and trade-offs. Approximating unavailable information with available data can also improve performance.
