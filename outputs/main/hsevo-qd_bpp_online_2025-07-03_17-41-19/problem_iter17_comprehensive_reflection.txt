Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to build better heuristics, while actively avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Problem Understanding, Factor Relevance, Empirical Validation, Adaptive Refinement.

*   **Advice:** Start with a deep understanding of the problem. Prioritize identifying truly *relevant* factors, not just many factors. Focus on rigorous *empirical validation* to assess performance. Emphasize an iterative process of adaptive refinement based on experimental results.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly using complex, non-linear functions *before* understanding factor relationships. Over-reliance on tunable parameters without a clear validation strategy. Over-engineering early in the process.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics stem from understanding the problem and validating ideas with data, not just blindly applying complexity. Validation guides refinement.
