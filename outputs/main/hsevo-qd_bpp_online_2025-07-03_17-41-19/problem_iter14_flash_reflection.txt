**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers waste, fill level, bin utilization, best fit, and avoidance of near-empty bins, using specific penalties and rewards. The worst heuristic only calculates the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.
Comparing (2nd) vs (19th), the second-best incorporates waste, fill level, number of items (approximated), and stability, using scaling factors for each. The 19th heuristic only considers the negative log of the ratio of item size to remaining bin capacity.
Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the 1st heuristic uses hardcoded weights and specific conditions for bonuses/penalties, while the 2nd heuristic uses scaling factors that can be tuned.
Comparing (3rd) vs (4th), the 3rd heuristic combines waste minimization and a modified fill ratio, while the 4th adds a balance factor and an adaptability parameter (alpha).
Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both calculate the same priorities; they are identical.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate multiple factors like waste, fill level, bin utilization, and stability, often using exponential or sigmoid functions to model the rewards and penalties. They also include mechanisms for balancing bin utilization and avoiding edge cases. The worse heuristics are simplistic, considering only the ratio of item size to remaining capacity, which is insufficient for effective bin packing. Tunable parameters (like `alpha` or scaling factors) appear in the better heuristics, which provides more flexibility to adapt for different problem instances.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interactions. Use appropriate functions (e.g., exponential, sigmoid) to model rewards and penalties. Include mechanisms for balancing different objectives and introduce tunable parameters for adaptability. Start simple and iteratively add complexity.
