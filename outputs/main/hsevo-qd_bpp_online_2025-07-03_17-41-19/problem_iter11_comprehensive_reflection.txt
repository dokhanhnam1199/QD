Okay, I understand. Let's refine "Current self-reflection" to be more effective for heuristic design. Here's a redefinition, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Problem understanding, Factor identification, Relationship modeling, Parameter tuning, Performance validation, Iterative refinement.
*   **Advice:** Deeply understand the problem. Systematically identify relevant factors. Explore function families based on problem structure. Use parameter tuning for control. Validate using diverse datasets.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, Over-reliance on specific functions without justification, Ignoring computational cost, Neglecting documentation.
*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection requires understanding *why* a heuristic works or fails. It's a cycle of hypothesis, implementation, and rigorous testing to refine your understanding of the problem and model it effectively.
