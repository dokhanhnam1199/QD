**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic considers both waste minimization and fill level, while the worst only considers a simple ratio. (2nd best) vs (second worst), heuristic 2nd incorporates waste, fill level, bin utilization and stability. (3rd) vs (4th), both utilize waste, fill level, item density and stability, but they use different scaling factors and weights. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), the best heuristic uses simpler linear combinations of waste and fill level, while the second best employs exponential decay, sigmoid functions, and tanh for more nuanced behavior. (3rd) vs (4th), they use exponential decay for waste, fill and density, and scaled stability with small different parameters. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), both are identical. Overall: Better heuristics incorporate multiple factors, often with non-linear scaling or weighting, and are well-documented. Simpler heuristics focusing on a single ratio tend to perform worse. Including bin utilization and stability generally improves performance. Tunable parameters offer further refinement.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with appropriate weighting and scaling. Experiment with non-linear functions like exponentials, sigmoid, and tanh to capture nuanced relationships. Document the reasoning and purpose of each component. Include tunable parameters for future optimization.
