    """Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.

    This priority function considers multiple factors:
    1. Waste: Prioritizes bins where the item fits relatively well, minimizing wasted space.
    2. Fill Level: Encourages filling bins as much as possible, but penalizes overfilling (impossible but included for completeness).
    3. Number of Items: Accounts for how many items are already present in bins (not directly accessible in online BPP). We approximate using the amount of available space. Sparsely filled bins are encouraged, up to a point. Densely filled bins discouraged.
    4. Stability: Favors bins that are closest to the item size.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
