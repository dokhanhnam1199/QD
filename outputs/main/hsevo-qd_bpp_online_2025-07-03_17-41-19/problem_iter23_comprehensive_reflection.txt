Okay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for heuristic design, aiming to avoid pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** **Factor Relevance, Principled Combination, Robustness, Validation.**
*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* factors are relevant and *how* they interact fundamentally. Justify function choices based on problem structure, not just trial and error.
*   **Avoid:** Blindly applying non-linear functions without clear justification. Over-tuning parameters without understanding their impact. Neglecting thorough testing and validation against diverse scenarios.
*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply combining factors and using functions, deeply analyze their relationships. Validate assumptions and ensure robustness beyond training data.
