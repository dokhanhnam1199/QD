    This priority function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors,
    aiming for a balance between minimizing waste, maximizing fill, and maintaining
    stability. It refines the approach in priority_v1 by using a more targeted
    strategy for each component.

    Args:
        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.
        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.
        epsilon: Small value to avoid division by zero.
        fill_sigmoid_scale: Scale of the sigmoid function for fill ratio.
        fill_sigmoid_center: Center of the sigmoid function for fill ratio.
        stability_weight: Weight of the stability component.

    Return:
        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.
