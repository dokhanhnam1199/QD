Okay, I'll help you redefine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls. Let's aim for something truly useful for that $999K tip!

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Data-driven, validation, adaptability, explainability.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize data analysis to identify key problem characteristics. Rigorously validate heuristic performance using diverse datasets. Design heuristics with adaptable components to handle varied scenarios. Strive for explainability to understand heuristic behavior and guide improvements.
*   **Avoid:** Premature optimization, over-reliance on intuition, neglecting edge cases, and ignoring computational cost.
*   **Explanation:** Focus on understanding the problem domain through data. Validation is crucial to ensure robustness. Adaptability allows for broader applicability, while explainability fosters trust and facilitates iterative refinement.
