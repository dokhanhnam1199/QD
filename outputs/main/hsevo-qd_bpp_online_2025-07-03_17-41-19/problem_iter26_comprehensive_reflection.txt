Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" for designing better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection," and aiming for actionable advice.

**Redefined "Current Self-Reflection":**

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, normalization, weighting, edge-case handling, domain knowledge, rewards/penalties, scaling, clipping, constraints, feasibility.

*   **Advice:** Prioritize identifying *truly* relevant factors. Design mathematical functions that realistically model factor relationships and enforce constraints. Consider both positive (rewards) and negative (penalties) impacts, and implement scaling/clipping to maintain robustness.

*   **Avoid:** Overly complex, generic non-linear functions (e.g., *just* using exponentials/sigmoids without justification). Premature optimization.

*   **Explanation:** The goal is to create heuristics based on a clear understanding of the problem. Keep it simple initially and build up complexity *only* as needed. Avoid using advanced math functions without a strong rationale tied to the problem domain.
