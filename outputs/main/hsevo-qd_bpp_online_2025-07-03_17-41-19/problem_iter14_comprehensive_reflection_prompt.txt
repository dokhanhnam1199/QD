{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors and their interactions. Use appropriate functions (e.g., exponential, sigmoid) to model rewards and penalties. Include mechanisms for balancing different objectives and introduce tunable parameters for adaptability. Start simple and iteratively add complexity.\nNone\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using non-linear functions like exponentials to capture nuanced relationships and trade-offs. Approximating unavailable information with available data can also improve performance.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider multiple factors, use non-linear functions to model relationships, incorporate tunable parameters for fine-grained control, and avoid code duplication. Prioritize a balance between model complexity and computational efficiency.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with appropriate weighting and scaling. Experiment with non-linear functions like exponentials, sigmoid, and tanh to capture nuanced relationships. Document the reasoning and purpose of each component. Include tunable parameters for future optimization.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider multiple factors relevant to the problem domain. Experiment with different mathematical functions (e.g., exponential, sigmoid, tanh) to balance the influence of each factor and scale those factors appropriately. Normalizing by relevant parameters can improve heuristic performance.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
