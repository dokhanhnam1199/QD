Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n                fill_sigmoid_scale: float = 9.493317672830546, fill_sigmoid_center: float = 0.7654453973055002,\n                stability_weight: float = 0.05972327746087532) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function prioritizes bins based on a combination of factors,\n    aiming for a balance between minimizing waste, maximizing fill, and maintaining\n    stability. It refines the approach in priority_v1 by using a more targeted\n    strategy for each component.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n        waste_clip_min: Small value to avoid division by zero when calculating waste priority.\n        fill_sigmoid_scale: Scale of the sigmoid function used for fill priority.\n        fill_sigmoid_center: Center point of the sigmoid function.\n        stability_weight: Weight of the stability component in the overall priority.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = waste_clip_min  # Small value to avoid division by zero\n\n    # 1.

(2nd best) vs (2nd worst) is the same as (1st) vs (20th). Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the functions are identical, indicating potential redundancy or a need for further differentiation. (3rd) vs (4th), heuristic 3 adds small capacity threshold (with severe penalty) which leads to better performance. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they all similarly use `item / bins_remain_cap` and `np.log`, which is oversimplified. Overall: The best heuristics incorporate multiple factors with carefully chosen weighting and normalization, while the worst rely on simple ratios, leading to suboptimal bin packing. Adding carefully considered factors improves results.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined perspective on self-reflection for heuristic design, aiming to avoid pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** **Factor Relevance, Principled Combination, Robustness, Validation.**\n*   **Advice:** Focus on *why* factors are relevant and *how* they interact fundamentally. Justify function choices based on problem structure, not just trial and error.\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly applying non-linear functions without clear justification. Over-tuning parameters without understanding their impact. Neglecting thorough testing and validation against diverse scenarios.\n*   **Explanation:** Instead of simply combining factors and using functions, deeply analyze their relationships. Validate assumptions and ensure robustness beyond training data.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
