Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to make it more effective for designing heuristics and avoid the pitfalls of "Ineffective self-reflection." Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Rigorous evaluation, explainability, adaptive parameters, modular design.

*   **Advice:** Focus on rigorous evaluation of heuristic performance across diverse problem instances. Prioritize explainability by clearly articulating the rationale behind design choices. Incorporate adaptive parameters that respond to problem characteristics during runtime. Promote modularity to facilitate component replacement and refinement.

*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single evaluation metrics. Neglecting edge cases or unforeseen scenarios. Premature optimization without clear performance benchmarks.

*   **Explanation:** Effective self-reflection leads to designing heuristics that are not only performant but also robust, understandable, and easily adaptable to changing problem dynamics. Design your evaluation such that the performance is measurable and comparable to other heuristics.
