Format your code as a Python code string: \"```python ... ```\".\n", "user": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\n### Better code\ndef priority_v0(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n\n    This priority function considers multiple factors:\n    1. Waste: Prioritizes bins where the item fits relatively well, minimizing wasted space.\n    2. Fill Level: Encourages filling bins as much as possible, but penalizes overfilling (impossible but included for completeness).\n    3. Number of Items: Accounts for how many items are already present in bins (not directly accessible in online BPP). We approximate using the amount of available space. Sparsely filled bins are encouraged, up to a point. Densely filled bins discouraged.\n    4. Stability: Favors bins that are closest to the item size.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    priorities = np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap, dtype=float)\n    epsilon = 1e-9  # Small value to avoid division by zero and log of zero\n\n    # Waste: Prioritize bins where the item fits relatively well.\n    waste = bins_remain_cap - item\n    waste_penalty = np.where(waste >= 0, np.exp(-waste), -np.inf)  # Exponential decay for waste, harsh penalty for overfill.

The worst heuristic only uses the log of the ratio of item size to remaining capacity.\nComparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), the same trend holds, the better heuristic uses a multi-faceted approach incorporating waste, fill level, item density approximation, and stability, while the worse uses only a ratio-based logarithmic calculation. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), and (3rd) vs (4th), there are no differences. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), there are also no differences. Overall: The better heuristics use more factors, including waste, fill level, stability and approximations of number of items in the bins. They also use a combination of exponential functions, absolute values, and negative infinity to provide greater nuance in the priority scores. The worst ones are just one simple calculation, using log ratios.\n- \nOkay, here's a refined take on self-reflection for heuristic design, steering clear of vague pronouncements:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Heuristic evaluation, cognitive biases, performance metrics, solution space analysis.\n*   **Advice:** Systematically analyze heuristic performance across diverse problem instances. Quantify the impact of design choices and identify edge cases where the heuristic falters.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on intuition. Neglecting rigorous testing and performance measurement.\n*   **Explanation:** Use data to understand *why* a heuristic works (or doesn't). Analyze its behavior relative to optimal solutions or other heuristics using appropriate metrics.\n\n\nYour task is to write an improved function `priority_v2` by COMBINING elements of two above heuristics base Analyze & experience.\nOutput the code within a Python code block: ```python ... ```, has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.\n\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
