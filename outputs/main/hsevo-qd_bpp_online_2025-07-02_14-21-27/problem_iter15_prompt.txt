Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines Newtonian potential and capacity ratio with adaptive weighting.\"\"\"\n\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    safe_bins_remain_cap = np.where(valid_bins, bins_remain_cap, np.inf)\n\n    # Newtonian component (Focuses on bins close to the item size)\n    potential = safe_bins_remain_cap / np.abs(safe_bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)\n    newtonian_priority = np.where(safe_bins_remain_cap >= item, potential, -np.inf)\n\n    # Capacity ratio component (Prioritizes bins that have space relative to item)\n    capacity_ratio = np.clip(safe_bins_remain_cap / (item + 1e-9), 0.001, 1000)\n    ratio_priority = np.log(capacity_ratio)\n\n    # Adaptive weighting based on item size relative to *available* capacity\n    weight = np.clip(item / (np.mean(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]) + 1e-9), 0.0, 1.0)\n\n    # Combine the priorities with adaptive weighting\n    combined_priority = weight * newtonian_priority + (1 - weight) * ratio_priority\n\n    combined_priority = np.nan_to_num(combined_priority, neginf=-np.inf)\n    priorities = np.where(~valid_bins, -np.inf, combined_priority)\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current self-reflection\" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection.\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, Adaptive Weights, Error Handling, Stochastic Exploration, Edge Cases, Robustness, Nuance.\n\n*   **Advice:** Systematically combine relevant factors, dynamically adjust weights based on performance, implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification (single-factor heuristics), relying solely on computationally cheap solutions, neglecting testing and validation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a balanced approach that considers multiple perspectives, learns from past performance through adaptive weighting, and anticipates potential failures with robust error handling. Stochastic exploration is necessary to escape local optima.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
