{"system": "You are an expert in the domain of optimization heuristics. Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors and use adaptive weights to adjust their influence based on context. Always handle edge cases and numerical stability issues. Avoid simple, single-factor heuristics. Ensure thorough testing to eliminate redundant or poorly performing heuristics.\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize nuanced approaches that consider multiple factors and edge cases. A simple solution may be computationally efficient, but often sacrifices accuracy and robustness. Consider inspiration from other fields like physics to create advanced heuristics.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights. Implement comprehensive safety checks and mechanisms to avoid local optima. Start with complete code. More sophisticated calculation are better.\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nNone\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let's think step by step."}
