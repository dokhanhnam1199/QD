Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, avoiding the pitfalls of "Ineffective Self-Reflection."

Here's a refined approach:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, multi-faceted, robust, contextual, iterative.
*   **Advice:** Develop heuristics that dynamically adapt based on context and incorporate multiple relevant factors. Prioritize robustness, especially against edge cases.
*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, premature optimization, neglecting edge cases, lack of validation.
*   **Explanation:** Design should be iterative: Begin with a foundational approach, rigorously test, and iteratively refine, focusing on adaptive mechanisms and addressing weaknesses revealed through testing.
