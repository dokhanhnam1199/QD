Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" for designing better heuristics, focusing on actionable improvements and avoiding common pitfalls. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weighting, Exploration, Robustness, Multi-factor, Error handling, Context awareness, Iterative testing.
*   **Advice:** Prioritize creating multi-faceted heuristics with adaptive weighting, robust error handling, and mechanisms for exploration to escape local optima.
*   **Avoid:** Over-simplification, relying on single-factor heuristics, neglecting edge cases, and insufficient testing of heuristic components.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance complexity and computational cost. Combining multiple factors with adaptive weights allows the heuristic to adapt to different problem instances. Exploration mechanisms (e.g., randomness) prevent stagnation. Robust error handling is crucial for real-world applications. Iterative testing and refinement ensure the chosen heuristic components contribute positively to the overall performance.
