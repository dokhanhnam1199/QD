Okay, let's redefine "Current self-reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding common pitfalls of ineffective self-reflection.
Here's a revised approach:

*   **Keywords:** Multi-factor, Adaptive Weights, Error Handling, Stochastic Exploration, Edge Cases, Robustness, Nuance.

*   **Advice:** Systematically combine relevant factors, dynamically adjust weights based on performance, implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases, and introduce controlled randomness for exploration.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification (single-factor heuristics), relying solely on computationally cheap solutions, neglecting testing and validation.

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristic design requires a balanced approach that considers multiple perspectives, learns from past performance through adaptive weighting, and anticipates potential failures with robust error handling. Stochastic exploration is necessary to escape local optima.
