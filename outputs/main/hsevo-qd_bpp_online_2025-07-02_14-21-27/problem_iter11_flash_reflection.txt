**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see that the first heuristic combines Newtonian potential and ratio-based approaches with adaptive weighting, while the last heuristic solely relies on log ratios. The first also handles edge cases, such as empty bins.

Comparing (1st) vs (11th), the first combines Newtonian and ratio-based approaches with adaptive weighting, while the 11th uses a Newtonian Optimization Heuristic. The first is more robust by including a ratio component and adaptive weighting, which is lacking in the latter.

Comparing (7th) vs (11th), both include a check for valid bins and a Newtonian-inspired potential calculation. However, the 7th heuristic incorporates a proportion filled metric and a small random factor, which the 11th lacks, leading to more exploration.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), the 9th combines multiple heuristics (capacity ratio, fit score, bin usage, Newtonian) with adaptive weighting based on item size, while the 10th combines volume utilization, balance, and a large item penalty with fixed weights. The adaptive weighting in the 9th makes it more flexible.

Comparing (16th) vs (17th), only one has a default parameter. The 16th version includes an `invalid_priority` parameter which allows more explicit control over handling invalid bins, while the 17th does not have it. This added parameter and the flexibility to control it makes the 16th superior.

Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors (Newtonian potential, ratios, capacity utilization, item fit), often with adaptive weighting based on item size or bin fill level. They also include robust error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid bins) and sometimes a random factor for exploration. Simpler heuristics that rely on a single factor or lack adaptive weighting tend to perform worse. The use of `np.clip` to bound ratio values is another common feature in well-performing functions, which enhances stability.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights. Ensure robust error handling, especially for edge cases like division by zero. Incorporating a small degree of randomness can also aid in exploration and prevent stagnation.
