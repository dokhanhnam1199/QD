Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Returns priority with which we want to add item to each bin.\n    Newtonian Optimization Heuristic: Inspired by gravitational potential,\n    prioritizes bins based on how \"close\" the item's size is to the bin's\n    remaining capacity, scaled by the remaining capacity itself.\n\n    Args:\n        item: Size of item to be added to the bin.\n        bins_remain_cap: Array of capacities for each bin.\n\n    Return:\n        Array of same size as bins_remain_cap with priority score of each bin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Avoid division by zero and negative capacity\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n      return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    safe_bins_remain_cap = np.where(valid_bins, bins_remain_cap, np.inf)\n\n    # Calculate \"gravitational potential\" - higher potential = higher priority\n    potential = (safe_bins_remain_cap / np.abs(safe_bins_remain_cap - item))\n\n    # Further emphasize bins with capacities closest to the item size but also penalize overflowing the bin\n    priorities = np.where(safe_bins_remain_cap >= item, potential, -np.inf)\n    priorities = np.nan_to_num(priorities, neginf=-np.inf) # Handle inf values when item >> safe_bins_remain_cap after masking\n    priorities = np.where(~valid_bins, -np.inf, priorities) # Ensure that bins that are initially invalid has -inf priorities\n\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, here's a refined take on \"Current Self-Reflection\" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, iterative, context-aware, validation.\n*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that adapt to the problem instance, learn from past iterations, and incorporate contextual information. Rigorously validate heuristic performance across diverse scenarios.\n*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single solutions, neglecting edge cases, static approaches unresponsive to changing conditions, and insufficient testing.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are not \"one-size-fits-all.\" They evolve and adjust based on feedback and awareness of the specific problem characteristics. Continuous validation ensures robustness.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
