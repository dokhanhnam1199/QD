**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of Newtonian potential, capacity ratio, bin utilization, adaptive weighting, and stochastic exploration while the worst heuristic uses only the log of the ratio between the item size and the remaining bin capacity. (2nd) vs (19th) shows same as (1st) vs (20th) with less effect; Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see the best heuristic adds bin utilization and stochastic exploration compared to the second best. (3rd) vs (4th) shows the same functionality; Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see both heuristics only use log ratios, but the second worst adds a lot of unused library imports; Overall: Better heuristics combine multiple factors, adaptively weight them, and use stochastic exploration. The worst heuristic is too simplistic, and higher-ranked heuristics also benefit from considerations like bin utilization and penalties for near misses.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, start with a simple baseline and iteratively add complexity by incorporating multiple relevant factors, adaptive weighting, and exploration mechanisms. Remember to profile and tune the weights and exploration parameters for the specific problem instance.
