Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines Newtonian potential and capacity ratio with adaptive weighting.\"\"\"\n\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    safe_bins_remain_cap = np.where(valid_bins, bins_remain_cap, np.inf)\n\n    # Newtonian component (Focuses on bins close to the item size)\n    potential = safe_bins_remain_cap / np.abs(safe_bins_remain_cap - item + 1e-9)\n    newtonian_priority = np.where(safe_bins_remain_cap >= item, potential, -np.inf)\n\n    # Capacity ratio component (Prioritizes bins that have space relative to item)\n    capacity_ratio = np.clip(safe_bins_remain_cap / (item + 1e-9), 0.001, 1000)\n    ratio_priority = np.log(capacity_ratio)\n\n    # Adaptive weighting based on item size relative to *available* capacity\n    weight = np.clip(item / (np.mean(bins_remain_cap[valid_bins]) + 1e-9), 0.0, 1.0)\n\n    # Combine the priorities with adaptive weighting\n    combined_priority = weight * newtonian_priority + (1 - weight) * ratio_priority\n\n    combined_priority = np.nan_to_num(combined_priority, neginf=-np.inf)\n    priorities = np.where(~valid_bins, -np.inf, combined_priority)\n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's redefine \"Current Self-Reflection\" to focus on impactful heuristic design and avoid common pitfalls. We'll aim for actionable advice based on a deeper understanding of the process.\n\nHere's a revised reflection designed to guide better heuristic development:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Contextual awareness, adaptive exploration, validation, iterative refinement.\n*   **Advice:** Instead of blindly combining factors, deeply analyze the *relationships* between them. Prioritize understanding the *why* behind each factor's influence. Design for iterative refinement and validation using diverse datasets.\n*   **Avoid:** Premature complexity, relying solely on sophisticated calculations without clear justification, neglecting the importance of validation and data diversity.\n*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are built on understanding the problem's landscape, not just throwing equations at it. Prioritize adaptability and rigorously test assumptions throughout the development process.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
