Okay, I'm ready to analyze these heuristics and provide some guidance for designing better ones.

**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combined approach, considering both capacity difference and the proportion of the bin filled, with a small random factor for exploration and safety checks. The worst heuristic simply calculates the log of the ratio of item size to bin capacity.

Comparing (5th) vs (11th), the 5th heuristic combines "Newtonian" and ratio-based approaches with adaptive weighting and clamping for stability. The 11th heuristic uses only a "Newtonian" approach. The adaptive weighting based on item size relative to bin capacity seems to make the combined approach superior.

Comparing (14th) vs (17th), we see that even incomplete Newtonian is better.

Comparing (2nd) vs (3rd), (3rd) vs (4th), we see that they are exactly the same.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), we see that they are exactly the same.

Comparing (18th) vs (19th), (19th) vs (20th), we see that they are exactly the same.

Overall: The better heuristics employ more sophisticated calculations, considering multiple factors (capacity difference, fill proportion, ratios). They also include safety checks (avoiding division by zero, negative capacities) and mechanisms to prevent stagnation (random factors, clamping). Adaptive weighting appears to be a crucial element. Simpler ratio-based approaches are less effective. Using different libraries doesn't help. Incomplete valid checks are useless.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights. Implement comprehensive safety checks and mechanisms to avoid local optima. Start with complete code. More sophisticated calculation are better.
