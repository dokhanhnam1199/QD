Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided heuristics and give advice on designing better ones.

**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see a vast difference in complexity. The best heuristic incorporates Newtonian potential, capacity ratio, bin utilization, adaptive weighting, and stochastic exploration, while the worst only uses a simple log ratio.

Comparing (1st) vs (19th), we observe that the 1st heuristic refines the ratio-based approach by adding Newtonian potential, bin utilization consideration, adaptive weighting based on item size, and stochastic exploration for diversity. The 19th heuristic uses the same approach as the 20th.

Comparing (1st) vs (18th), we note that 1st heuristic includes checks for valid bins and handles edge cases (like division by zero). The 18th is incomplete.

Comparing (2nd) vs (17th), the 2nd combines Newtonian potential, capacity ratio, and fragmentation penalty with adaptive weighting, while 17th takes into consideration bin size to calculate its components such as capacity ratio, item fit score, bin usage and modified Newtonian.

Comparing (14th) vs (15th), these are identical.

Comparing (15th) vs (16th), 15th uses only Newtonian potential, while 16th uses Newtonian potential and log ratios.

Comparing (11th) vs (12th), they are identical.

Comparing (12th) vs (13th), they are identical.

Comparing (6th) vs (7th), they are identical.

Comparing (7th) vs (8th), they are identical.

Comparing (8th) vs (9th), they are identical.

Comparing (9th) vs (10th), they are different.

Overall: The best heuristics incorporate a multi-faceted approach, combining several factors like Newtonian potential, capacity ratio, and bin utilization. Adaptive weighting based on item size and available capacity appears crucial. Stochastic exploration adds robustness. Penalties for fragmentation or near-misses can also improve performance. The simpler heuristics rely only on capacity ratios and perform the worst. Handling edge cases (division by zero, invalid bins) robustly is critical for stability. The middle-ranked heuristics attempt to combine Newtonian and ratio-based methods, sometimes with a fragmentation penalty.

**Experience:**

When designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using adaptive weights. Always handle edge cases to ensure stability. Introduce stochasticity for exploration and consider penalties to avoid undesirable outcomes like fragmentation. Start simple, then iteratively add complexity.
