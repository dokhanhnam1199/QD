Okay, let's refine "Current Self-Reflection" to design better heuristics, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Keywords:** Multifactorial, Adaptive, Robustness, Edge Cases, Exploration.

*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that combine diverse, contextually relevant factors. Employ adaptive mechanisms to dynamically weight these factors. Prioritize exploration to escape local optima.

*   **Avoid:** Oversimplification, Single-factor reliance, Premature optimization (start broad).

*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics balance complexity with adaptability. A multifactorial approach, dynamically weighted, allows for nuanced decision-making and greater robustness across diverse scenarios. Focus on robust code by starting with complete code.
