Okay, here's a refined take on "Current Self-Reflection" for better heuristic design, focusing on actionable advice and avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive, iterative, context-aware, validation.
*   **Advice:** Design heuristics that adapt to the problem instance, learn from past iterations, and incorporate contextual information. Rigorously validate heuristic performance across diverse scenarios.
*   **Avoid:** Over-reliance on single solutions, neglecting edge cases, static approaches unresponsive to changing conditions, and insufficient testing.
*   **Explanation:** Effective heuristics are not "one-size-fits-all." They evolve and adjust based on feedback and awareness of the specific problem characteristics. Continuous validation ensures robustness.
