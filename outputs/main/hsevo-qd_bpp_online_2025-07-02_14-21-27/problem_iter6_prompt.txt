Your task is to write a priority function for Solving online Bin Packing Problem (BPP). BPP requires packing a set of items of various sizes into the smallest number of fixed-sized bins. Online BPP requires packing an item as soon as it is received.\nThe priority function takes as input an item and an array of bins_remain_cap (containing the remaining capacity of each bin) and returns a priority score for each bin. The bin with the highest priority score will be selected for the item.\n\n\nCurrent heuristics:\ndef priority_v1(item: float, bins_remain_cap: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n\n    \"\"\"Combines Newtonian and ratio-based approaches with adaptive weighting.\"\"\"\n    valid_bins = bins_remain_cap > 0\n    if not np.any(valid_bins):\n        return np.zeros_like(bins_remain_cap)\n\n    safe_bins_remain_cap = np.where(valid_bins, bins_remain_cap, np.inf)\n    \n    # Newtonian component\n    potential = safe_bins_remain_cap / np.abs(safe_bins_remain_cap - item)\n    newtonian_priority = np.where(safe_bins_remain_cap >= item, potential, -np.inf)\n\n    # Ratio-based component\n    ratio_priority = np.log(np.clip(safe_bins_remain_cap / item, 0.001, 1000))  # Clip for stability\n\n    # Adaptive weighting based on item size relative to bin capacity\n    weight = np.clip(item / (safe_bins_remain_cap + 1e-9), 0.0, 1.0) # Avoid zero division\n    combined_priority = weight * newtonian_priority + (1 - weight) * ratio_priority\n\n    combined_priority = np.nan_to_num(combined_priority, neginf=-np.inf)\n    priorities = np.where(~valid_bins, -np.inf, combined_priority)\n    \n    return priorities\n\nNow, think outside the box write a mutated function `priority_v2` better than current version.\nYou can use some hints below:\n- \nOkay, let's refine \"Current self-reflection\" to build better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls:\n\n*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, robustness, validation, multi-faceted evaluation.\n\n*   **Advice:** Focus on iteratively refining heuristics through rigorous testing and performance analysis. Adapt the complexity of the heuristic to the specific problem characteristics and computational constraints.\n\n*   **Avoid:** Blindly pursuing complexity or relying solely on inspiration from unrelated fields without thorough validation.\n\n*   **Explanation:** Emphasize learning from results and adapting the heuristic. Instead of \"more sophisticated is better\", prioritize effective complexity matched to the problem.\n\n\nOutput code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ```python ... ```.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better solution!"}
