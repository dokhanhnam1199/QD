Okay, let's refine "Current self-reflection" to build better heuristics, avoiding pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive learning, robustness, validation, multi-faceted evaluation.

*   **Advice:** Focus on iteratively refining heuristics through rigorous testing and performance analysis. Adapt the complexity of the heuristic to the specific problem characteristics and computational constraints.

*   **Avoid:** Blindly pursuing complexity or relying solely on inspiration from unrelated fields without thorough validation.

*   **Explanation:** Emphasize learning from results and adapting the heuristic. Instead of "more sophisticated is better", prioritize effective complexity matched to the problem.
