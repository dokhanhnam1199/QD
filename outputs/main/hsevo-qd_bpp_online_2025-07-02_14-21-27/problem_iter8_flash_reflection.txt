**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic combines Newtonian and ratio-based approaches with adaptive weighting and safety checks, while the worst one only uses the ratio of item size to bin capacity and takes the negative logarithm of it; (2nd best) vs (2nd worst) presents the same distinction. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), we see that they are identical, implying redundancy in the ranking. (3rd) vs (4th) are identical, indicating another redundancy. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The best heuristics combine multiple factors (Newtonian potential, ratio, adaptive weighting) with careful handling of edge cases (invalid bins, division by zero). Simpler heuristics focusing on only one factor (e.g., ratio alone) perform poorly. Inclusion of adaptive weighting and safety checks seems to significantly improve performance. Duplicate heuristics exist, indicating a flawed evaluation process.

**Experience:**
When designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors and use adaptive weights to adjust their influence based on context. Always handle edge cases and numerical stability issues. Avoid simple, single-factor heuristics. Ensure thorough testing to eliminate redundant or poorly performing heuristics.
