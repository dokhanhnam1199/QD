**Analysis:**

Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of Newtonian potential, capacity ratio, bin utilization, and stochastic exploration, with adaptive weighting based on item size, while the worst heuristic uses only the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. (2nd best) vs (second worst): the second-best heuristic also uses Newtonian potential and capacity ratio but adds a fragmentation penalty and adaptive weighting. (1st) vs (2nd), the best heuristic incorporates bin utilization and stochastic exploration, which are absent in the second-best. The best also has exploration factor, and the 2nd one does not have it.
(3rd) vs (4th): They are identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), we see that both use a simple ratio-based approach, but the second worst includes numpy and some calculations, while the worst is simpler. The later one are more straightforward and have not used `numpy` well.
Overall: The better heuristics incorporate more factors, use adaptive weighting, and include stochastic exploration to avoid local optima. They also handle edge cases more robustly by checking valid bins and avoiding division by zero. The worse heuristics are simpler but less effective because they ignore important factors and are prone to getting stuck in local optima.

**Experience:**

To design better heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weighting and stochastic exploration. Handle edge cases carefully and validate the heuristic's performance across a wide range of scenarios. Avoid over-engineering, but prioritize a balance between simplicity and effectiveness.
