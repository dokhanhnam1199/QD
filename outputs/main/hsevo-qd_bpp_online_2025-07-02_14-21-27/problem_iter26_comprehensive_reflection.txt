Okay, let's redefine "Current Self-Reflection" to create better heuristic design strategies. Here's a breakdown focusing on actionable improvements and avoiding common pitfalls, aiming for a balanced and effective approach:

*   **Keywords:** Iterative refinement, problem-specific tuning, balanced complexity, empirical validation.

*   **Advice:** Begin with a basic, interpretable heuristic. Progressively enhance it based on *problem-specific* performance data and insights. Focus on understanding *why* a factor improves results, not just adding it.

*   **Avoid:** Prematurely optimizing for complexity. Avoid overly relying on inspiration from unrelated domains without clear justification and rigorous testing. Don't equate sophistication with effectiveness.

*   **Explanation:** Heuristic design should be an iterative process driven by empirical results. Start simple, then refine by adding complexity only when demonstrably beneficial and well-understood within the problem's context. Prioritize interpretability and validation to avoid over-fitting to specific scenarios.
