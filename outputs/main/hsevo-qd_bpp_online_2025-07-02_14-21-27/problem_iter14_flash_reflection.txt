**Analysis:**
Comparing (1st) vs (20th), we see the best heuristic uses a combination of Newtonian potential and capacity ratio with adaptive weighting, while the worst only uses the ratio component. (2nd) incorporates a fragmentation penalty and stochastic exploration, which are absent in (20th). Comparing (2nd best) vs (second worst), (2nd) includes a fragmentation penalty and exploration, while (19th) solely relies on log ratios. Comparing (1st) vs (2nd), (1st) focuses on adaptive weighting between Newtonian potential and capacity ratio, while (2nd) adds a fragmentation penalty and stochastic exploration. (3rd) vs (4th) show negligible differences; they are essentially identical. Comparing (second worst) vs (worst), they are identical. Overall: The better heuristics combine multiple factors (Newtonian potential, capacity ratio, fragmentation penalty) and use adaptive weighting to adjust their behavior based on item size and bin capacity. The poorer heuristics rely on simpler calculations, such as just the ratio of item size to remaining capacity. Adding stochastic elements may improve exploration.

**Experience:**
Combining multiple heuristics with adaptive weighting and stochastic exploration can significantly improve performance. Consider factors like fragmentation and bin utilization when designing heuristics. Simpler heuristics may be computationally efficient but can lead to suboptimal solutions.
