Your task is to provide useful advice based on analysis to design better heuristics.\n", "user": "Your task is to redefine 'Current self-reflection' paying attention to avoid all things in 'Ineffective self-reflection' in order to come up with ideas to design better heuristics.\n\n### Current self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, start with a simple baseline and iteratively add complexity by incorporating multiple relevant factors, adaptive weighting, and exploration mechanisms. Remember to profile and tune the weights and exploration parameters for the specific problem instance.\nWhen designing heuristics, prioritize nuanced approaches that consider multiple factors and edge cases. A simple solution may be computationally efficient, but often sacrifices accuracy and robustness. Consider inspiration from other fields like physics to create advanced heuristics.\n```\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights. Implement comprehensive safety checks and mechanisms to avoid local optima. Start with complete code. More sophisticated calculation are better.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights. Ensure robust error handling, especially for edge cases like division by zero. Incorporating a small degree of randomness can also aid in exploration and prevent stagnation.\n\nCombining multiple heuristics with adaptive weighting and stochastic exploration can significantly improve performance.

Simpler heuristics may be computationally efficient but can lead to suboptimal solutions.\n```\n\n### Ineffective self-reflection\nWhen designing heuristics, combine multiple relevant factors and use adaptive weights to adjust their influence based on context. Always handle edge cases and numerical stability issues. Avoid simple, single-factor heuristics. Ensure thorough testing to eliminate redundant or poorly performing heuristics.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weights. Incorporate exploration mechanisms to escape local optima. Avoid over-simplification and try to capture the complexities of the problem domain for better performance.\n\nWhen designing heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors using adaptive weights. Always handle edge cases to ensure stability. Introduce stochasticity for exploration and consider penalties to avoid undesirable outcomes like fragmentation. Start simple, then iteratively add complexity.\n\nTo design better heuristics, consider combining multiple relevant factors with adaptive weighting and stochastic exploration. Handle edge cases carefully and validate the heuristic's performance across a wide range of scenarios. Avoid over-engineering, but prioritize a balance between simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nResponse (<100 words) should have 4 bullet points: Keywords, Advice, Avoid, Explanation.\nI'm going to tip $999K for a better heuristics!
