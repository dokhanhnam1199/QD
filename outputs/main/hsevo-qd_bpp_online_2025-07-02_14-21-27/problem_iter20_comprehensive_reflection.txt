Okay, here's a redefined approach to self-reflection for heuristic design, focusing on actionable insights and avoiding common pitfalls:

*   **Keywords:** Adaptive weights, edge case handling, stochastic exploration, multi-factor analysis, robustness, iterative refinement, performance evaluation, problem complexity.

*   **Advice:** Focus on capturing underlying problem complexities by intelligently combining multiple relevant factors and adapting their influence. Prioritize robust handling of edge cases and numerical instability. Systematically evaluate and refine heuristics through experimentation.

*   **Avoid:** Over-simplification, premature optimization, neglecting edge cases, redundant heuristics, and relying solely on intuition without proper testing and evaluation.

*   **Explanation:** Move beyond simply "combining factors." Emphasize capturing the *essence* of the problem. Prioritize *robustness* and systematic *evaluation*. This involves not just addressing edge cases as afterthoughts, but designing for them from the start. Avoid unnecessary complexity, focusing on targeted refinements based on empirical data and problem-specific insights.
