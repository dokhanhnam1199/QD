The `update_edge_distance` function takes as input a matrix of edge distances, a locally optimized tour, and a matrix indicating the number of times each edge has been used. It returns an updated matrix of edge distances that incorporates the effects of the local optimization and edge usage. The returned matrix has the same shape as the input `edge_distance` matrix, with the distances adjusted based on the provided tour and usage data.
